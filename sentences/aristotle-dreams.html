<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps we may <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> it as true that the dreamer sees nothing, yet as false that his faculty of sense-perception is unaffected, the fact being that the sense of seeing and the other senses may possibly be then in a certain way affected, while each of these affections, as duly as when he is awake, gives its impulse in a certain manner to his [primary] faculty of sense, though not in precisely the same manner as when he is awake.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 2 We can best obtain a scientific view of the nature of the dream and the manner in which it originates by <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing it in the light of the circumstances attending sleep.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again if, after having looked at the sun or some other brilliant object, we close the eyes, then, if we watch <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully, it appears in a right line with the direction of vision (whatever this may be), at first in its own colour; then it changes to crimson, next to purple, until it becomes black and disappears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the sensory organs are acutely sensitive to even a slight qualitative difference [in their objects] is shown by what happens in the case of mirrors; a subject to which, even taking it independently, one might devote close <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to answer our original <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, let us now, therefore, assume one proposition, which is clear from what precedes, viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>that even when the external object of perception has departed, the impressions it has made persist, and are themselves objects of perception: and [let us assume], besides, that we are easily deceived <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the operations of sense-perception when we are excited by emotions, and different persons according to their different emotions; for example, the coward when excited by fear, the amorous person by amorous desire; so that, with but little resemblance to go upon, the former thinks he sees his foes approaching, the latter, that he sees the object of his desire; and the more deeply one is under the influence of the emotion, the less similarity is required to give rise to these illusory impressions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ground of such false <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong>s is that any appearances whatever present themselves, not only when its object stimulates a sense, but also when the sense by itself alone is stimulated, provided only it be stimulated in the same manner as it is by the object.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In sanguineous animals, in proportion as the blood becomes calm, and as its purer are separated from its less pure elements, the fact that the movement, based on impressions derived from each of the organs of sense, is preserved in its <strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong>, renders the dreams healthy, causes a [clear] image to present itself, and makes the dreamer think, owing to the effects borne in from the organ of sight, that he actually sees, and owing to those which come from the organ of hearing, that he really hears; and so on with those also which proceed from the other sensory organs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some persons, too, return answers to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s put to them in sleep.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are cases of persons who in their whole lives have never had a dream, while others dream when considerably <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in years, having never dreamed before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is not surprising that, as age <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s, a dream should at length appear to them.</li>
