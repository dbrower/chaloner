<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some Philosophical Questions 20 3.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton's Questiones, Add MS 3996, f.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a youth he assimilated or rediscovered most of the mathematics known to humankind and then invented the calculus-the machinery by which the modern world <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s change and flow-but kept this treasure to himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I don't know what I may seem to the world," he said before he died, "but, as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> lay all undis­ covered before me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It pleased Voltaire to compare Newton with his nation's late philosophical hero, René Descartes: "For your Cartesians everything is moved by an impulsion you don't really <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, for Mr Newton it is by gravitation, the cause of which is hardly better known.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He wrote for himself, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less of food and sleep.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Smith wanted a wife, not a 9 ISAAC NEWTON stepson; under the negotiated terms of their marriage Han­ nah abandoned Isaac in the Woolsthorpe house, leaving him to his grandmother's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Other prerequisites were lenses, paper and ink, mechanical clocks, numeric systems capable of denoting indefinitely small fractions, and postal <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s spanning hundreds of miles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Woolsthorpe anyone who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d to know the hour con­ sulted Isaac's dials.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still, no one could perfect or even <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> sun-dials until all the shifting pieces of a puzzle had been assembled: the shad­ ows, the rhythms, the orbits of planets, the special geometry of the ellipse, the attraction of matter by matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He filled a Latin exercise book with unselfcon­ scious phrases, some copied, others invented, a grim stream of thought: A little felloto; My poore <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>; Hee is paile; There is no room for me to sit; In the top of the house-In the bottom of hell; U7hat imployment is he fit for? U7hat is hee good for?14 He despaired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Did the earth move? Copernicus had revived that notion, "not as a <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, but a supposition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>17 ISAAC NEWTON Bate's book mixed Aristotelianism and folklore: "sun­ dry Experiments both <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able and delightfull, which because they are confusedly intermixed, I have entituled them Extravagants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>19 2 Some Philosophical Questions HE DID NOT KNOW what he wanted to be or do, but it was not tend sheep or follow the plow and the dung cart.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cam­ bridge recognized students in three categories: noblemen, who dined at high table, wore sophisticated gowns, and received degrees with little examination; pensioners, who 20 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS paid for tuition and board and aimed, mainly, for the Angli­ can ministry; and sizars, who earned their keep by menial <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to other students, running errands, waiting on them at meals, and eating their leftovers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He felt learning as a form of obsession, a worthy pursuit, in God's <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, but potentially prideful as well.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>? Newton, scrupulous with his limited funds, bought books there and, one year, a glass prism-a toy, imprecisely ground, fl<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d with air bubbles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Supplemented by ancient poets and medieval divines, it was a complete edu­ cation, which scarcely changed from generation to genera- 22 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS tian.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we understood the cause of motion, we would <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the cause of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This simple <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> implied a first mover, put in motion by no other, to break what must otherwise be an infinite loop: Since everything that is in motion must be moved by something, let us take the case in which a thing is in locomotion and is moved by something that is itself in 23 ISAAC NEWTON motion, .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indeed, the Greeks had a principled resistance to mathematiciz­ ing our corruptible, fl<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d, sublunary world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of an object falling from a tower or rolling down an inclined plane, people could begin to ask: what is the distance? what is the time? What, therefore, is the velocity? And how does the veloc­ ity, itself, change? 24 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS Nor was Aristotle's cosmology faring well outside Cam­ bridge's gates.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Later, trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> free fall, he reached the modern definition, correctly assimilating units of distance, units of speed, and units of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton began to absorb this, at second or third hand; Galileo had written mostly in Italian, a language few in England could read;'? In Newton's second year, having filled the beginning and end of his notebook with Aristotle, he started a new section deep inside: Questiones quœdam philosophicce-some philo­ sophical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aris­ totle had said, "Plato is my friend, but <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> my greater friend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Could he know, by the force oflogic, whether matter was continuous and infinitely divis­ ible, or discontinuous and discrete? Were its ultimate parts 26 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS mathematical points or actual atoms? Since a mathemati­ cal point lacks body or dimension-"is but an imaginary entity" -it seemed implausible that even an infinite number of them could combine to form matter with real extension, IS even if bits of vacuum ("interspersed inanities") separated the parts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of God's role, as creator, could be dangerous territory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I6 He invoked God on another contro­ versial <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>: Is space finite or infinite? Not the imagi­ nary abstract space of geometers, but the real space in which we live.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No abstract disputation here; he just sketched a wheel-shaped clock, to be driven by water or sand, and raised wholly practical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s about making 27 ISAAC NEWTON clocks with various materi­ als, such as "metalline globu­ lar dust.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether Cartes his first element can turne about the vor­ tex & yet drive the matter of it continually from the 0 28 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS [sun] to produce light, & spend most of its motion in filling up the chinks between the globuli.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"!" Another elusive word, gravity, began to appear in the Questiones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet how could the cannonball be <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed along by the air? He noted that the air crowds more upon the front of a pro­ jectile than on the rear, "& must therefore rather hinder it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had set out his <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>30 SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS One more mystery: the Flux & Reflux of the Sea.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed whether the sea level rose by day and fell by night; whether it was higher in the morning or evening.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though fishermen and sailors around the globe had stud­ ied the tides for thousands of years, people had not amassed enough data to settle those <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before long, in a few texts, he had at hand a précis of the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d mathematics available on the continent of Europe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He set himself problems; considered them obsessively; calculated answers, and asked new <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Most of the numerical <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s and methods that people had discovered, they had forgotten and rediscovered, again and again, in cultures far removed from one another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"9 But by mathematics he did not mean numbers: "Its char­ acters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> a sin­ gle word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He read Euclid <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully now.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s the mental faculty we call mathemati­ cal intuition; much less, genius.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A powerful source of <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> is a facility in translat­ ing, seeing how the same thing can be said in seemingly different ways.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Truth, he said much later, was "the offspring of silence and meditation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seems that nobody has any business to think about such matters unless he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s his own mind as infinite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"We are among infinities and indivisibles," Galileo said, "the former incomprehensible to our <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing by reason of their largeness, and the latter by their smallness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"25 He could not escape it, so he pressed it into <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, employing a pri­ vate symbol-a little Q-for this quantity that was and was not zero.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The science most eager to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the motion of earthly objects, ballistics, measured the angles of gun barrels and the distances their balls traveled, but 43 ISAAC NEWTON scarcely conceived of velocity; even when they could define this quantity, as a ratio of distance and time, they could not measure it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed this oddity as suspect and unmathe­ matical, because it could not (before the calculus) be de­ scribed analytically.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"> He learned, "with all the <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> of sense evidence," that the moon "is not robed in a smooth polished surface but is in fact rough and uneven.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet without <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing motion, no one could place the heavenly bodies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"? How far could reason lead, without <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>? Francis Bacon, who had practiced logic and disputation as the king's Learned Counsel and Attorney-General, lamented a natu­ ral philosophy built solely on words, ostentation, the elabo­ rate knitting together of established ideas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After all, time is the father of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>; ages passed before men crossed the seas and found other men at the far side of the world; surely other excellent mysteries remain to be discovered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"What a 52 TWO GREAT ORBS huddling and confusion must there be, if there were two places for gravity and two places for lightness?" 13 Which way should bodies of that other world fall? To where should its air and fire ascend? Can we expect pieces of the moon to fall to earth? He answered these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in the terms of Copernicus and Kepler: by proposing that two worlds must have two centers of gravity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Up and down became relative terms, in the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>s of philosophers, contrary to common experi­ ence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any other body that is like affected coming within this sphere will presently 53 ISAAC NEWTON descend towards the centre of it, and in that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> may be styled heavy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, then, did it hang gently downward, instead of being flung outward like a stone whirled around on a string? The same <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> applied to the moon: what pushed it or pulled it away from a straight path? Many years later Newton told at least four people that he had been inspired by an apple in his Woolsthorpe garden­ perhaps an apple actually falling from a tree, perhaps not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had tried some out in the Questiones, and now, in the plague year, he tried again.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Introspec­ tion told him that his <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> could see things as they really were.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Phantasie is <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed," he noted, "by good aire fasting moderate wine.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"! He wished to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> light itself-but did light's essence lie outside or within the soul of the observer? In all the blooming perplexity of new philosophy, little was as muddled as the boundary between the perceived and the perceiver.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The poet Andrew Marvell, graduate of Trinity College and now Member of Parliament for Hull, imagined the body and soul as enslaved, each by the other: "A soul hung up, as 'twere, in chains of nerves and arteries and veins.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>N ewton, in his Questiones, had pondered the difficulty of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the senses, when those very senses were em­ ployed as the agents of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" depends on "<strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> and fantasy and invention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wonders were revealed there.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooke lacked mathematics but not <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He invented or <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d barometers, thermometers, and wind gauges, and he tracked London weather obsessively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"By the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of Microscopes, there is nothing so small, as to escape our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>," he declared.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" 16 He found <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ment in the edge of a razor and the weft of fine linen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bacon had also warned: "God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> for a pattern of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>66 6 The Oddest If Not the Most Considerable Detection NEwTON'S STATUS AT TRINITY <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He sent books to Newton and posed <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s: for example, how to calculate the rate of interest on an annuity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton sent a formula for that but insisted that his name be withheld if Collins published it: "For I see not what there is desirable in publick <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>e, were I able to acquire & maintaine it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>?" When Barrow prepared his lectures for publication, he asked Newton to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him edit the manuscripts, particu­ larly his Optical Lectures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was a favorite of the king, hoped for <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment, and thought of himself more as a theologian than a mathematician.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed this obli­ gation far more than he fulfilled it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then, as an acquaintance put it, "this Curious German having well <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d himself by his Travels, and rubbed his Brains against those of other People, was entertained as a Per- son of great Merit, and so made Secretary to the Royal Society.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>ês N a sooner had the virtuosi begun to gather than Eng­ land's poets satirized their fixations and their <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Which way the dreadful comet went / In sixty-four and what it meant?" asked Samuel Butler (his mockery tinged with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Sr," Oldenburg wrote, "Your Ingenuity is the occasion of this addresse by a hand unknowne to you .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still, there were <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of the skillful examiners agreed that Newton's tube magnified more than larger telescopes, but others said this was hard to measure with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton wrote back with conventional false <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>: I was surprised to see so much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> taken about securing an invention to mee, of which I have hitherto had so little value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>v A fortnight later he set <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> aside.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"> He noted this in passing because he had <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed whether rays of light could swerve the same way-if they "should possibly be globular bodies" spinning against the ether.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>5 A <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully formed triangular prism manifested colors most perfectly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He aligned these and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully rotated one prism in his hand, directing first blue light and then red light through the second prism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Some colors are refracted more, and not by any quality of the glass but by their own pre<strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>f But the most surprising, and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful composition was that of Whiteness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He exposed intimate feelings: his pleasure at the display of colors, his un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>, and then above all his surprise and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"? Oldenburg kept assuring him of the society's applause for his <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> and frank­ ness and its concern that the honor of discovery might be snatched from him and assumed by foreigners.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Regarding light, however, he had exposed himself, and he regretted 85 ISAAC NEWTON it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he knows well that it is not for one man to prescribe Rules to the studies of another, especially not without <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the grounds on which he proceeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooke insisted on "denying some things the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of which would have appeared by an experimentall examina­ tion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In suggesting that light was composed of particles, he had <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>­ fully used the word perhaps.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> how Mr Hook could imagin that when I had asserted the Theory with the great- 87 ISAAC NEWTON est rigor, 1 should be so forgetfull as afterwards to assert the fundamentall supposition it selfe with no more than a perhaps.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of refraction and reflection was profound-and correct enough, when alloyed with New­ ton's, to survive up to the quantum era.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he, too, by way ofletters to Oldenburg, raised initial <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s about New­ ton's "hypothesis" and in return feit the young man's wrath.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Oldenburg begged him to reconsider, suggested he no longer feel obliged to pay his dues, and assured him that the Royal Society <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed and loved him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>>' He had discovered a great <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He noted that "some" could not quite take his meaning when he spoke of light and color in the abstract, and perhaps they would <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> better with an illustration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And he wanted his lis­ teners to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> a delicate rhetorical point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He did not pretend to mathematical <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> here, even if, for conven­ ience," he chose to "speak of it as if I assumed it & pro­ pounded it to be beleived.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was a work of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was no static world, no orderly world he sought to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> now.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Large vibrations are red-or, as he said more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully, cause the sensation of red.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Hooke was poking at a soft spot in Newton's <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>­ ing of light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton both exposed his un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> and concealed it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Your Designes and myne I suppose aim both at the same thing which is the Discovery of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and I sup­ pose we can both endure to hear objections.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"What's done before many witnesses is seldome without some further concern than that for <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>: but what passes between friends in private usually deserves the name of consultation rather than contest, & so I hope it will prove between you & me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You have added much several ways, & especially in taking the colours of thin plates into philosophical <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He stayed in his chamber for days at a time, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less of meals, working by candlelight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Noone could <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> till centuries later-after his papers, long hidden and scattered, began finally to be reassembled-that he had been not only a secret alchemist but, in the breadth of his knowledge and his experimenta­ tion, the peerless alchemist of Europe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For any practitioner of chemistry or alchemy, one <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> loomed: what made particles cohere in the first place>'? What caused inert atoms to stick together, to form minerals and crystals and-even more <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully-plants and animals? The Cartesian style was recklessly ad hoc, Newton thought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As with the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of light's true nature, he chose a narrow rhetorical path: veering past the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of whether his program was or was not fundamentally mechanical, all reduced to particles and forces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"21 For the rest: God who gave Animals self motion beyond our under­ standing is without doubt able to implant other principles 105 ISAAC NEWTON of motion in bodies which we may <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> as little.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There were forces in nature that he would not be able to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> mechani­ cally, in terms of colliding billiard balls or swirling vortices.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>England's universities were above all else instruments of Christianity, and at each step in his Cambridge <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er New­ ton swore oaths avowing his faith.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" 107 ISAAC NEWTON He believed in God, not as a matter of obligation but in the warp and weft of his <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He is all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all force of sensing, of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing, and of acting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He considered this a <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anyone could pursue biblical <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> as a self-directed enterprise; many tried to distinguish the pure Gospel from its medieval accretions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a human Christ does not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> his divinity all at once.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>? In theology as in alchemy, he felt himself to be questing for ancient <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s that had been perverted in the dark his­ tory of the past centuries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He drew a diagram: To make this plainer suppose a, b & <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> 3 bodies of which a hath gravity originally in it self by which it presseth upon b & c which are without any origin all gravity ê but yet by the pressure of a communicated to : them do presse downwards as much as A c doth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Seducers waxing worse and worse," he wrote, "deceiving and being deceived-such as will not endure sound doc­ trine but after their own lusts heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears and turning away their ears from the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Halley served as a sometime <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant to a new office­ holder, the Astronomer Royal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He was not persuaded that the two comets were one and the same, because his exquisitely <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful measurements of their transit, and all the others he could collect-6 degrees a day, 36 minutes a day, 3Yz degrees a day-seemed to show acceleration suddenly al­ ternating with retardation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He made glancing mention of their previous mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>­ ings: "Difference in opinion if such there be me thinks shoud not be the occasion of Enmity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They were dancing around a pair of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, one the mirror of the other: What curve will be traced by a body orbiting another in an inverse-square gravitational field? (An ellipse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Halley put the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to Newton directly in August 1684: supposing an inverse-square law of attraction toward the sun, what sort of curve would a planet make? Newton told him: an ellipse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the best model available for perfection in knowledge, it gave his physical program the stamp of <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A Cambridge student was said to have remarked, as the figure of its author passed by, "There goes the man that writt a book that neither he nor anybody else <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" No one could time a falling body with such <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, but New­ ton had some numbers from beating pendulums, and, per­ forming the arithmetic, he slyly exaggerated the accuracy" He said he had tested gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, salt, wood, water, and wheat-suspending them in a pair of identical wooden boxes from eleven-foot cords and timing these pendulums so precisely that he could detect a differ­ ence of one part in a thousand.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indeed, Huygens, when he first heard about New­ ton's system of the world, replied, "I don't <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that he's not a Cartesian as long as he doesn't serve us up conjectures such as attractions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Truth being uniform, and always the same, it is admirable to observe how easily we are enabled to make out very abstruse and difficult matters, when once true and genuine Principles are obtained.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Locke had just completed a great work of his own, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding) and saw the Principia as an exemplar of methodical knowledge.</li>
