<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Readers who do not speak or read the Greek language will usually neither gain nor lose <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing by skipping over these passages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> Greek, however, may gain a deeper insight to the original meaning and distinctions expressed by Aristotle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Reversal of the Situation, Recognition, and Tragic or disastrous Incident defined and explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>XV The element of Character in Tragedy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Recognition: its various kinds, with examples.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>ARISTOTLE'S POETICS I I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds, noting the essential quality of each; to inquire into the structure of the plot as requisite to a good poem; into the number and nature of the parts of which a poem is composed; and similarly into whatever else falls within the same <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They differ, however, from one: another in three <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s,--the medium, the objects, the manner or mode of imitation, being in each case distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In dancing, rhythm alone is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, emotion, and action, by rhythmical movement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such, then, are the differences of the arts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the medium of imitation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>II Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men must be either of a higher or a lower type (for moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> mainly answers to these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks of moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either as better than in real life, or as worse, or as they are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration--in which case he can either take another <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged--or he may present all his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as living and moving before us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the same kind as Homer--for both imitate higher types of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; from another point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes--for both imitate persons acting and doing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the writers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper types or not; and whether it is to be judged in itself, or in relation also to the audience,--this raises another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tragedy <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by slow degrees; each new element that showed itself was in turn developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>V Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of a lower type, not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the Ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of a higher type.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By 'Diction' I mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words: as for 'Song,' it is a term whose sense every one <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an action implies personal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities both of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and thought; for it is by these that we qualify actions themselves, and these--thought and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>--are the two natural causes from which actions spring, and on actions again all success or failure depends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By Character I mean that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thought is required wherever a statement is proved, or, it may be, a general <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> enunciated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every Tragedy, therefore, must have six parts, which parts determine its quality--namely, Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle, Song.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These elements have been employed, we may say, by the poets to a man; in fact, every play contains Spectacular elements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, Song, and Thought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dramatic action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> comes in as subsidiary to the actions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, without action there cannot be a tragedy; there may be without <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The tragedies of most of our modern poets fail in the rendering of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and of poets in general this is often true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Polygnotus delineates <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> well: the style of Zeuxis is devoid of ethical quality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, if you string together a set of speeches expressive of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and well finished in point of diction and thought, you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well as with a play which, however deficient in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, yet has a plot and artistically constructed incidents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides which, the most powerful elements of emotional: interest in Tragedy Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and Recognition scenes--are parts of the plot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A further proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish: of diction and <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong> of portraiture before they can construct the plot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul of a tragedy: Character holds the second place.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the case of oratory, this is the function of the Political art and of the art of rhetoric: and so indeed the older poets make their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s speak the language of civic life; the poets of our time, the language of the rhetoricians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Character is that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of things a man chooses or avoids.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Speeches, therefore, which do not make this manifest, or in which the speaker does not choose or avoid anything whatever, are not expressive of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But Homer, as in all else he is of surpassing merit, here too--whether from art or natural genius--seems to have happily discerned the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In Comedy this is already apparent: for here the poet first constructs the plot on the lines of probability, and then inserts <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic names;--unlike the lampooners who write about particular individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The tragic <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> will thee be greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident; for even coincidences are most striking when they have an air of design.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An action which is one and continuous in the sense above defined, I call Simple, when the change of fortune takes place without Reversal of the Situation and without Recognition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A Complex action is one in which the change is accompanied by such Reversal, or by Recognition, or by both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The best form of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> is coincident with a Reversal of the Situation, as in the Oedipus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even inanimate things of the most trivial kind may in a sense be objects of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> which is most intimately connected with the plot and action is, as we have said, the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of persons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>, combined, with Reversal, will produce either pity or fear; and actions producing these effects are those which, by our definition, Tragedy represents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Recognition, then, being between persons, it may happen that one person only is recognised by the other-when the latter is already known--or it may be necessary that the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> should be on both sides.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus Iphigenia is revealed to Orestes by the sending of the letter; but another act of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> is required to make Orestes known to Iphigenia.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two parts, then, of the Plot--Reversal of the Situation and Recognition--turn upon surprises.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There remains, then, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between these two extremes,--that of a man who is not eminently good and just,-yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>XV In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Character there are four things to be aimed at.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now any speech or action that manifests moral purpose of any kind will be expressive of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> will be good if the purpose is good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thirdly, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> must be true to life: for this is a distinct thing from goodness and propriety, as here described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As an example of motiveless degradation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, we have Menelaus in the Orestes: of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> indecorous and inappropriate, the lament of Odysseus in the Scylla, and the speech of Melanippe: of inconsistency, the Iphigenia at Aulis,--for Iphigenia the suppliant in no way resembles her later self.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As in the structure of the plot, so too in the portraiture of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus a person of a given <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> should speak or act in a given way, by the rule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should follow that by necessary or probable sequence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So too the poet, in representing men who are irascible or indolent, or have other defects of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, should preserve the type and yet ennoble it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>XVI What Recognition is has been already explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>First, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of wit, is most commonly employed <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> by signs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus in the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of Odysseus by his scar, the discovery is made in one way by the nurse, in another by the swineherds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The use of tokens for the express purpose of proof--and, indeed, any formal proof with or without tokens--is a less artistic mode of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Next come the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>s invented at will by the poet, and on that account wanting in art.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into tears on seeing the picture; or again in the 'Lay of Alcinous,' where Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and weeps; and hence the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' Again, there is a composite kind of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> involving false inference on the part of one of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as in the Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>hence B (the disguised Odysseus) imagined that A would> recognise the bow which, in fact, he had not seen; and to bring about a <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> by this means that the expectation A would recognise the bow is false inference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, of all <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>s, the best is that which arises from the incidents themselves, where the startling discovery is made by natural means.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>s alone dispense with the artificial aid of tokens or amulets.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Next come the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>s by process of reasoning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, the poet should work out his play, to the best of his power, with appropriate gestures; for those who feel emotion are most convincing through natural <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s they represent; and one who is agitated storms, one who is angry rages, with the most life-like reality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the one case a man can take the mould of any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; in the other, he is lifted out of his proper self.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The mode of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> may be either that of Euripides or of Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims very naturally:--'So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed to be sacrificed'; and by that remark he is saved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are four kinds of Tragedy, the Complex, depending entirely on Reversal of the Situation and Recognition; the Pathetic (where the motive is passion),--such as the tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the Ethical (where the motives are ethical),--such as the Phthiotides and the Peleus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In his Reversals of the Situation, however, he shows a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous skill in the effort to hit the popular taste,--to produce a tragic effect that satisfies the moral sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' The Chorus too should be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as one of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, in the manner not of Euripides but of Sophocles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Concerning Thought, we may assume what is said in the Rhetoric, to which <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> the subject more strictly belongs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For what were the business of a speaker, if the Thought were revealed quite apart from what he says? Next, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s Diction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One branch of the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> treats of the Modes of Utterance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It includes, for instance,--what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat, a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, an answer, and so forth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may, therefore, pass this over as an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> that belongs to another art, not to poetry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These are distinguished according to the form assumed by the mouth and the place where they are produced; according as they are aspirated or smooth, long or short; as they are acute, grave, or of an intermediate tone; which <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> belongs in detail to the writers on metre.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> or a command.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So, again, if we take a strange (or rare) word, a metaphor, or any similar mode of expression, and replace it by the current or proper term, the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of our observation will be manifest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In heroic poetry, indeed, all these varieties are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' The parts also, with the exception of song and spectacle, are the same; for it requires Reversals of the Situation, Recognitions, and Scenes of Suffering.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s Homer is our earliest and sufficient model.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indeed each of his poems has a twofold <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Iliad is at once simple and 'pathetic,' and the Odyssey complex (for Recognition scenes run through it), and at the same time 'ethical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s scale or length, we have already laid down an adequate limit:--the beginning and the end must be capable of being brought within a single view.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Homer, admirable in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, has the special merit of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Homer, after a few prefatory words, at once brings in a man, or woman, or other personage; none of them wanting in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities, but each with a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The element of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful is required in Tragedy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The irrational, on which the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful depends for its chief effects, has wider scope in Epic poetry, because there the person acting is not seen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful is pleasing: as may be inferred from the fact that every one tells a story with some addition of his own, knowing that his hearers like it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the mind, knowing the second to be true, falsely infers the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action, where there is no expression of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> or thought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For, conversely, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and thought are merely obscured by a diction that is over brilliant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>XXV With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to critical difficulties and their solutions, the number and nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus exhibited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Other difficulties may be resolved by due <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the usage of language.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'--while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>led at the sound of flutes and pipes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Or again, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be solved by punctuation, as in Empedocles,--'Of a sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to be immortal, and things unmixed before mixed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> about Icarius has been treated in this fashion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We should therefore solve the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> by reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is tacitly assumed by a person of intelligence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, are justly censured when there is no inner necessity for introducing them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>XXVI The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be raised whether the Epic or Tragic mode of imitation is the higher.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it is superior, this fault, we say, is not inherent in it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, Tragedy is superior to Epic poetry in all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, and, moreover, fulfils its specific function better as an art for each art ought to produce, not any chance pleasure, but the pleasure proper to it, as already stated it plainly follows that Tragedy is the higher art, as attaining its end more perfectly.</li>
