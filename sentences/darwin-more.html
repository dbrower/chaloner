<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> I have rather thought that many are only altered forms of existing European genera; but this is a very difficult point, and would require a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful study of such genera and allies with this object in view.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I daresay there is a great deal of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in your remarks on the glacial affair, but we are in a muddle, and shall never agree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Your remarks on my <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing temperate plants and dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing the tropical plants made me at first uncomfortable, but I soon recovered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I have come not to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> at all for general beliefs without the special facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to tropical plants withstanding the slowly coming on cool period, I trust to such facts as yours (and others) about seeds of the same species from mountains and plains having acquired a slightly different climatal constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I threatened your tropical cooling views with the facts of the physicists, you snubbed me and the facts sweetly, over and over again; and now, because a s<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>crow of x+y has been raised on the selfsame facts, you boo-boo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to evolution, Huxley (page 328) ingeniously points out a case of circular reasoning.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> much whether it stands out in the line of any oceanic current, which does not so forcibly strike the main island? But why, oh, why should so many monocotyledons have come there? or why should they have survived there more than on the main island, if once connected? So, again, I cannot conceive that four snakes should have become extinct in Mauritius and survived on Round Island.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Helena, by an officer who knew nothing of my hurried observations, but confirms nearly all that I have said on the general structure of the island, and on its <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous denudation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Your view, supported as it is by various facts, appears to me the most important contribution towards <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the present distribution of plants, which has appeared since Forbes' essay on the effects of the Glacial Period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What progress Palaeontology has made during the last twenty years! but if it <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s at the same rate in the future, our views on the migration and birthplace of the various groups will, I fear, be greatly altered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Though, of course, present results as to the origin and migrations of genera of mammals will have to be modified owing to new discoveries, I cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> thinking that much will remain unaffected, because in all geographical and geological discoveries the great outlines are soon reached, the details alone remain to be modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I hope your health is <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; and when, quite at your leisure, you have waded through my book, I trust you will again let me have a few lines of friendly criticism and advice.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, Mauritius and the other islands appear to me oceanic in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully good paper was published about a year ago on India, in the "Geological Journal," I think by Blanford.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Your <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful account of the temperate parts of South America interested me much, and all the more from knowing something of the country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I began with the intention of writing a comparatively short sketch, enlarged it, and added to it bit by bit; remodelled the tables, the headings, and almost everything else, more than once, and got my materials in such confusion that it is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> it has not turned out far more crooked and confused than it is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It does not <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> much; neither do I think it likely that even the complete observation he thinks necessary would be of much use, because it may well be that the ova, or larvae, or imagos of the beetles are not carried systematically by the ants, but only occasionally, owing to some exceptional circumstances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Several of your remarks in previous letters I shall <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully consider.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Darwin <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s him to mean that the Vascular Cryptogams and Gymnosperms could stand the sea-level atmosphere, whereas the Angiosperms would only be able to exist in the higher regions where the percentage of CO2 was small.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not clear to us that Ball relies so largely on the condition of the atmosphere as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s CO2.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ball draws attention to the imperfection of our plant records as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the floras of mountain regions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Escombe will extend their experiments to Vascular Cryptogams, and thus obtain evidence bearing more directly upon the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of an increased amount of CO2 in the atmosphere of the Coal-period forests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Under nature it is these very aggressive species that would first reach any island in their vicinity, and, being adapted to the island and colonising it thoroughly, would then hold their own against other plants from the same country, mostly less aggressive in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>is no doubt very speculative, and I cannot <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> at your hesitating at accepting my views.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For where could the rich lowland equatorial flora have existed during a period of general refrigeration sufficient for this? and what became of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully rich Cape flora, which, if the temperature of tropical Africa had been so recently lowered, would certainly have spread northwards, and on the return of the heat could hardly have been driven back into the sharply defined and very restricted area in which it now exists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  As to the migration of plants from mountain to mountain not being so probable as to remote islands, I think that is fully counterbalanced by two <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s:--  a.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The temporary occupation of mountain stations by migrating plants (which I think I have shown to be probable) renders time a much more important element in increasing the number and variety of the plants so dispersed than in the case of islands, where the flora soon acquires a fixed and endemic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and where the number of species is necessarily limited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I should very much like to see you discuss some of Wallace's views, especially his ignoring the all-powerful effects of the Glacial period with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to alpine plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Moseley told me not long ago that he proposed to search at Kerguelen Land the coal beds most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully, and was absolutely forbidden to do so by Sir W.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though I differ so much from Wallace, his "Island Life" seems to me a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful book.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I quite agree about Wallace's position on the ocean and continent <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You speak a little doubtfully about the name of the shell, and it would be indispensable to have this ascertained with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I am much obliged for your clear and distinct answers to my <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> I am sorry to trouble you, but there is one point which I do not fully <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Did the shell remain attached to the beetle's leg from the 18th to the 23rd, and was the beetle kept during this time in the air?  Do I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> rightly that after the shell had dropped off, both being in water, that the beetle's antenna was again temporarily caught by the shell?  I presume that I may keep the specimen till I go to London, which will be about the middle of next month.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I suppose you would not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for the fragments to be returned or the Dytiscus; but if you wish for them they shall be returned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have received proof-sheets (with a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully nice letter) of very hostile review by Andrew Murray, read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Horner goes on (page lxx): "The retention of the marginal note in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is by no means a matter of indifference; it is untrue, and therefore it is mischievous.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I rather differ on the rank, under a classificatory point of view, which you assign to man; I do not think any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> simply in excess ought ever to be used for the higher divisions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred to me that much may be due to the correlation of complexion (and consequently hair) with constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) At the same time, there is so much evidence of migrations and displacements of races of man, and so many cases of peoples of distinct physical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s inhabiting the same or similar regions, and also of races of uniform physical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s inhabiting widely dissimilar regions,--that the external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of the chief races of man must, I think, be older than his present geographical distribution, and the modifications produced by correlation to favourable variations of constitution be only a secondary cause of external modification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the constant battles of savages leading to selection of physical superiority, I think it would be very imperfect and subject to so many exceptions and irregularities that it would produce no definite result.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It could lead, therefore, to no differential <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, but merely to the keeping up of a certain average standard of bodily and mental health and vigour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the rank of man in zoological classification, I fear I have not made myself intelligible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It has given me great pleasure to find that there are symptoms of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in your health.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The point on which I want information is in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to any part which may be fairly called rudimentary in comparison with the same part in the Quadrumana or any other mammal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Are there any other glands or other organs which you can think of? I know I have no right whatever to ask all these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, and can only say that I should be grateful for any information.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I do not know whether you would <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to possess a copy, but I told my publisher to send you a copy of the new edition of the "Origin" last month.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, however, there should be, perhaps you will let me have a brief note from you, and if I do not hear I will <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> there is nothing in the notion.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This might possibly be worth <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galton proposes that "Some society should undertake three scientific <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s: the first, by means of a moderate number of influential local agencies, to institute continuous enquiries into the facts of human heredity; the second to be a centre of information on heredity for breeders of animals and plants; and the third to discuss and classify the facts that were collected" (loc.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I attended <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to the mental development of my young children, and with two, or as I believe three of them, soon after they had come to the age when they knew the names of all common objects, I was startled by observing that they seemed quite incapable of affixing the right names to the colours in coloured engravings, although I tried repeatedly to teach them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter seems to me one of the richest of all the mines, and is worth working <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully for years, and very deeply.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This knowledge would probably give a foundation for some <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in our education of young children, and would show us whether the system ought to be followed in all cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I will venture to specify a few points of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> which, as it seems to me, possess some scientific interest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, does the education of the parents influence the mental powers of their children at any age, either at a very early or somewhat more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d stage? This could perhaps be learned by schoolmasters and mistresses if a large number of children were first classed according to age and their mental attainments, and afterwards in accordance with the education of their parents, as far as this could be discovered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As observation is one of the earliest faculties developed in young children, and as this power would probably be exercised in an equal degree by the children of educated and uneducated persons, it seems not impossible that any transmitted effect from education could be displayed only at a somewhat <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would be desirable to test statistically, in a similar manner, the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the oft-repeated statement that coloured children at first learn as quickly as white children, but that they afterwards fall off in progress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is well known that children sometimes exhibit, at a very early age, strong special tastes, for which no cause can be assigned, although occasionally they may be accounted for by reversion to the taste or occupation of some progenitor; and it would be interesting to learn how far such early tastes are persistent and influence the future <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er of the individual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will mention one other small point of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> in relation to very young children, which may possibly prove important with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of language; but it could be investigated only by persons possessing an accurate musical ear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I fear that this letter can be of no use to you, but it will serve to show my <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and good wishes in your researches.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett does not seem to have supplied any information on the point in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This would be of great <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance to me, if you would have the kindness thus to aid me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I am much obliged for your note, and shall be truly obliged if you will insert any <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> on the subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(pages 89, 101) do not directly bear on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of protection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In your paper perhaps you will just allude to my scanty remark in the fourth edition, because in my Essay on Man I intend to discuss the whole subject of sexual selection, explaining as I believe it does much with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The female is more brightly coloured than the male, and has a convoluted trachea, elsewhere a masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There seems some reason to suppose that "the male undertakes the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of incubation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>") With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to certain female birds being more brightly coloured than the males, and the latter incubating, I have gone a little into the subject, and cannot say that I am fully satisfied.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a proof how little <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> I had made on the subject, I may mention that though I had been collecting facts on the colouring, and other sexual differences in mammals, your explanation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the females had not occurred to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have begun my discussion on sexual selection by showing that new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s often appear in one sex and are transmitted to that sex alone, and that from some unknown cause such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s apparently appear oftener in the male than in the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondly, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s may be developed and be confined to the male, and long afterwards be transferred to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Thirdly, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s may arise in either sex and be transmitted to both sexes, either in an equal or unequal degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the absence of spurs in the female gallinaceous birds, I presume that they would be in the way during incubation; at least I have got the case of a German breed of fowls in which the hens were spurred, and were found to disturb and break their eggs much.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the females of deer not having horns, I presume it is to save the loss of organised matter.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> I see that I must trust to analogy (an unsafe support) for sexual selection in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to colour in butterflies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Your facts are all the more valuable as I now clearly see that for butterflies I must trust to analogy altogether in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The fertility of hybrid canaries would be a fine subject for <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful investigation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to one of these papers Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondly, do you suppose that the birds which pair first in the season have any advantage in rearing numerous and healthy offspring over those which pair later in the season? With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the mysterious cases of which you have given me so many, in addition to those previously collected, of when one bird of a pair is shot another immediately supplying its place, I was drawing to the conclusion that there must be in each district several unpaired birds; yet this seems very improbable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You allude, also, to the unknown causes which keep down the numbers of birds; and often and often have I <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>led over this subject with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to many animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You do not lay much or any stress on new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s spontaneously appearing in one sex (generally the male), and being transmitted exclusively, or more commonly only in excess, to that sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had only a glimpse of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>; but even now I do not go quite as far as you.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Is the scar on your son's leg on the same side and on exactly the same spot where you were wounded? And did the wound suppurate, or heal by the first intention?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> I sometimes <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> how <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> progresses, so difficult is it for one man to convince another, unless his mind is vacant.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Can the name Heterocentron have any reference to such diversity? Would it be asking too great a favour to ask you to look at dried specimens of Heterocentron roseum (which would be best), or of Monochoetum, or any eight-stamened Melastomad, of which you have specimens from several localities (as this would ensure specimens having been taken from distinct plants), and observe whether the pistil bends differently or stamens differently in different plants?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I always supposed until lately that no evil effects would be visible until after several generations of self-fertilisation, but now I see that one generation sometimes suffices, and the existence of dimorphic plants and all the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful contrivances of orchids are quite intelligible to me.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is very true what you say about unimportant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being so important systematically; yet it is hardly paradoxical bearing in mind that the natural system is genetic, and that we have to discover the genealogies anyhow.</li>
