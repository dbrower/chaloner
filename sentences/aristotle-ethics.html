<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the two works taken together we have their author's whole theory of human conduct or practical activity, that is, of all human activity which is not directed merely to knowledge or <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor do these titles suggest any very compact unity in the works to which they are applied: the plural forms, which survive so oddly in English (Ethic_s_, Politic_s_), were intended to indicate the treatment within a single work of a _group_ of connected <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The unity of the first group arises from their centring round the topic of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, that of the second from their connection with the existence and life of the city or state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have thus to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the _Ethics_ as dealing with one group of problems and the _Politics_ with a second, both falling within the wide compass of Political Science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> So viewing him he has studied the nature and formation of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>--all that he can make himself or be made by others to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Especially he has investigated the various admirable forms of human <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and the mode of their production.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By itself it does not enable us to become, or to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> others to become, good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_, a treatise devoted to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which centre round the enquiry; by what organisation of social or political forces, by what laws or institutions can we best secure the greatest amount of good <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>?  We must, however, remember that the production of good <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is not the end of either individual or state action: that is the aim of the one and the other because good <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is the indispensable condition and chief determinant of happiness, itself the goal of all human doing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence the _Ethics_, where his attention is directed upon the formation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, is largely and centrally a treatise on Moral Education.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet "the rest" is not irrelevant; the whole situation in which <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> grows and operates is concretely conceived.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is a basis of what we should call Psychology, sketched in firm outlines, the deeper presuppositions and the wider issues of human <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and conduct are not ignored, and there is no little of what we should call Metaphysics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seizes and dwells upon those elements and features in human practice which are most essential and permanent, and it is small <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that so much in it survives in our own ways of <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing conduct and speaking of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of such knowledge that it should be deficient in "exactness," in <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong> of statement, and closeness of logical concatenation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moral experience--the actual possession and exercise of good <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>--is necessary truly to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> moral principles and profitably to apply them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If the discussion of the nature and formation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the central topic of the _Ethics_, the contents of Book I.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further it is always assumed that all human practical activity is directed or "oriented" to a _single_ end, and that that end is knowable or definable in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of its realisation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The presentation of the Moral Ideal as Duty is almost absent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He mixes up in an arbitrary way such ingredients as "not expecting more from life than it is capable of bestowing," "mental cultivation," "<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d laws," etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These last fall into two groups, which Aristotle distinguishes as Goodnesses of Intellect and Goodnesses of Character.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They have in common that they all excite in us admiration and praise of their possessors, and that they are not natural endowments, but acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics But they differ in important ways.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The latter constitute "<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>," each of them as a "moral virtue" (literally "a goodness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>"), and upon them primarily depends the realisation of happiness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Perhaps the truest way of conceiving Aristotle's meaning here is to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> a moral virtue as a form of obedience to a maxim or rule of conduct accepted by the agent as valid for a class of recurrent situations in human life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The "moral virtues and vices" make up what we call <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and the important <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s arise: (1) What is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>? and (2) How is it formed? (for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in this sense is not a natural endowment; it is formed or produced).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aristotle deals with these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in the reverse order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Character, good or bad, is produced by what Aristotle calls "habituation," that is, it is the result of the repeated doing of acts which have a similar or common quality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Hence the several acts which determine goodness or badness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> must be done in a certain way, and thus the formation of good <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> requires discipline and direction from without.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not that the agent himself contributes nothing to the formation of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but that at first he needs guidance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The result is a growing <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of what is done, a choice of it for its own sake, a fixity and steadiness of purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The repetition of acts which lie in the mean is the cause of the formation of each and every "goodness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>," and for this "rules" can be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the "Table of the Virtues and Vices," each of the virtues is flanked by two opposite vices, which are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the excess and defect of that which in due measure constitutes the virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Aristotle tries to show that this is the case in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to every virtue named and recognised as such, but his treatment is often forced and the endeavour is not very successful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Except as a convenient principle of arrangement of the various forms of praiseworthy or blameworthy <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, generally acknowledged as such by Greek opinion, this form of the doctrine is of no great significance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aristotle is here dealing with justice in a restricted sense viz as that special goodness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is required of every adult citizen and which can be produced by early discipline or habituation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence "distributive justice" is concerned not with the large <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the distribution of political power and privileges among the constituent members or classes of the state but with the smaller <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of the distribution among those of casual gains and even with the division among private claimants of a common fund or inheritance, while "corrective justice" is concerned solely with the management of legal redress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Book VI appears to have in view two aims: (1) to describe goodness of intellect and discover its highest form or forms; (2) to show how this is related to goodness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and so to conduct generally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The process presupposes _(a)_ a clear and just apprehension of the nature of that end--such as the _Ethics_ itself endeavours to supply; _(b)_ a correct perception of the conditions of action, _(a)_ at least is impossible except to a man whose <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has been duly formed by discipline; it arises only in a man who has acquired moral virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> For such action and feeling as forms bad <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, blinds the eye of the soul and corrupts the moral principle, and the place of practical wisdom is taken by that parody of itself which Aristotle calls "cleverness"--the "wisdom" of the unscrupulous man of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus true practical wisdom and true goodness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> are interdependent; neither is genuinely possible or "completely" present without the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> This is Aristotle's contribution to the discussion of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, so central in Greek Moral Philosophy, of the relation of the intellectual and the passionate factors in conduct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Aristotle is not an intuitionist, but he recognises the implication in conduct of a direct and immediate apprehension both of the end and of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his circumstances under which it is from moment to moment realised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This condition was to the Greeks a matter of only too frequent experience, but it appeared to them peculiarly difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>we return to the topic of Pleasure, which is now <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed from a different point of view.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Answers are given both to the psychological <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, "What is Pleasure?" and to the ethical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, "What is its value?" Pleasure, we are told, is the natural concomitant and index of perfect activity, distinguishable but inseparable from it--"the activity of a subject at its best acting upon an object at its best.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But on what sort of life is such activity possible? This leads us back to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, What is happiness? In what life can man find the fullest satisfaction for his desires? To this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> Aristotle gives an answer which cannot but surprise us after what has preceded.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In spite of the almost religious fervour with which he speaks of it ("the most orthodox of his disciples" paraphrases his meaning by describing its content as "the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> and vision of God"), it is clear that he identified it with the life of the philosopher, as he understood it, a life of ceaseless intellectual activity in which at least at times all the distractions and disturbances inseparable from practical life seemed to disappear and become as nothing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The nobility of this ideal cannot be <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed; the conception of the end of man or a life lived for <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>--of a life blissfully absorbed in the vision of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>--is a lofty and inspiring one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But we cannot resist certain criticisms upon its presentation by Aristotle: (1) the relation of it to the lower ideal of practice is left somewhat obscure; (2) it is described in such a way as renders its realisation possible only to a gifted few, and under exceptional circumstances; (3) it seems in various ways, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s its content, to be unnecessarily and unjustifiably limited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> The richness and variety of this Ideal ceaselessly invite, but as ceaselessly defy, our attempts to imprison it in a definite formula or portray it in detailed <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This conception of the best life is not forgotten in the _Politics_ The end of life in the state is itself well-living and well-doing--a life which <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s to produce the best life The great agency in the production of such life is the State operating through Law, which is Reason backed by Force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finding in his predecessors no developed doctrine on this subject, Aristotle proposes himself to undertake the construction of it, and sketches in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the programme of the _Politics_ in the concluding sentence of the _Ethics_ His ultimate object is to answer the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, What is the best form of Polity, how should each be constituted, and what laws and customs should it adopt and employ? Not till this answer is given will "the philosophy of human affairs" be complete.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  On looking back it will be seen that the discussion of the central topic of the nature and formation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has expanded into a Philosophy of Human Conduct, merging at its beginning and end into metaphysics The result is a Moral Philosophy set against a background of Political Theory and general Philosophy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic features of this Moral Philosophy are due to the fact of its essentially teleological view of human life and action: (1) Every human activity, but especially every human practical activity, is directed towards a simple End discoverable by reflection, and this End is conceived of as the object of universal human desire, as something to be enjoyed, not as something which ought to be done or enacted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anstotle's Moral Philosophy is not hedonistic but it is eudæmomstic, the end is the enjoyment of Happiness, not the fulfilment of Duty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This view has the great advantage of exhibiting morality as essentially reasonable, but the accompanying disadvantage of lowering it into a somewhat prosaic and unideal Prudentialism, nor is it saved from this by the tacking on to it, by a sort of after-thought, of the second and higher Ideal--an addition which ruins the coherence of the account without really transmuting its substance The source of our dissatisfaction with the whole theory lies deeper than in its tendency to identify the end with the maximum of enjoyment or satisfaction, or to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the goodness or badness of acts and feelings as lying solely in their efficacy to produce such a result It arises from the application to morality of the distinction of means and end For this distinction, for all its plausibility and usefulness in ordinary thought and speech, cannot finally be maintained In morality--and this is vital to its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>--everything is both means and end, and so neither in distinction or separation, and all thinking about it which presupposes the finality of this distinction wanders into misconception and error.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, since actions and arts and sciences are many, the Ends likewise come to be many: of the healing art, for instance, health; of the ship-building art, a vessel; of the military art, victory; and of domestic management, wealth; are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the Ends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again; we see also ranging under this the most highly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed faculties, such as the art military, and that of domestic management, and Rhetoric.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We must be content then, in speaking of such things and from such data, to set forth the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> roughly and in outline; in other words, since we are speaking of general matter and from general data, to draw also conclusions merely general.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And I draw no distinction between young in years, and youthful in temper and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>: the defect to which I allude being no direct result of the time, but of living at the beck and call of passion, and following each object as it rises.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now the many are plainly quite slavish, choosing a life like that of brute animals: yet they obtain some <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, because many of the great share the tastes of Sardanapalus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, one would be much more inclined to think this to be the end of the life in society; yet this itself is plainly not sufficiently final: for it is conceived possible, that a man possessed of virtue might sleep or be inactive all through his life, or, as a third case, suffer the greatest evils and misfortunes: and the man who should live thus no one would call happy, except for mere disputation's sake.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: VI] Again, the notion of one Universal Good (the same, that is, in all things), it is better perhaps we should examine, and discuss the meaning of it, though such an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> is unpleasant, because they are friends of ours who have introduced these [Greek: _eidae_].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still perhaps it may appear better, nay to be our <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> where the safety of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is concerned, to upset if need be even our own theories, specially as we are lovers of wisdom: for since both are dear to us, we are bound to prefer the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now there is plainly a loophole to object to what has been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, on the plea that the theory I have attacked is not by its advocates applied to all good: but those goods only are spoken of as being under one [Greek: idea], which are pursued, and with which men rest content simply for their own sakes: whereas those things which have a tendency to produce or preserve them in any way, or to hinder their contraries, are called good because of these other goods, and after another fashion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> next arises, what kind of goods are we to call independent? All such as are pursued even when separated from other goods, as, for instance, being wise, seeing, and certain pleasures and honours (for these, though we do pursue them with some further end in view, one would still place among the independent goods)? or does it come in fact to this, that we can call nothing independent good except the [Greek: idea], and so the concrete of it will be nought?  If, on the other hand, these are independent goods, then we shall require that the account of the goodness be the same clearly in all, just as that of the whiteness is in snow and white lead.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But then, how does the name come to be common (for it is not seemingly a case of fortuitous equivocation)? Are different individual things called good by virtue of being from one source, or all conducing to one end, or rather by way of analogy, for that intellect is to the soul as sight to the body, and so on? However, perhaps we ought to leave these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s now, for an accurate investigation of them is more properly the business of a different philosophy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And likewise <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the [Greek: idea]: for even if there is some one good predicated in common of all things that are good, or separable and capable of existing independently, manifestly it cannot be the object of human action or attainable by Man; but we are in search now of something that is so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Some plausibility, it is true, this argument possesses, but it is contradicted by the facts of the Arts and Sciences; for all these, though aiming at some good, and seeking that which is deficient, yet pretermit the knowledge of it: now it is not exactly probable that all artisans without exception should be ignorant of so great a <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> as this would be, and not even look after it; neither is it easy to see wherein a weaver or a carpenter will be profited in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of his craft by knowing the very-good, or how a man will be the more apt to effect cures or to command an army for having seen the [Greek: idea] itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And it would seem that any man may <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> and connect what is good in the sketch, and that time is a good discoverer and co-operator in such matters: it is thus in fact that all <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments in the various arts have been brought about, for any man may fill up a deficiency.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The carpenter and geometrician, for instance, inquire into the right line in different fashion: the former so far as he wants it for his work, the latter inquires into its nature and properties, because he is concerned with the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And we must try to trace up each in their own nature, and take pains to secure their being well defined, because they have great influence on what follows: it is thought, I mean, that the starting-point or principle is more than half the whole matter, and that many of the points of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> come simultaneously into view thereby.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now there is a common division of goods into three classes; one being called external, the other two those of the soul and body <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, and those belonging to the soul we call most properly and specially good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now in the case of the multitude of men the things which they individually <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> pleasant clash, because they are not such by nature, whereas to the lovers of nobleness those things are pleasant which are such by nature: but the actions in accordance with virtue are of this kind, so that they are pleasant both to the individuals and also in themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And hence too a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is raised, whether it is a thing that can be learned, or acquired by habituation or discipline of some other kind, or whether it comes in the way of divine dispensation, or even in the way of chance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this, it may be, is a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> belonging more properly to an investigation different from ours: and it is quite clear, that on the supposition of its not being sent from the Gods direct, but coming to us by reason of virtue and learning of a certain kind, or discipline, it is yet one of the most Godlike things; because the prize and End of virtue is manifestly somewhat most excellent, nay divine and blessed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be determined also by a reference to our definition of Happiness, that it is a working of the soul in the way of excellence or virtue of a certain kind: and of the other goods, some we must have to begin with, and those which are co-operative and useful are given by nature as instruments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  These <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s will harmonise also with what we said at the commencement: for we assumed the End of [Greek Text: poletikae] to be most excellent: now this bestows most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> on making the members of the community of a certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; good that is and apt to do what is honourable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But we must revert to the point first raised, since the present <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> will be easily determined from that.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If then we are to look to the end and then pronounce the man blessed, not as being so but as having been so at some previous time, surely it is absurd that when he _is_ happy the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is not to be asserted of him, because we are unwilling to pronounce the living happy by reason of their liability to changes, and because, whereas we have conceived of happiness as something stable and no way easily changeable, the fact is that good and bad fortune are constantly circling about the same people: for it is quite plain, that if we are to depend upon the fortunes of men, we shall often have to call the same man happy, and a little while after miserable, thus representing our happy man  "Chameleon-like, and based on rottenness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And, by the way, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which has been here discussed, testifies incidentally to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of our account of Happiness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And if, as we have said, the acts of working are what determine the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the life, no one of the blessed can ever become wretched, because he will never do those things which are hateful and mean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Nor, in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, is he shifting and easily changeable, for on the one hand from his happiness he will not be shaken easily nor by ordinary mischances, but, if at all, by those which are great and numerous; and, on the other, after such mischances he cannot regain his happiness in a little time; but, if at all, in a long and complete period, during which he has made himself master of great and noble things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If then, as of the misfortunes which happen to one's self, some have a certain weight and turn the balance of life, while others are, so to speak, lighter; so it is likewise with those which befall all our friends alike; if further, whether they whom each suffering befalls be alive or dead makes much more difference than in a tragedy the presupposing or actual perpetration of the various crimes and horrors, we must take into our account this difference also, and still more perhaps the doubt concerning the dead whether they really partake of any good or evil; it seems to result from all these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, that if anything does pierce the veil and reach them, be the same good or bad, it must be something trivial and small, either in itself or to them; or at least of such a magnitude or such a kind as neither to make happy them that are not so otherwise, nor to deprive of their blessedness them that are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   XII  Having determined these points, let us examine with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Happiness, whether it belongs to the class of things praiseworthy or things precious; for to that of faculties it evidently does not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in like manner in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of goods; no man thinks of praising Happiness as he does the principle of justice, but calls it blessed, as being somewhat more godlike and more excellent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Eudoxus too is thought to have <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d a sound argument in support of the claim of pleasure to the highest prize: for the fact that, though it is one of the good things, it is not praised, he took for an indication of its superiority to those which are subjects of praise: a superiority he attributed also to a god and the Chief Good, on the ground that they form the standard to which everything besides is referred.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) But if this investigation belongs properly to [Greek: politikae], then clearly the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> will be in accordance with our original design.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  So then the statesman is to consider the nature of the Soul: but he must do so with these objects in view, and so far only as may suffice for the objects of his special <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>: for to carry his speculations to a greater exactness is perhaps a task more laborious than falls within his province.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  In fact, the few statements made on the subject in my popular treatises are quite enough, and accordingly we will adopt them here: as, that the Soul consists of two parts, the Irrational and the Rational (as to whether these are actually divided, as are the parts of the body, and everything that is capable of division; or are only metaphysically speaking two, being by nature inseparable, as are convex and concave circumferences, matters not in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of our present purpose).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If then we are to say that this also has Reason, then the Rational, as well as the Irrational, will be twofold, the one supremely and in itself, the other paying it a kind of filial <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Excellence of Man then is divided in accordance with this difference: we make two classes, calling the one Intellectual, and the other Moral; pure science, intelligence, and practical wisdom--Intellectual: liberality, and perfected self-mastery--Moral: in speaking of a man's Moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, we do not say he is a scientific or intelligent but a meek man, or one of perfected self-mastery: and we praise the man of science in right of his mental state; and of these such as are praiseworthy we call Excellences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this testimony is borne by what takes place in communities: because the law-givers make the individual members good men by habituation, and this is the intention certainly of every law-giver, and all who do not effect it well fail of their intent; and herein consists the difference between a good Constitution and a bad.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Similarly is it also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the occasions of lust and anger: for some men come to be perfected in self-mastery and mild, others destitute of all self-control and passionate; the one class by behaving in one way under them, the other by behaving in another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Or, in one word, the habits are produced from the acts of working like to them: and so what we have to do is to give a certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to these particular acts, because the habits formed correspond to the differences of these.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, to quote what we said before: every habit of the Soul by its very nature has relation to, and exerts itself upon, things of the same kind as those by which it is naturally deteriorated or <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d: now such habits do come to be vicious by reason of pleasures and pains, that is, by men pursuing or avoiding <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, either such as they ought not, or at wrong times, or in wrong manner, and so forth (for which reason, by the way, some people define the Virtues as certain states of impassibility and utter quietude, but they are wrong because they speak without modification, instead of adding "as they ought," "as they ought not," and "when," and so on).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s may also serve to set this in a clear light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are principally three things moving us to choice and three to avoidance, the honourable, the expedient, the pleasant; and their three contraries, the dishonourable, the hurtful, and the painful: now the good man is apt to go right, and the bad man wrong, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all these of course, but most specially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pleasure: because not only is this common to him with all animals but also it is a concomitant of all those things which move to choice, since both the honourable and the expedient give an impression of pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, we adopt pleasure and pain (some of us more, and some less) as the measure even of actions: for this cause then our whole business must be with them, since to receive right or wrong impressions of pleasure and pain is a thing of no little importance in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the actions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Once more; it is harder, as Heraclitus says, to fight against pleasure than against anger: now it is about that which is more than commonly difficult that art comes into being, and virtue too, because in that which is difficult the good is of a higher order: and so for this reason too both virtue and moral philosophy generally must wholly busy themselves <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing pleasures and pains, because he that uses these well will be good, he that does so ill will be bad.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now I can conceive a person perplexed as to the meaning of our statement, that men must do just actions to become just, and those of self-mastery to acquire the habit of self-mastery; "for," he would say, "if men are doing the actions they have the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive virtues already, just as men are grammarians or musicians when they do the actions of either art.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet people in general do not perform these actions, but taking refuge in talk they flatter themselves they are philosophising, and that they will so be good men: acting in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> very like those sick people who listen to the doctor with great attention but do nothing that he tells them: just as these then cannot be well bodily under such a course of treatment, so neither can those be mentally by such philosophising.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  By Feelings, I mean such as lust, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, friendship, hatred, longing, emulation, <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>, in short all such as are followed by pleasure or pain: by Capacities, those in right of which we are said to be capable of these feelings; as by virtue of which we are able to have been made angry, or grieved, or to have <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>ated; by States, those in right of which we are in a certain relation good or bad to the aforementioned feelings; to having been made angry, for instance, we are in a wrong relation if in our anger we were too violent or too slack, but if we were in the happy medium we are in a right relation to the feeling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now how this shall be it is true we have said already, but still perhaps it may throw light on the subject to see what is its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ Virtue, of course which I mean, because this it is which is concerned with feelings and actions, and in these there can be excess and defect and the mean: it is possible, for instance, to feel the emotions of fear, confidence, lust, anger, <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>, and pleasure and pain generally, too much or too little, and in either case wrongly; but to feel them when we ought, on what occasions, towards whom, why, and as, we should do, is the mean, or in other words the best state, and this is the property of Virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  In like manner too with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the actions, there may be excess and defect and the mean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And so, viewing it in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of its essence and definition, Virtue is a mean state; but in reference to the chief good and to excellence it is the highest state possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  You might as well require that there should be determined a mean state, an excess and a defect in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of acting unjustly, being cowardly, or giving up all control of the passions: for at this rate there will be of excess and defect a mean state; of excess, excess; and of defect, defect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of fears and confidence or boldness:  [Sidenote: 1107b]  The Mean state is Courage: men may exceed, of course, either in absence of fear or in positive confidence: the former has no name (which is a common case), the latter is called rash: again, the man who has too much fear and too little confidence is called a coward.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of pleasures and pains (but not all, and perhaps fewer pains than pleasures):  The Mean state here is perfected Self-Mastery, the defect total absence of Self-control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As for defect in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of pleasure, there are really no people who are chargeable with it, so, of course, there is really no name for such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, but, as they are conceivable, we will give them one and call them insensible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of giving and taking wealth (a):  The mean state is Liberality, the excess Prodigality, the defect Stinginess: here each of the extremes involves really an excess and defect contrary to each other: I mean, the prodigal gives out too much and takes in too little, while the stingy man takes in too much and gives out too little.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of wealth (b):  There are other <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s besides these just mentioned; a mean state called Munificence (for the munificent man differs from the liberal, the former having necessarily to do with great wealth, the latter with but small); the excess called by the names either of Want of taste or Vulgar Profusion, and the defect Paltriness (these also differ from the extremes connected with liberality, and the manner of their difference shall also be spoken of later).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of honour and dishonour (a):  The mean state Greatness of Soul, the excess which may be called braggadocio, and the defect Littleness of Soul.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of honour and dishonour (b):  [Sidenote: 1108a]  Now there is a state bearing the same relation to Greatness of Soul as we said just now Liberality does to Munificence, with the difference that is of being about a small amount of the same thing: this state having reference to small honour, as Greatness of Soul to great honour; a man may, of course, grasp at honour either more than he should or less; now he that exceeds in his grasping at it is called ambitious, he that falls short unambitious, he that is just as he should be has no proper name: nor in fact have the states, except that the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the ambitious man is called ambition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For this reason those who are in either extreme lay claim to the mean as a debateable land, and we call the virtuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> sometimes by the name ambitious, sometimes by that of unambitious, and we commend sometimes the one and sometimes the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of anger:  Here too there is excess, defect, and a mean state; but since they may be said to have really no proper names, as we call the virtuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> Meek, we will call the mean state Meekness, and of the extremes, let the man who is excessive be denominated Passionate, and the faulty state Passionateness, and him who is deficient Angerless, and the defect Angerlessness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There are also three other mean states, having some mutual resemblance, but still with differences; they are alike in that they all have for their object-matter intercourse of words and deeds, and they differ in that one has <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> herein, the other two to what is pleasant; and this in two ways, the one in relaxation and amusement, the other in all things which occur in daily life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>: The man who is in the mean state we will call Truthful, and his state Truthfulness, and as to the disguise of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, if it be on the side of exaggeration, Braggadocia, and him that has it a Braggadocio; if on that of diminution, Reserve and Reserved shall be the terms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of what is pleasant in the way of relaxation or amusement: The mean state shall be called Easy-pleasantry, and the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> accordingly a man of Easy-pleasantry; the excess Buffoonery, and the man a Buffoon; the man deficient herein a Clown, and his state Clownishness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of what is pleasant in daily life: He that is as he should be may be called Friendly, and his mean state Friendliness: he that exceeds, if it be without any interested motive, somewhat too Complaisant, if with such motive, a Flatterer: he that is deficient and in all instances unpleasant, Quarrelsome and Cross.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ who has no shame at all in his composition, is called Shameless: but the right <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> Shamefaced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Indignation against successful vice, again, is a state in the mean between Envy and Malevolence: they all three have <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pleasure and pain produced by what happens to one's neighbour: for the man who has this right feeling is annoyed at undeserved success of others, while the envious man goes beyond him and is annoyed at all success of others, and the malevolent falls so far short of feeling annoyance that he even rejoices [at misfortune of others].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So after this we will go accurately into each and say how they are mean states: and in like manner also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Intellectual Excellences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And so the extreme <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s push away, so to speak, towards each other the man in the mean state; the brave man is called a rash man by the coward, and a coward by the rash man, and in the other cases accordingly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Therefore he who aims at the mean should make it his first <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to keep away from that extreme which is more contrary than the other to the mean; just as Calypso in Homer advises Ulysses,  "Clear of this smoke and surge thy barque direct;"  because of the two extremes the one is always more, and the other less, erroneous; and, therefore, since to hit exactly on the mean is difficult, one must take the least of the evils as the safest plan; and this a man will be doing, if he follows this method.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1109b] We ought also to take into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> our own natural bias; which varies in each man's case, and will be ascertained from the pleasure and pain arising in us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But in all cases we must guard most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully against what is pleasant, and pleasure itself, because we are not <strong style='color: red'>impartial</strong> judges of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to what point or degree a man must err in order to incur blame, it is not easy to determine exactly in words: nor in fact any of those points which are matter of perception by the Moral Sense: such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s are matters of detail, and the decision of them rests with the Moral Sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>     BOOK III  I Now since Virtue is concerned with the regulation of feelings and actions, and praise and blame arise upon such as are voluntary, while for the involuntary allowance is made, and sometimes <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong> is excited, it is perhaps a necessary task for those who are investigating the nature of Virtue to draw out the distinction between what is voluntary and what involuntary; and it is certainly useful for legislators, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the assigning of honours and punishments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But when actions are done, either from fear of greater evils, or from some honourable motive, as, for instance, if you were ordered to commit some base act by a despot who had your parents or children in his power, and they were to be saved upon your compliance or die upon your refusal, in such cases there is room for a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the actions are voluntary or involuntary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  A similar <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> arises with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to cases of throwing goods overboard in a storm: abstractedly no man throws away his property willingly, but with a view to his own and his shipmates' safety any one would who had any sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is, such actions are of a mixed kind, but are most like voluntary actions; for they are choiceworthy at the time when they are being done, and the end or object of the action must be taken with reference to the actual occasion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1111a] Again, we do not usually apply the term involuntary when a man is ignorant of his own true interest; because ignorance which affects moral choice constitutes depravity but not involuntariness: nor does any ignorance of principle (because for this men are blamed) but ignorance in particular details, wherein consists the action and wherewith it is concerned, for in these there is both <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong> and allowance, because he who acts in ignorance of any of them acts in a proper sense involuntarily.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>who acts, what he is doing, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to what or in what, sometimes with what, as with what instrument, and with what result (as that of preservation, for instance), and how, as whether softly or violently.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what he is doing a man may be ignorant, as men in speaking say a thing escaped them unawares; or as Aeschylus did with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Mysteries, that he was not aware that it was unlawful to speak of them; or as in the case of that catapult accident the other day the man said he discharged it merely to display its operation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now since ignorance is possible in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all these details in which the action consists, he that acted in ignorance of any of them is thought to have acted involuntarily, and he most so who was in ignorance as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the most important, which are thought to be those in which the action consists, and the result.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then as to the former, it is a strange thing to maintain actions to be involuntary which we are bound to grasp at: now there are occasions on which anger is a <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, and there are things which we are bound to lust after, health, for instance, and learning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  II  Having thus drawn out the distinction between voluntary and involuntary action our next step is to examine into the nature of Moral Choice, because this seems most intimately connected with Virtue and to be a more decisive test of moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than a man's acts are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  However, nobody perhaps maintains its identity with Opinion simply; but it is not the same with opinion of any kind, because by choosing good and bad things we are constituted of a certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but by having opinions on them we are not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, we choose to take or avoid, and so on, but we opine what a thing is, or for what it is <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, or how; but we do not opine to take or avoid.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Further, Moral Choice is commended rather for having a right object than for being judicious, but Opinion for being formed in accordance with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, we choose such things as we pretty well know to be good, but we form opinions <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing such as we do not know at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It may be urged, that Opinion always precedes or accompanies Moral Choice; be it so, this makes no difference, for this is not the point in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, but whether Moral Choice is the same as Opinion of a certain kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Since then it is none of the aforementioned things, what is it, or how is it <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised? Voluntary it plainly is, but not all voluntary action is an object of Moral Choice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"   III  Well then; do men deliberate about everything, and is anything soever the object of Deliberation, or are there some matters with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to which there is none? (It may be as well perhaps to say, that by "object of Deliberation" is meant such matter as a sensible man would deliberate upon, not what any fool or madman might.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But we do deliberate <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing such practical matters as are in our own power (which are what are left after all our exclusions).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1112b] Again, we do not deliberate <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing such arts or sciences as are exact and independent: as, for instance, about written <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, because we have no doubt how they should be formed; but we do deliberate on all buch things as are usually done through our own instrumentality, but not invariably in the same way; as, for instance, about matters connected with the healing art, or with money-making; and, again, more about piloting ships than gymnastic exercises, because the former has been less exactly determined, and so forth; and more about arts than sciences, because we more frequently doubt <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the former.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  [Sidenote: IV] That Wish has for its object-matter the End, has been already stated; but there are two opinions <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing it; some thinking that its object is real good, others whatever impresses the mind with a notion of good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But, if these opinions do not satisfy us, may we not say that, abstractedly and as a matter of objective <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, the really good is the object of Wish, but to each individual whatever impresses his mind with the notion of good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  For there are fair and pleasant things peculiar to, and so varying with, each state; and perhaps the most distinguishing <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the good man is his seeing the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in every instance, he being, in fact, the rule and measure of these matters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now since the End is the object of Wish, and the means to the End of Deliberation and Moral Choice, the actions <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing these matters must be in the way of Moral Choice, _i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But if it is in our power to do and to forbear doing what is creditable or the contrary, and these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively constitute the being good or bad, then the being good or vicious <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s is in our power.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And what makes the case stronger is this: that they chastise for the very fact of ignorance, when it is thought to be self-caused; to the drunken, for instance, penalties are double, because the origination in such case lies in a man's own self: for he might have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed getting drunk, and this is the cause of his ignorance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But perhaps a man is of such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that he cannot attend to such things: still men are themselves the causes of having become such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by living <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessly, and also of being unjust or destitute of self-control, the former by doing evil actions, the latter by spending their time in drinking and such-like; because the particular acts of working form corresponding <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as is shown by those who are practising for any contest or particular course of action, for such men persevere in the acts of working.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For, to take the analogous case, the sick man cannot with a wish be well again, yet in a supposable case he is voluntarily ill because he has produced his sickness by living intemperately and dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing his physicians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There was a time then when he might have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed being ill, but now he has let himself go he cannot any longer; just as he who has let a stone out of his hand cannot recall it, and yet it rested with him to aim and throw it, because the origination was in his power.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Just so the unjust man, and he who has lost all self-control, might originally have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed being what they are, and so they are voluntarily what they are; but now that they are become so they no longer have the power of being otherwise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And not only are mental diseases voluntary, but the bodily are so in some men, whom we accordingly blame: for such as are naturally deformed no one blames, only such as are so by reason of want of exercise, and neglect: and so too of weakness and maiming: no one would think of upbraiding, but would rather <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>ate, a man who is blind by nature, or from disease, or from an accident; but every one would blame him who was so from excess of wine, or any other kind of intemperance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> It seems, then, that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of bodily diseases, those which depend on ourselves are censured, those which do not are not censured; and if so, then in the case of the mental disorders, those which are censured must depend upon ourselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: III4_b_] But suppose a man to say, "that (by our own admission) all men aim at that which conveys to their minds an impression of good, and that men have no control over this impression, but that the End impresses each with a notion correspondent to his own individual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; that to be sure if each man is in a way the cause of his own moral state, so he will be also of the kind of impression he receives: whereas, if this is not so, no one is the cause to himself of doing evil actions, but he does them by reason of ignorance of the true End, supposing that through their means he will secure the chief good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If then, as is commonly said, the Virtues are voluntary (because we at least co-operate in producing our moral states, and we assume the End to be of a certain kind according as we are ourselves of certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s), the Vices must be voluntary also, because the cases are exactly similar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well now, we have stated generally <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the Moral Virtues, the genus (in outline), that they are mean states, and that they are habits, and how they are formed, and that they are of themselves calculated to act upon the circumstances out of which they were formed, and that they are in our own power and voluntary, and are to be done so as right Reason may direct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Here we will resume the particular discussion of the Moral Virtues, and say what they are, what is their object-matter, and how they stand <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively related to it: of course their number will be thereby shown.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now that it is a mean state, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of fear and boldness, has been already said: further, the objects of our fears are obviously things fearful or, in a general way of statement, evils; which accounts for the common definition of fear, viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  Of course we fear evils of all kinds: disgrace, for instance, poverty, disease, desolateness, death; but not all these seem to be the object-matter of the Brave man, because there are things which to fear is right and noble, and not to fear is base; disgrace, for example, since he who fears this is a good man and has a sense of honour, and he who does not fear it is shameless (though there are those who call him Brave by analogy, because he somewhat resembles the Brave man who agrees with him in being free from fear); but poverty, perhaps, or disease, and in fact whatever does not proceed from viciousness, nor is attributable to his own fault, a man ought not to fear: still, being fearless in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of these would not constitute a man Brave in the proper sense of the term.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  He then may be most properly denominated Brave who is fearless in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of honourable death and such sudden emergencies as threaten death; now such specially are those which arise in the course of war.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1115b] It is not meant but that the Brave man will be fearless also on the sea (and in sickness), but not in the same way as sea-faring men; for these are light-hearted and hopeful by reason of their experience, while landsmen though Brave are apt to give themselves up for lost and shudder at the notion of such a death: to which it should be added that Courage is exerted in circumstances which admit of doing something to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> one's self, or in which death would be honourable; now neither of these requisites attach to destruction by drowning or sickness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So the errors come to be either that a man fears when he ought not to fear at all, or that he fears in an improper way, or at a wrong time, and so forth; and so too in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of things inspiring confidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He is Brave then who withstands, and fears, and is bold, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of right objects, from a right motive, in right manner, and at right times: since the Brave man suffers or acts as he ought and as right reason may direct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now the end of every separate act of working is that which accords with the habit, and so to the Brave man Courage; which is honourable; therefore such is also the End, since the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of each is determined by the End.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s on the side of Excess, he who exceeds in utter absence of fear has no appropriate name (I observed before that many states have none), but he would be a madman or inaccessible to pain if he feared nothing, neither earthquake, nor the billows, as they tell of the Celts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  He again who exceeds in confidence in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of things fearful is rash.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> He is thought moreover to be a braggart, and to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> unfounded claims to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Brave: the relation which the Brave man really bears to objects of fear this man wishes to appear to bear, and so imitates him in whatever points he can; for this reason most of them exhibit a curious mixture of rashness and cowardice; because, affecting rashness in these circumstances, they do not withstand what is truly fearful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  So the coward, the rash, and the Brave man have exactly the same object-matter, but stand differently related to it: the two first-mentioned <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively exceed and are deficient, the last is in a mean state and as he ought to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, as has been said, Courage is a mean state in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of objects inspiring boldness or fear, in the circumstances which have been stated, and the Brave man chooses his line and withstands danger either because to do so is honourable, or because not to do so is base.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   VIII  Courage proper is somewhat of the kind I have described, but there are <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s, differing in five ways, which also bear in common parlance the name of Courage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Such is the kind of Courage Homer exhibits in his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; Diomed and Hector for example.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then again by reason of their skill they are better able than any others to inflict without suffering themselves, because they are able to use their arms and have such as are most <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able both with a view to offence and defence: so that their case is parallel to that of armed men fighting with unarmed or trained athletes with amateurs, since in contests of this kind those are the best fighters, not who are the bravest men, but who are the strongest and are in the best condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So men also are pained by a feeling of anger, and take pleasure in revenge; but they who fight from these causes may be good fighters, but they are not truly Brave (in that they do not act from a sense of honour, nor as reason directs, but merely from the present feeling), still they bear some resemblance to that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are alike, however, in that both are confident; but then the Brave are so from the afore-mentioned causes, whereas these are so from a settled conviction of their being superior and not likely to suffer anything in return (they who are intoxicated do much the same, for they become hopeful when in that state); but when the event disappoints their expectations they run away: now it was said to be the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a Brave man to withstand things which are fearful to man or produce that impression, because it is honourable so to do and the contrary is dishonourable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But there is perhaps no reason why not such men should make the best soldiers, but those who are less truly Brave but have no other good to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for: these being ready to meet danger and bartering their lives against small gain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now men are not called perfectly self-mastering or wholly destitute of self-control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of pleasures of this class: nor in fact in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of any which are not bodily; those for example who love to tell long stories, and are prosy, and spend their days about mere chance matters, we call gossips but not wholly destitute of self-control, nor again those who are pained at the loss of money or friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  So too of objects perceived by the sense of Hearing; no one applies the terms before quoted <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively to those who are excessively pleased with musical tunes or acting, or to those who take such pleasure as they ought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Nor again to those persons whose pleasure arises from the sense of Smell, except incidentally: I mean, we do not say men have no self-control because they take pleasure in the scent of fruit, or flowers, or incense, but rather when they do so in the smells of unguents and sauces: since men destitute of self-control take pleasure herein, because hereby the objects of their lusts are recalled to their <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> (you may also see other men take pleasure in the smell of food when they are hungry): but to take pleasure in such is a mark of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> before named since these are objects of desire to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indeed it is brutish to take pleasure in such things and to like them best of all; for the most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able of the pleasures arising from the touch have been set aside; those, for instance, which occur in the course of gymnastic training from the rubbing and the warm bath: because the touch of the man destitute of self-control is not indifferently of _any_ part of the body but only of particular parts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For this reason these men are called belly-mad, as filling it beyond what they ought, and it is the slavish who become of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the peculiar pleasures many men go wrong and in many different ways; for whereas the term "fond of so and so" implies either taking pleasure in wrong objects, or taking pleasure excessively, or as the mass of men do, or in a wrong way, they who are destitute of all self-control exceed in all these ways; that is to say, they take pleasure in some things in which they ought not to do so (because they are properly objects of detestation), and in such as it is right to take pleasure in they do so more than they ought and as the mass of men do.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, that excess with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pleasures is absence of self-control, and blameworthy, is plain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  As for men who are defective on the side of pleasure, who take less pleasure in things than they ought, they are almost imaginary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, because such absence of sensual perception is not natural to man: for even the other animals distinguish between different kinds of food, and like some kinds and dislike others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact, could a man be found who takes no pleasure in anything and to whom all things are alike, he would be far from being human at all: there is no name for such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> because it is simply imaginary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But the man of Perfected Self-Mastery is in the mean with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to these objects: that is to say, he neither takes pleasure in the things which delight the vicious man, and in fact rather dislikes them, nor at all in improper objects; nor to any great degree in any object of the class; nor is he pained at their absence; nor does he desire them; or, if he does, only in moderation, and neither more than he ought, nor at improper times, and so forth; but such things as are conducive to health and good condition of body, being also pleasant, these he will grasp at in moderation and as he ought to do, and also such other pleasant things as do not hinder these objects, and are not unseemly or disproportionate to his means; because he that should grasp at such would be liking such pleasures more than is proper; but the man of Perfected Self-Mastery is not of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but regulates his desires by the dictates of right reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And again, pain deranges and spoils the natural <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of its victim, whereas pleasure has no such effect and is more voluntary and therefore more justly open to reproach.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is so also for the following reason; that it is easier to be inured by habit to resist the objects of pleasure, there being many things of this kind in life and the process of habituation being unaccompanied by danger; whereas the case is the reverse as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the objects of fear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Unless then the appetite be obedient and subjected to the governing principle it will become very great: for in the fool the grasping after what is pleasant is insatiable and undiscriminating; and every acting out of the desire increases the kindred habit, and if the desires are great and violent in degree they even expel Reason entirely; therefore they ought to be moderate and few, and in no <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to be opposed to Reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  In short, as the child ought to live with constant <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the orders of its educator, so should the appetitive principle with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to those of Reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now this is thought to be the mean state, having for its object-matter Wealth: I mean, the Liberal man is praised not in the circumstances of war, nor in those which constitute the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of perfected self-mastery, nor again in judicial decisions, but in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of giving and receiving Wealth, chiefly the former.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  Now the states of excess and defect in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> of Wealth are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively Prodigality and Stinginess: the latter of these terms we attach invariably to those who are over <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful about Wealth, but the former we apply sometimes with a complex notion; that is to say, we give the name to those who fail of self-control and spend money on the unrestrained gratification of their passions; and this is why they are thought to be most base, because they have many vices at once.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He uses each particular thing best who has the virtue to whose province it belongs: so that he will use Wealth best who has the virtue <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Wealth, that is to say, the Liberal man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so the giving to proper persons is more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Liberal man, than the receiving from proper quarters and forbearing to receive from the contrary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact generally, doing well by others is more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of virtue than being done well by, and doing things positively honourable than forbearing to do things dishonourable; and any one may see that the doing well by others and doing things positively honourable attaches to the act of giving, but to that of receiving only the being done well by or forbearing to do what is dishonourable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And the Liberal are liked almost best of all virtuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, because they are profitable to others, and this their profitableness consists in their giving.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither shall he be so [Sidenote:1120b] denominated who does it with pain: this being a sign that he would prefer his wealth to the honourable action, and this is no part of the Liberal man's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; neither will such an one receive from improper sources, because the so receiving is not <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of one who values not wealth: nor again will he be apt to ask, because one who does kindnesses to others does not usually receive them willingly; but from proper sources (his own property, for instance) he will receive, doing this not as honourable but as necessary, that he may have somewhat to give: neither will he be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less of his own, since it is his wish through these to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> others in need: nor will he give to chance people, that he may have wherewith to give to those to whom he ought, at right times, and on occasions when it is honourable so to do.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, it is a trait in the Liberal man's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> even to exceed very much in giving so as to leave too little for himself, it being <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of such an one not to have a thought of self.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet this happens reasonably enough; it is impossible he should have wealth who does not take any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to have it, just as in any similar case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since Liberality is a mean state in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the giving and receiving of wealth, the Liberal man will give and spend on proper objects, and in proper proportion, in great things and in small alike, and all this with pleasure to himself; also he will receive from right sources, and in right proportion: because, as the virtue is a mean state in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of both, he will do both as he ought, and, in fact, upon proper giving follows the correspondent receiving, while that which is not such is contrary to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Liberal man is also a good man to have for a partner in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of wealth: for he can easily be wronged, since he values not wealth, and is more vexed at not spending where he ought to have done so than at spending where he ought not, and he relishes not the maxim of Simonides.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have said already that Prodigality and Stinginess are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively states of excess and defect, and this in two things, giving and receiving (expenditure of course we class under giving).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So if he could be wrought upon by habituation in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, or change in any other way, he would be a real Liberal man, for he will give to those to whom he should, and will forbear to receive whence he ought not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is the reason too why he is thought not to be low in moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, because to exceed in giving and in forbearing to receive is no sign of badness or meanness, but only of folly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But most Prodigals, as has been said, combine with their other faults that of receiving from improper sources, and on this point are Stingy: and they become grasping, because they wish to spend and cannot do this easily, since their means soon run short and they are necessitated to get from some other quarter; and then again, because they <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> not for what is honourable, they receive recklessly, and from all sources indifferently, because they desire to give but <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> not how or whence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And for this reason their givings are not Liberal, inasmuch as they are not honourable, nor purely disinterested, nor done in right fashion; but they oftentimes make those rich who should be poor, and to those who are quiet <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able kind of people they will give nothing, but to flatterers, or those who subserve their pleasures in any way, they will give much.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Thus then the Prodigal, if unguided, slides into these faults; but if he could get <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> bestowed on him he might come to the mean and to what is right.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There are some people whose motive, either supposed or alleged, for keeping their property is this, that they may never be driven to do anything dishonourable: to this class belongs the skinflint, and every one of similar <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, so named from the excess of not-giving.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote:1122a] The other class again who are Stingy in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of receiving exceed in that they receive anything from any source; such as they who work at illiberal employments, brothel keepers, and such-like, and usurers who lend small sums at large interest: for all these receive from improper sources, and improper amounts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their common <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic is base-gaining, since they all submit to disgrace for the sake of gain and that small; because those who receive great things neither whence they ought, nor what they ought (as for instance despots who sack cities and plunder temples), we denominate wicked, impious, and unjust, but not Stingy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Let this be considered as what we have to say <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Liberality and the contrary vices.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  II  Next in order would seem to come a dissertation on Magnificence, this being thought to be, like liberality, a virtue having for its object-matter Wealth; but it does not, like that, extend to all transactions in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Wealth, but only applies to such as are expensive, and in these circumstances it exceeds liberality in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of magnitude, because it is (what the very name in Greek hints at) fitting expense on a large scale: this term is of course relative: I mean, the expenditure of equipping and commanding a trireme is not the same as that of giving a public spectacle: "fitting" of course also is relative to the individual, and the matter wherein and upon which he has to spend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The falling short of such a state is called Meanness, the exceeding it Vulgar Profusion, Want of Taste, and so on; which are faulty, not because they are on an excessive scale in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of right objects but, because they show off in improper objects, and in improper manner: of these we will speak presently.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are cases of expenditure which we call honourable, such as are dedicatory offerings to the gods, and the furnishing their temples, and sacrifices, and in like manner everything that has reference to the Deity, and all such public matters as are objects of honourable ambition, as when men think in any case that it is their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to furnish a chorus for the stage splendidly, or fit out and maintain a trireme, or give a general public feast.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now in all these, as has been already stated, <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> is had also to the rank and the means of the man who is doing them: because they should be proportionate to these, and befit not the work only but also the doer of the work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic also of the Magnificent man to furnish his house suitably to his wealth, for this also in a way reflects credit; and again, to spend rather upon such works as are of long duration, these being most honourable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Magnificent man to do magnificently whatever he is about: for whatever is of this kind cannot be easily surpassed, and bears a proper proportion to the expenditure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It makes no difference, of course, whether we <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the moral state in the abstract or as exemplified in an individual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1123b] Well then, he is thought to be Great-minded who values himself highly and at the same time justly, because he that does so without grounds is foolish, and no virtuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is foolish or senseless.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Well, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> I have described is Great-minded.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And he is the strongest case of this error who is really a man of great worth, for what would he have done had his worth been less?  The Great-minded man is then, as far as greatness is concerned, at the summit, but in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of propriety he is in the mean, because he estimates himself at his real value (the other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively are in excess and defect).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since then he justly estimates himself at a high, or rather at the highest possible rate, his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> will have <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> specially to one thing: this term "rate" has reference of course to external goods: and of these we should assume that to be the greatest which we attribute to the gods, and which is the special object of desire to those who are in power, and which is the prize proposed to the most honourable actions: now honour answers to these descriptions, being the greatest of external goods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So the Great-minded man bears himself as he ought in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of honour and dishonour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Small-minded man is deficient, both as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s himself, and also as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the estimation of the Great-minded: while the Vain man is in excess as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s himself, but does not get beyond the Great-minded man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would no way correspond with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the Great-minded to flee spreading his hands all abroad; nor to injure any one; for with what object in view will he do what is base, in whose eyes nothing is great? in short, if one were to go into particulars, the Great-minded man would show quite ludicrously unless he were a good man: he would not be in fact deserving of honour if he were a bad man, honour being the prize of virtue and given to the good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This virtue, then, of Great-mindedness seems to be a kind of ornament of all the other virtues, in that it makes them better and cannot be without them; and for this reason it is a hard matter to be really and truly Great-minded; for it cannot be without thorough goodness and nobleness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now though, as I have said, honour is specially the object-matter of the Great-minded man, I do not mean but that likewise in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of wealth and power, and good or bad fortune of every kind, he will bear himself with moderation, fall out how they may, and neither in prosperity will he be overjoyed nor in adversity will he be unduly pained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For not even in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of honour does he so bear himself; and yet it is the greatest of all such objects, since it is the cause of power and wealth being choiceworthy, for certainly they who have them desire to receive honour through them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It seems too that pieces of good fortune contribute to form this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Great-mindedness: I mean, the nobly born, or men of influence, or the wealthy, are considered to be entitled to honour, for they are in a position of eminence and whatever is eminent by good is more entitled to honour: and this is why such circumstances dispose men rather to Great-mindedness, because they receive honour at the hands of some men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now really and truly the good man alone is entitled to honour; only if a man unites in himself goodness with these external advantages he is thought to be more entitled to honour: but they who have them without also having virtue are not justified in their high estimate of themselves, nor are they rightly denominated Great-minded; since perfect virtue is one of the indispensable conditions to such & <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Further, it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Great-minded man to ask favours not at all, or very reluctantly, but to do a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> very readily; and to bear himself loftily towards the great or fortunate, but towards people of middle station affably; because to be above the former is difficult and so a grand thing, but to be above the latter is easy; and to be high and mighty towards the former is not ignoble, but to do it towards those of <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> station would be low and vulgar; it would be like parading strength against the weak.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Likewise to be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful for reality rather than appearance, and talk and act openly (for his contempt for others makes him a bold man, for which same reason he is apt to speak the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, except where the principle of reserve comes in), but to be reserved towards the generality of men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither is his admiration easily excited, because nothing is great in his eyes; nor does he bear malice, since remembering anything, and specially wrongs, is no part of Great-mindedness, but rather overlooking them; nor does he talk of other men; in fact, he will not speak either of himself or of any other; he neither <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s to be praised himself nor to have others blamed; nor again does he praise freely, and for this reason he is not apt to speak ill even of his enemies except to show contempt and insolence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And he is by no means apt to make laments about things which cannot be <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed, or requests about those which are trivial; because to be thus disposed with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to these things is consequent only upon real anxiety about them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Also slow motion, deep-toned voice, and deliberate style of speech, are thought to be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Great-minded man: for he who is earnest about few things is not likely to be in a hurry, nor he who <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>s nothing great to be very intent: and sharp tones and quickness are the result of these.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> However, as we observed in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the last <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> we discussed, these extremes are not thought to be vicious exactly, but only mistaken, for they do no harm.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are not thought to be foolish, but rather laggards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the having such an opinion of themselves seems to have a deteriorating effect on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: because in all cases men's aims are regulated by their supposed desert, and thus these men, under a notion of their own want of desert, stand aloof from honourable actions and courses, and similarly from external goods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in point of fact, men do grasp at Honour more than they should, and less, and sometimes just as they ought; for instance, this state is praised, being a mean state in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> of Honour, but without any appropriate name.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here the extreme <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s appear to be opposed, because the mean has no name appropriated to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   V  Meekness is a mean state, having for its object-matter Anger: and as the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the mean has no name, and we may almost say the same of the extremes, we give the name of Meekness (leaning rather to the defect, which has no name either) to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the mean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> however is thought to err rather on [Sidenote:1126a] the side of defect, inasmuch as he is not apt to take revenge but rather to make allowances and forgive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  VI  Next, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s social intercourse and interchange of words and acts, some men are thought to be Over-Complaisant who, with a view solely to giving pleasure, agree to everything and never oppose, but think their line is to give no pain to those they are thrown amongst: they, on the other hand, are called Cross and Contentious who take exactly the contrary line to these, and oppose in everything, and have no <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> at all whether they give pain or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>However, this state has no name appropriated, but it is most like Friendship; since the man who exhibits it is just the kind of man whom we would call the amiable friend, with the addition of strong earnest affection; but then this is the very point in which it differs from Friendship, that it is quite independent of any feeling or strong affection for those among whom the man mixes: I mean, that he takes everything as he ought, not from any feeling of love or hatred, but simply because his natural <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> leads him to do so; he will do it alike to those whom he does know and those whom he does not, and those with whom he is intimate and those with whom he is not; only in each case as propriety requires, because it is not fitting to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> alike for intimates and strangers, nor again to pain them alike.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Or if the things in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> involve unseemliness to the doer, and this not inconsiderable, or any harm, whereas his opposition will cause some little pain, here he will not agree but will run counter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well, the man bearing the mean <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is pretty well such as I have described him, but he has no name appropriated to him: of those who try to give pleasure, the man who simply and disinterestedly tries to be agreeable is called Over-Complaisant, he who does it with a view to secure some profit in the way of wealth, or those things which wealth may procure, is a Flatterer: I have said before, that the man who is "always non-content" is Cross and Contentious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still it may be as well to go over these states: because, in the first place, by a particular discussion of each we shall be better acquainted with the general subject of moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and next we shall be the more convinced that the virtues are mean states by seeing that this is universally the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> then of living in society, those who carry on this intercourse with a view to pleasure and pain have been already spoken of; we will now go on to speak of those who are True or False, alike in their words and deeds and in the claims which they <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now the Exaggerator is thought to have a tendency to lay claim to things reflecting credit on him, both when they do not belong to him at all and also in greater degree than that in which they really do: whereas the Reserved man, on the contrary, denies those which really belong to him or else depreciates them, while the mean <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> being a Plain-matter-of-fact person is Truthful in life and word, admitting the existence of what does really belong to him and making it neither greater nor less than the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is possible of course to take any of these lines either with or without some further view: but in general men speak, and act, and live, each according to his particular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, unless indeed a man is acting from any special motive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now since falsehood is in itself low and blameable, while <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is noble and praiseworthy, it follows that the Truthful man (who is also in the mean) is praiseworthy, and the two who depart from strict <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> are both blameable, but especially the Exaggerator.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We will now speak of each, and first of the Truthful man: I call him Truthful, because we are not now meaning the man who is true in his agreements nor in such matters as amount to justice or injustice (this would come within the [Sidenote:1127b] province of a different virtue), but, in such as do not involve any such serious difference as this, the man we are describing is true in life and word simply because he is in a certain moral state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And he that is such must be judged to be a good man: for he that has a love for Truth as such, and is guided by it in matters indifferent, will be so likewise even more in such as are not indifferent; for surely he will have a dread of falsehood as base, since he shunned it even in itself: and he that is of such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is praiseworthy, yet he leans rather to that which is below the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, this having an appearance of being in better taste because exaggerations are so annoying.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if a man does this _with_ a special motive, suppose for honour or glory, as the Braggart does, then he is not so very blameworthy, but if, directly or indirectly, for pecuniary <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, he is more unseemly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Reserved, who depreciate their own qualities, have the appearance of being more refined in their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, because they are not thought to speak with a view to gain but to avoid grandeur: one very common trait in such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s is their denying common current opinions, as Socrates used to do.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But they who practise Reserve in moderation, and in cases in which the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is not very obvious and plain, give an impression of refinement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here it is the Exaggerator (as being the worst <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>) who appears to be opposed to the Truthful Man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  VIII  [Sidenote:II28a] Next, as life has its pauses and in them admits of pastime combined with Jocularity, it is thought that in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> also there is a kind of fitting intercourse, and that rules may be prescribed as to the kind of things one should say and the manner of saying them; and in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of hearing likewise (and there will be a difference between the saying and hearing such and such things).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is plain that in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to these things also there will be an excess and defect and a mean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But they who are Jocular in good taste are denominated by a Greek term expressing properly ease of movement, because such are thought to be, as one may say, motions of the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and as bodies are judged of by their motions so too are moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  One quality which belongs to the mean state is Tact: it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of a man of Tact to say and listen to such things as are fit for a good man and a gentleman to say and listen to: for there are things which are becoming for such a one to say and listen to in the way of Jocularity, and there is a difference between the Jocularity of the Gentleman and that of the Vulgarian; and again, between that of the educated and uneducated man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This you may see from a comparison of the Old and New Comedy: in the former obscene talk made the fun; in the latter it is rather innuendo: and this is no slight difference _as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s decency_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, are we to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise him who jests well by his saying what is becoming a gentleman, or by his avoiding to pain the object of his wit, or even by his giving him pleasure? or will not such a definition be vague, since different things are hateful and pleasant to different men?  Be this as it may, whatever he says such things will he also listen to, since it is commonly held that a man will do what he will bear to hear: this must, however, be limited; a man will not do quite all that he will hear: because jesting is a species of scurrility and there are some points of scurrility forbidden by law; it may be certain points of jesting should have been also so forbidden.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such is the mean <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, whether denominated the man of Tact or of Easy Pleasantry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They differ, in that one of them is concerned with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, and the other two with the pleasurable: and of these two again, the one is conversant with the jocosities of life, the other with all other points of social intercourse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, to be such a man as to do anything disgraceful is the part of a faulty <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>     BOOK V  [Sidenote:1129a] Now the points for our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Justice and Injustice are, what kind of actions are their object-matter, and what kind of a mean state Justice is, and between what points the abstract principle of it, i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> shall be, if you please, conducted in the same method as we have observed in the foregoing parts of this treatise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We see then that all men mean by the term Justice a moral state such that in consequence of it men have the capacity of doing what is just, and actually do it, and wish it: similarly also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Injustice, a moral state such that in consequence of it men do unjustly and wish what is unjust: let us also be content then with these as a ground-work sketched out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I mention the two, because the same does not hold with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to States whether of mind or body as with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Sciences or Faculties: I mean that whereas it is thought that the same Faculty or Science embraces contraries, a State will not: from health, for instance, not the contrary acts are done but the healthy ones only; we say a man walks healthily when he walks as the healthy man would.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Now Justice and Injustice do seem to be used <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively in many senses, but, because the line of demarcation between these is very fine and minute, it commonly escapes notice that they are thus used, and it is not plain and manifest as where the various significations of terms are widely different for in these last the visible difference is great, for instance, the word [Greek: klehis] is used equivocally to denote the bone which is under the neck of animals and the instrument with which people close doors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote:1129b] Well, since the Unjust man is also a grasping man, he will be so, of course, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to good things, but not of every kind, only those which are the subject-matter of good and bad fortune and which are in themselves always good but not always to the individual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We said that the violator of Law is Unjust, and the keeper of the Law Just: further, it is plain that all Lawful things are in a manner Just, because by Lawful we <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what have been defined by the legislative power and each of these we say is Just.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Further, the Law commands the doing the deeds not only of the brave man (as not leaving the ranks, nor flying, nor throwing away one's arms), but those also of the perfectly self-mastering man, as abstinence from adultery and wantonness; and those of the meek man, as refraining from striking others or using abusive language: and in like manner in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the other virtues and vices commanding some things and forbidding others, rightly if it is a good law, in a way somewhat inferior if it is one extemporised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now wherein Justice in this sense differs from Virtue appears from what has been said: it is the same really, but the point of view is not the same: in so far as it has <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to one's neighbour it is Justice, in so far as it is such and such a moral state it is simply Virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  II  But the object of our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> is Justice, in the sense in which it is a part of Virtue (for there is such a thing, as we commonly say), and likewise with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to particular Injustice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And of the existence of this last the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is a proof: there are many vices by practising which a man acts unjustly, of course, but does not grasp at more than his share of good; if, for instance, by reason of cowardice he throws away his shield, or by reason of ill-temper he uses abusive language, or by reason of stinginess does not give a friend pecuniary <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance; but whenever he does a grasping action, it is often in the way of none of these vices, certainly not in all of them, still in the way of some vice or other (for we blame him), and in the way of Injustice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now that there is more than one kind of Justice, and that there is one which is distinct from and besides that which is co-extensive with, Virtue, is plain: we must next ascertain what it is, and what are its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Here then let us dismiss any further <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the Justice ranking as co-extensive with Virtue (being the practice of Virtue in all its bearings towards others), and of the co-relative Injustice (being similarly the practice of Vice).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the producing causes of Virtue in all its bearings are those enactments which have been made <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing education for society.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  By the way, as to individual education, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of which a man is simply good without reference to others, whether it is the province of [Greek: politikhae] or some other science we must determine at a future time: for it may be it is not the same thing to be a good man and a good citizen in every case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And further, money is a kind of security to us in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of exchange at some future time (supposing that one wants nothing now that we shall have it when we do): the theory of money being that whenever one brings it one can receive commodities in exchange: of course this too is liable to depreciation, for its purchasing power is not always the same, but still it is of a more permanent nature than the commodities it represents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Injustice is all this with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Unjust: and since the Unjust is excess or defect of what is good or hurtful <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, in violation of the proportionate, therefore Injustice is both excess and defect because it aims at producing excess and defect; excess, that is, in a man's own case of what is simply advantageous, and defect of what is hurtful: and in the case of other men in like manner generally speaking, only that the proportionate is violated not always in one direction as before but whichever way it happens in the given case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: VI] Again, since a man may do unjust acts and not yet have formed a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of injustice, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> arises whether a man is unjust in each particular form of injustice, say a thief, or adulterer, or robber, by doing acts of a given <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We may say, I think, that this will not of itself make any difference; a man may, for instance, have had connection with another's wife, knowing well with whom he was sinning, but he may have done it not of deliberate choice but from the impulse of passion: of course he acts unjustly, but he has not necessarily formed an unjust <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: that is, he may have stolen yet not be a thief; or committed an act of adultery but still not be an adulterer, and so on in other cases which might be enumerated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And again, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> at issue in such cases is not <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the fact but <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the justice of the case, the occasion of anger being a notion of injury.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I mean, that the parties do not dispute about the fact, as in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of contract (where one of the two must be a rogue, unless real forgetfulness can be pleaded), but, admitting the fact, they dispute on which side the justice of the case lies (the one who plotted against the other, _i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 11364] Well then, a man acts unjustly if he has hurt another of deliberate purpose, and he who commits such acts of injustice is _ipso facto_ an unjust <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> when they are in violation of the proportionate or the equal; and in like manner also a man is a just <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> when he acts justly of deliberate purpose, and he does act justly if he acts voluntarily.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: IX] Now a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be raised whether we have spoken with sufficient distinctness as to being unjustly dealt with, and dealing unjustly towards others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  I mean then, is it really possible for a person to be unjustly dealt with with his own consent, or must every case of being unjustly dealt with be against the will of the sufferer as every act of unjust dealing is voluntary?  And next, are cases of being unjustly dealt with to be ruled all one way as every act of unjust dealing is voluntary? or may we say that some cases are voluntary and some involuntary?  Similarly also as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s being justly dealt with: all just acting is voluntary, so that it is fair to suppose that the being dealt with unjustly or justly must be similarly opposed, as to being either voluntary or involuntary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact is a man may also fairly raise this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, whether in every case he who has suffered what is unjust is therefore unjustly dealt with, or rather that the case is the same with suffering as it is with acting; namely that in both it is possible to participate in what is just, but only accidentally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> (This by the way is one of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s raised, whether it is possible for a man to deal unjustly with himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to being unjustly dealt with then, it is clear that it is not voluntary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There remain yet two points on which we purposed to speak: first, is he chargeable with an unjust act who in distribution has _given_ the larger share to one party contrary to the proper rate, or he that _has_ the larger share? next, can a man deal unjustly by himself?  In the first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, if the first-named alternative is possible and it is the distributor who acts unjustly and not he who has the larger share, then supposing that a person knowingly and willingly gives more to another than to himself here is a case of a man dealing unjustly by himself; which, in fact, moderate men are thought to do, for it is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the equitable man to take less than his due.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And again the term doing is used in several senses; in one sense inanimate objects kill, or the hand, or the slave by his master's bidding; so the man in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> does not act unjustly but does things which are in themselves unjust.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this is not really so; to have connection with a neighbour's wife, or strike one's neighbour, or give the money with one's hand, is of course easy and rests with one's self: but the doing these acts with certain inward <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s neither is easy nor rests entirely with one's self.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> True: but then it is not the mere doing these things which constitutes acts of cowardice or injustice (except accidentally), but the doing them with certain inward <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s: just as it is not the mere using or not using the knife, administering or not administering certain drugs, which constitutes medical treatment or curing, but doing these things in a certain particular way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This is a tolerably fair statement of the difficulty which on these grounds arises in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the Equitable; but, in fact, all these may be reconciled and really involve no contradiction: for the Equitable is Just, being also better than one form of Just, but is not better than the Just as though it were different from it in kind: Just and Equitable then are identical, and, both being good, the Equitable is the better of the two.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For to speak generally, the rule of the undefined must be itself undefined also, just as the rule to measure Lesbian building is made of lead: for this rule shifts according to the form of each stone and the special enactment according to the facts of the case in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  XI  The answer to the second of the two <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s indicated above, "whether it is possible for a man to deal unjustly by himself," is obvious from what has been already stated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After all, the general answer to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is to allege what was settled <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing being Unjustly dealt with with one's own consent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> However, scientific statement cannot take in such <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s; a pleurisy, for instance, is called a greater physical evil than a bruise: and yet this last may be the greater accidentally; it may chance that a bruise received in a fall may cause one to be captured by the enemy and slain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now, taking these into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, there is thought to be a possibility of injustice towards one's self, because herein it is possible for men to suffer somewhat in contradiction of impulses really their own; and so it is thought that there is Just of a certain kind between these parts mutually, as between ruler and ruled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Let this then be accepted as an account of the distinctions which we recognise <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Justice and the rest of the moral virtues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now to speak thus is true enough but conveys no very definite meaning: as, in fact, in all other pursuits requiring attention and diligence on which skill and science are brought to bear; it is quite true of course to say that men are neither to labour nor relax too much or too little, but in moderation, and as Right Reason directs; yet if this were all a man had he would not be greatly the wiser; as, for instance, if in answer to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, what are proper applications to the body, he were to be told, "Oh! of course, whatever the science of medicine, and in such manner as the physician, directs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  And so in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the mental states it is requisite not merely that this should be true which has been already stated, but further that it should be expressly laid down what Right Reason is, and what is the definition of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1139a] Now in our division of the Excellences of the Soul, we said there were two classes, the Moral and the Intellectual: the former we have already gone through; and we will now proceed to speak of the others, premising a few words <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the Soul itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  II  There are in the Soul three functions on which depend moral action and <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>; Sense, Intellect, Appetition, whether vague Desire or definite Will.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now this Intellectual operation and this Truth is what bears upon Moral Action; of course <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and falsehood than the conclusion such knowledge as he has will be merely accidental.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1140b] It is thought then to be the property of the Practically Wise man to be able to deliberate well <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing what is good and expedient for himself, not in any definite line, as what is conducive to health or strength, but what to living well.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now no man deliberates <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing things which cannot be otherwise than they are, nor such as lie not within the range of his own action: and so, since Knowledge requires strict demonstrative reasoning, of which Contingent matter does not admit (I say Contingent matter, because all matters of deliberation must be Contingent and deliberation cannot take place with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to things which are Necessarily), Practical Wisdom cannot be Knowledge nor Art; nor the former, because what falls under the province of Doing must be Contingent; not the latter, because Doing and Making are different in kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  For the Principles of the matters of moral action are the final cause of them: now to the man who has been corrupted by reason of pleasure or pain the Principle immediately becomes obscured, nor does he see that it is his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to choose and act in each instance with a view to this final cause and by reason of it: for viciousness has a tendency to destroy the moral Principle: and so Practical Wisdom must be "a state conjoined with reason, true, having human good for its object, and apt to do.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  Then again Art admits of degrees of excellence, but Practical Wisdom does not: and in Art he who goes wrong purposely is preferable to him who does so unwittingly, but not so in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Practical Wisdom or the other Virtues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It comes then to this: since the faculties whereby we always attain <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and are never deceived when dealing with matter Necessary or even Contingent are Knowledge, Practical Wisdom, Science, and Intuition, and the faculty which takes in First Principles cannot be any of the three first; the last, namely Intuition, must be it which performs this function.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  So it is plain that Science must mean the most accurate of all Knowledge; but if so, then the Scientific man must not merely know the deductions from the First Principles but be in possession of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the First Principles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now if "healthy" and "good" are relative terms, differing when applied to men or to fish, but "white" and "straight" are the same always, men must allow that the Scientific is the same always, but the Practically Wise varies: for whatever provides all things well for itself, to this they would apply the term Practically Wise, and commit these matters to it; which is the reason, by the way, that they call some brutes Practically Wise, such that is as plainly have a faculty of forethought <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing their own subsistence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And it is quite plain that Science and [Greek: politikae] cannot be identical: because if men give the name of Science to that faculty which is employed upon what is expedient for themselves, there will be many instead of one, because there is not one and the same faculty employed on the good of all animals collectively, unless in the same sense as you may say there is one art of healing with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all living beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Accordingly, Anexagoras, Thales, and men of that stamp, people call Scientific, but not Practically Wise because they see them ignorant of what concerns themselves; and they say that what they know is quite out of the common run certainly, and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, and hard, and very fine no doubt, but still useless because they do not seek after what is good for them as men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So there will be in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Practical Wisdom the distinction of supreme and subordinate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, that is thought to be Practical Wisdom in the most proper sense which has for its object the interest of the Individual: and this usually appropriates the common name: the others are called <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively Domestic Management, Legislation, Executive Government divided into two branches, Deliberative and Judicial.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Euripides has thus embodied this sentiment; "How," says one of his Characters, "How foolish am I, who whereas I might have shared equally, idly numbered among the multitude of the army .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And again, how a man should manage his own affairs is sometimes not quite plain, and must be made a matter of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, since he who deliberates ill goes wrong, and he who deliberates well does so rightly, it is clear that Good Counsel is rightness of some kind, but not of Knowledge nor of Opinion: for Knowledge cannot be called right because it cannot be wrong, and Rightness of Opinion is Truth: and again, all which is the object of opinion is definitely marked out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Still, however, Good Counsel is not independent of Reason, Does it remain then that it is a rightness of Intellectual Operation simply, because this does not amount to an assertion; and the objection to Opinion was that it is not a process of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> but already a definite assertion; whereas whosoever deliberates, whether well or ill, is engaged in <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> and calculation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well, Good Counsel is a Rightness of deliberation, and so the first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> must <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the nature and objects of deliberation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Good counsel in the general then is that which goes right towards that which is the End in a general way of <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>; in particular, that which does so towards some particular End.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Since then deliberating well is a quality of men possessed of Practical Wisdom, Good Counsel must be "Rightness in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of what conduces to a given End, of which Practical Wisdom is the true conception.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now Judiciousness is neither entirely identical with Knowledge or Opinion (for then all would have been Judicious), nor is it any one specific science, as medical science whose object matter is things wholesome; or geometry whose object matter is magnitude: for it has not for its object things which always exist and are immutable, nor of those things which come into being just any which may chance; but those in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of which a man might doubt and deliberate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>he is disposed to make allowance, for <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s of equity are entertained by all good men alike in transactions with their fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  XII  Well, we have now stated the nature and objects of Practical Wisdom and Science <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, and that they belong each to a different part of the Soul.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I can conceive a person <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ing their utility.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  "If it be urged that _knowing what is_ good does not by itself make a Practically-Wise man but _becoming_ good; still this Wisdom will be no use either to those that are good, and so have it already, or to those who have it not; because it will make no difference to them whether they have it themselves or put themselves under the guidance of others who have; and we might be contented to be in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of this as in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of health: for though we wish to be healthy still we do not set about learning the art of healing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote:1144a] Now first we say that being <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively Excellences of different parts of the Soul they must be choiceworthy, even on the supposition that they neither of them produce results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now Practical Wisdom is not identical with Cleverness, nor is it without this power of adapting means to ends: but this Eye of the Soul (as we may call it) does not attain its proper state without goodness, as we have said before and as is quite plain, because the syllogisms into which Moral Action may be analysed have for their Major Premiss, "since ----------is the End and the Chief Good" (fill up the blank with just anything you please, for we merely want to exhibit the Form, so that anything will do), but _how_ this blank should be filled is seen only by the good man: because Vice distorts the moral vision and causes men to be deceived in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of practical principles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I speak of Natural Virtue, because men hold that each of the moral <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s attach to us all somehow by nature: we have <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s towards justice, self-mastery and courage, for instance, immediately from our birth: but still we seek Goodness in its highest sense as something distinct from these, and that these <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s should attach to us in a somewhat different fashion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This leads some to say that all the Virtues are merely intellectual Practical Wisdom, and Socrates was partly right in his <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> and partly wrong: wrong in that he thought all the Virtues were merely intellectual Practical Wisdom, right in saying they were not independent of that faculty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And by the distinction between Natural and Matured Virtue one can meet the reasoning by which it might be argued "that the Virtues are separable because the same man is not by nature most inclined to all at once so that he will have acquired this one before he has that other:" we would reply that this is possible with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Natural Virtues but not with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to those in right of which a man is denominated simply good: because they will all belong to him together with the one faculty of Practical Wisdom.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>     BOOK VII    I  Next we must take a different point to start from, and observe that of what is to be avoided in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> there are three forms; Vice, Imperfect Self-Control, and Brutishness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And as, on the one hand, it is a rare thing for a man to be godlike (a term the Lacedaemonians are accustomed to use when they admire a man exceedingly; [Greek:seios anhæp] they call him), so the brutish man is rare; the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is found most among barbarians, and some cases of it are caused by disease or maiming; also such men as exceed in vice all ordinary measures we therefore designate by this opprobrious term.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Well, we must in a subsequent place make some mention of this <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and Vice has been spoken of before: for the present we must speak of Imperfect Self-Control and its kindred faults of Softness and Luxury, on the one hand, and of Self-Control and Endurance on the other; since we are to conceive of them, not as being the same states exactly as Virtue and Vice <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, nor again as differing in kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>state the phenomena, and, after raising and discussing difficulties which suggest themselves, then exhibit, if possible, all the opinions afloat <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing these affections of the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; or, if not all, the greater part and the most important: for we may consider we have illustrated the matter sufficiently when the difficulties have been solved, and such theories as are most approved are left as a residuum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some confound the two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the man who has _no_ Self-Control, and the man of _Imperfect Self-Control_, while others distinguish between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, men are said to be of Imperfect Self-Control, not simply but with the addition of the thing wherein, as in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of anger, of honour, and gain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  II  Now a man may raise a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as to the nature of the right conception in violation of which a man fails of Self-Control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  With all due <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Socrates, his account of the matter is at variance with plain facts, and we must inquire with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the affection, if it be caused by ignorance what is the nature of the ignorance: for that the man so failing does not suppose his acts to be right before he is under the influence of passion is quite plain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There are people who partly agree with Socrates and partly not: that nothing can be stronger than Knowledge they agree, but that no man acts in contravention of his conviction of what is better they do not agree; and so they say that it is not Knowledge, but only Opinion, which the man in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> has and yet yields to the instigation of his pleasures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, is it Practical Wisdom which in this case offers opposition: for that is the strongest principle? The supposition is absurd, for we shall have the same man uniting Practical Wisdom and Imperfect Self-Control, and surely no single person would maintain that it is consistent with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Practical Wisdom to do voluntarily what is very wrong; and besides we have shown before that the very mark of a man of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is aptitude to act, as distinguished from mere knowledge of what is right; because he is a man conversant with particular details, and possessed of all the other virtues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, if the having strong and bad lusts is necessary to the idea of the man of Self-Control, this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> cannot be identical with the man of Perfected Self-Mastery, because the having strong desires or bad ones does not enter into the idea of this latter <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: and yet the man of Self-Control must have such: for suppose them good; then the moral state which should hinder a man from following their suggestions must be bad, and so Self-Control would not be in all cases good: suppose them on the other hand to be weak and not wrong, it would be nothing grand; nor anything great, supposing them to be wrong and weak.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Or again, false sophistical reasoning presents a difficulty: for because men wish to prove paradoxes that they may be counted clever when they succeed, the reasoning that has been used becomes a difficulty: for the intellect is fettered; a man being unwilling to abide by the conclusion because it does not please his judgment, but unable to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> because he cannot disentangle the web of sophistical reasoning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to the man of Imperfect Self-Control would apply the proverb, "when water chokes, what should a man drink then?" for had he never been convinced at all in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of [Sidenote: 1146b] what he does, then by a conviction in a contrary direction he might have stopped in his course; but now though he has had convictions he notwithstanding acts against them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  III  Now we must examine first whether men of Imperfect Self-Control act with a knowledge of what is right or not: next, if with such knowledge, in what sense; and next what are we to assume is the object-matter of the man of Imperfect Self-Control, and of the man of Self-Control; I mean, whether pleasure and pain of all kinds or certain definite ones; and as to Self-Control and Endurance, whether these are designations of the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> or different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in like manner we must go into all <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which are connected with the present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But the real starting point of the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> is, whether the two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of Self-Control and Imperfect Self-Control are distinguished by their object-matter, or their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive relations to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I mean, whether the man of Imperfect Self-Control is such simply by virtue of having such and such object-matter; or not, but by virtue of his being related to it in such and such a way, or by virtue of both: next, whether Self-Control and Imperfect Self-Control are unlimited in their object-matter: because he who is designated without any addition a man of Imperfect Self-Control is not unlimited in his object-matter, but has exactly the same as the man who has lost all Self-Control: nor is he so designated because of his relation to this object-matter merely (for then his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would be identical with that just mentioned, loss of all Self-Control), but because of his relation to it being such and such.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now as to the notion that it is True Opinion and not Knowledge in contravention of which men fail in Self-Control, it makes no difference to the point in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, because some of those who hold Opinions have no doubt about them but suppose themselves to have accurate Knowledge; if then it is urged that men holding Opinions will be more likely than men who have Knowledge to act in contravention of their conceptions, as having but a moderate belief in them; we reply, Knowledge will not differ in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> from Opinion: because some men believe their own Opinions no less firmly than others do their positive Knowledge: Heraclitus is a case in point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There is a difference also in universal propositions; a universal proposition may relate partly to a man's self and partly to the thing in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>: take the following for instance; "dry food is good for every man," this may have the two minor premisses, "this is a man," and "so and so is dry food;" but whether a given substance is so and so a man either has not the Knowledge or does not exert it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>According to these different senses there will be an immense difference, so that for a man to _know_ in the one sense, and yet act wrongly, would be nothing strange, but in any of the other senses it would be a matter for <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  As to the manner in which the ignorance is removed and the man of Imperfect Self-Control recovers his Knowledge, the account is the same as with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to him who is drunk or asleep, and is not peculiar to this affection, so physiologists are the right people to apply to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Let this account then be accepted of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the failure in Self-Control, whether it is with Knowledge or not; and, if with knowledge, with what kind of knowledge such failure is possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  IV  The next <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to be discussed is whether there is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to be designated by the term "of Imperfect Self-Control" simply, or whether all who are so are to be accounted such, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of some particular thing; and, if there is such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, what is his object-matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And those who are excessive in their liking for such things contrary to the principle of Right Reason which is in their own breasts we do not designate men of Imperfect Self-Control simply, but with the addition of the thing wherein, as in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of money, or gain, or honour, or anger, and not simply; because we consider them as different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and only having that title in right of a kind of resemblance (as when we add to a man's name "conqueror in the Olympic games" the account of him as Man differs but little from the account of him as the Man who conquered in the Olympic games, but still it is different).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But of those who have for their object-matter the bodily enjoyments, which we say are also the object-matter of the man of Perfected Self-Mastery and the man who has lost all Self-Control, he that pursues excessive pleasures and too much avoids things which are painful (as hunger and thirst, heat and cold, and everything connected with touch and taste), not from moral choice but in spite of his moral choice and intellectual conviction, is termed "a man of Imperfect Self-Control," not with the addition of any particular object-matter as we do in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of want of control of anger but simply.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And a proof that the term is thus applied is that the kindred term "Soft" is used in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of these enjoyments but not in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of any of those others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And for this reason we put into the same rank the man of Imperfect Self-Control, the man who has lost it entirely, the man who has it, and the man of Perfected Self-Mastery; but not any of those other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, because the former have for their object-matter the same pleasures and pains: but though they have the same object-matter, they are not related to it in the same way, but two of them act upon moral choice, two without it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so we should say that man is more entirely given up to his passions who pursues excessive pleasures, and avoids moderate pains, being either not at all, or at least but little, urged by desire, than the man who does so because his desire is very strong: because we think what would the former be likely to do if he had the additional stimulus of youthful lust and violent pain consequent on the want of those pleasures which we have denominated necessary?  Well then, since of desires and pleasures there are some which are in kind honourable and good (because things pleasant are divisible, as we said before, into such as are naturally objects of choice, such as are naturally objects of avoidance, and such as are in themselves indifferent, money, gain, honour, victory, for instance); in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of all such and those that are indifferent, men are blamed not merely for being affected by or desiring or liking them, but for exceeding in any way in these feelings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And so they are blamed, whosoever in spite of Reason are mastered by, that is pursue, any object, though in its nature noble and good; they, for instance, who are more earnest than they should be <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing honour, or their children or parents; not but what these are good objects and men are praised for being earnest about them: but still they admit of excess; for instance, if any one, as Niobe did, should fight even against the gods, or feel towards his father as Satyrus, who got therefrom the nickname of [Greek: philophator], [Sidenote: 1148b] because he was thought to be very foolish.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now depravity there is none in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> of these things, for the reason assigned above, that each of them in itself is a thing naturally choiceworthy, yet the excesses in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of them are wrong and matter for blame: and similarly there is no Imperfect Self-Control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of these things; that being not merely a thing that should be avoided but blameworthy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As then in these cases we do not apply the term simply because each of the states is not a vice, but only like a vice in the way of analogy, so it is plain that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Imperfect Self-Control and Self-Control we must limit the names to those states which have the same object-matter as Perfected Self-Mastery and utter loss of Self-Control, and that we do apply it to the case of anger only in the way of resemblance: for which reason, with an addition, we designate a man of Imperfect Self-Control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of anger, as of honour or of gain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  V  As there are some things naturally pleasant, and of these two kinds; those, namely, which are pleasant generally, and those which are so relatively to particular kinds of animals and men; so there are others which are not naturally pleasant but which come to be so in consequence either of maimings, or custom, or depraved natural tastes: and one may observe moral states similar to those we have been speaking of, having <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively these classes of things for their object-matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote:1149a] Obviously the having any of these inclinations is something foreign to what is denominated Vice, just as Brutishness is: and when a man has them his mastering them is not properly Self-Control, nor his being mastered by them Imperfection of Self-Control in the proper sense, but only in the way of resemblance; just as we may say a man of ungovernable wrath fails of Self-Control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of anger but not simply fails of Self-Control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  VI  It is plain then that the object-matter of Imperfect Self-Control and Self-Control is restricted to the same as that of utter absence of Self-Control and that of Perfected Self-Mastery, and that the rest is the object-matter of a different species so named metaphorically and not simply: we will now examine the position, "that Imperfect Self-Control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Anger is less disgraceful than that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Lusts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>)  Again, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are less unjust in proportion as they involve less insidiousness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  And so since this kind of Imperfect Self-Control is more unjust, it is also more disgraceful than that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Anger, and is simply Imperfect Self-Control, and Vice in a certain sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, it is clear that Imperfect Self-Control in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Lusts is more disgraceful than that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Anger, and that the object-matter of Self-Control, and the Imperfection of it, are bodily Lusts and pleasures; but of these last we must take into account the differences; for, as was said at the commencement, some are proper to the human race and natural both in kind and degree, others Brutish, and others caused by maimings and diseases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1150a] Brutishness is not so low in the scale as Vice, yet it is to be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed with more fear: because it is not that the highest principle has been corrupted, as in the human creature, but the subject has it not at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  VII  Now with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the pleasures and pains which come to a man through Touch and Taste, and the desiring or avoiding such (which we determined before to constitute the object-matter of the states of utter absence of Self-Control and Perfected Self-Mastery), one may be so disposed as to yield to temptations to which most men would be superior, or to be superior to those to which most men would yield: in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of pleasures, these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s will be <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the man of Imperfect Self-Control, and the man of Self-Control; and, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of pains, the man of Softness and the man of Endurance: but the moral state of most men is something between the two, even though they lean somewhat to the worse <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(He that has too little love of pleasure is the opposite <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and the man of Perfected Self-Mastery the mean <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) He is of a similar <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> who avoids the bodily pains, not because he _cannot_, but because he _chooses not to_, withstand them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s who go wrong without _choosing_ so to do, the one is led on by reason of pleasure, the other because he avoids the pain it would cost him to deny his lust; and so they are different the one from the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>However, of the two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have been mentioned [as included in that of utter absence of Self-Control], the one is rather Softness, the other properly the man of no Self-Control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Furthermore, to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Imperfect Self-Control is opposed that of Self-Control, and to that of Softness that of Endurance: because Endurance consists in continued resistance but Self-Control in actual mastery, and continued resistance and actual mastery are as different as not being conquered is from conquering; and so Self-Control is more choiceworthy than Endurance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it is too with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Self-Control and the Imperfection of it: if a man yields to pleasures or pains which are violent and excessive it is no matter for <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, but rather for allowance if he made what resistance he could (instances are, Philoctetes in Theodectes' drama when wounded by the viper; or Cercyon in the Alope of Carcinus, or men who in trying to suppress laughter burst into a loud continuous fit of it, as happened, you remember, to Xenophantus), but it is a matter for <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> when a man yields to and cannot contend against those pleasures or pains which the common herd are able to resist; always supposing his failure not to be owing to natural constitution or disease, I mean, as the Scythian kings are constitutionally Soft, or the natural difference between the sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, the man who is a slave to amusement is commonly thought to be destitute of Self-Control, but he really is Soft; because amusement is an act of relaxing, being an act of resting, and the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is one of those who exceed due bounds in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of this.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Precipitate form of Imperfect Self-Control they are most liable to who are constitutionally of a sharp or melancholy <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>: because the one by reason of the swiftness, the other by reason of the violence, of their passions, do not wait for Reason, because they are disposed to follow whatever notion is impressed upon their minds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  VIII  Again, the man utterly destitute of Self-Control, as was observed before, is not given to remorse: for it is part of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that he abides by his moral choice: but the man of Imperfect Self-Control is almost made up of remorse: and so the case is not as we determined it before, but the former is incurable and the latter may be cured: for depravity is like chronic diseases, dropsy and consumption for instance, but Imperfect Self-Control is like acute disorders: the former being a continuous evil, the latter not so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Well then, that Imperfection of Self-Control is not Confirmed Viciousness is plain: and yet perhaps it is such in a way, because in one sense it is contrary to moral choice and in another the result of it: at all events, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the actions, the case is much like what Demodocus said of the Miletians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since the man of Imperfect Self-Control is of such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as to follow bodily pleasures in excess and in defiance of Right Reason, without acting on any deliberate conviction, whereas the man utterly destitute of Self-Control does act upon a conviction which rests on his natural inclination to follow after these pleasures; the former may be easily persuaded to a different course, but the latter not: for Virtue and Vice <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively preserve and corrupt the moral principle; now the motive is the principle or starting point in moral actions, just as axioms and postulates are in mathematics: and neither in morals nor mathematics is it Reason which is apt to teach the principle; but Excellence, either natural or acquired by custom, in holding right notions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the principle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who does this in morals is the man of Perfected Self-Mastery, and the contrary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is the man utterly destitute of Self-Control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, there is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> liable to be taken off his feet in defiance of Right Reason because of passion; whom passion so far masters as to prevent his acting in accordance with Right Reason, but not so far as to make him be convinced that it is his proper line to follow after such pleasures without limit: this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is the man of Imperfect Self- Control, better than he who is utterly destitute of it, and not a bad man simply and without qualification: because in him the highest and best part, i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>principle, is preserved: and there is another <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> opposed to him who is apt to abide by his resolutions, and not to depart from them; at all events, not at the instigation of passion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Next comes the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, whether a man is a man of Self-Control for abiding by his conclusions and moral choice be they of what kind they may, or only by the right one; or again, a man of Imperfect Self-Control for not abiding by his conclusions and moral choice be they of whatever kind; or, to put the case we did before, is he such for not abiding by false conclusions and wrong moral choice?  Is not this the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that _incidentally_ it is by conclusions and moral choice of any kind that the one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> abides and the other does not, but _per se_ true conclusions and right moral choice: to explain what is meant by incidentally, and _per se_; suppose a man chooses or pursues this thing for the sake of that, he is said to pursue and choose that _per se_, but this only incidentally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the term _per se_ we use commonly the word "simply," and so, in a way, it is opinion of any kind soever by which the two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively abide or not, but he is "simply" entitled to the designations who abides or not by the true opinion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  There are also people, who have a trick of abiding by their, own opinions, who are commonly called Positive, as they who are hard to be persuaded, and whose convictions are not easily changed: now these people bear some resemblance to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Self-Control, just as the prodigal to the liberal or the rash man to the brave, but they are different in many points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here certainly pleasure was the motive of his departure from his resolution, but then it was one of a noble sort: for to be <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>ful was noble in his eyes and he had been persuaded by Ulysses to lie.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Moreover as there is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> who takes less pleasure than he ought in bodily enjoyments, and he also fails to abide by the conclusion of his Reason, the man of Self-Control is the mean between him and the man of Imperfect Self-Control: that is to say, the latter fails to abide by them because of somewhat too much, the former because of somewhat too little; while the man of Self-Control abides by them, and never changes by reason of anything else than such conclusions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>    X  And it is not possible for the same man to be at once a man of Practical Wisdom and of Imperfect Self-Control: because the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Practical Wisdom includes, as we showed before, goodness of moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is no reason why the Clever man should not be of Imperfect Self-Control: and the reason why some men are occasionally thought to be men of Practical Wisdom, and yet of Imperfect Self-Control, is this, that Cleverness differs from Practical Wisdom in the way I stated in a former book, and is very near it so far as the intellectual element is concerned but differs in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the moral choice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is he unjust, because he does not act with deliberate intent: for of the two chief forms of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, the one is not apt to abide by his deliberate resolutions, and the other, the man of constitutional strength of passion, is not apt to deliberate at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  So in fact the man of Imperfect Self-Control is like a community which makes all proper enactments, and has admirable laws, only does not act on them, verifying the scoff of Anaxandrides,  "That State did will it, which <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s nought for laws;" whereas the bad man is like one which acts upon its laws, but then unfortunately they are bad ones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Imperfection of Self-Control and Self-Control, after all, are above the average state of men; because he of the latter <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is more true to his Reason, and the former less so, than is in the power of most men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But we may say more: an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into their nature is absolutely necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  XII   But that the reasons alleged do not prove it either to be not-good or the Chief Good is plain from the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  We have already said in what sense all Pleasures are good _per se_ and in what sense not all are good: it is the latter class that brutes and children pursue, such as are accompanied by desire and pain, that is the bodily Pleasures (which answer to this description) and the excesses of them: in short, those in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of which the man utterly destitute of Self-Control is thus utterly destitute.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  XIV  Some <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into the bodily Pleasures is also necessary for those who say that some Pleasures, to be sure, are highly choiceworthy (the good ones to wit), but not the bodily Pleasures; that is, those which are the object-matter of the man utterly destitute of Self-Control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is not enough however merely to state the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, we should also show how the false view arises; because this strengthens conviction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I mean, when we have given a probable reason why that impresses people as true which really is not true, it gives them a stronger conviction of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, men of the melancholic <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong> constantly need some remedial process (because the body, from its <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>, is constantly being worried), and they are in a chronic state of violent desire.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Furthermore, Friendship <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s the young to keep from error: the old, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of attention and such deficiencies in action as their weakness makes them liable to; and those who are in their prime, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of noble deeds ("They _two_ together going," Homer says, you may remember), because they are thus more able to devise plans and carry them out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Yet the disputed points <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing it are not few: some men lay down that it is a kind of resemblance, and that men who are like one another are friends: whence come the common sayings, "Like will to like," "Birds of a feather," and so on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  These physical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s we will take leave to omit, inasmuch as they are foreign to the present <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>; and we will examine such as are proper to man and concern moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and feelings: as, for instance, "Does Friendship arise among all without distinction, or is it impossible for bad men to be friends?" and, "Is there but one species of Friendship, or several?" for they who ground the opinion that there is but one on the fact that Friendship admits of degrees hold that upon insufficient proof; because things which are different in species admit likewise of degrees (on this point we have spoken before).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> here arises; whether it is good absolutely or that which is good to the individuals, for which men feel Friendship (these two being sometimes distinct): and similarly in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the pleasurable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  III   As the motives to Friendship differ in kind so do the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive feelings and Friendships.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And they whose motive is pleasure are in like case: I mean, they have Friendship for men of easy pleasantry, not because they are of a given <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> but because they are pleasant to themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   IV  Well, this Friendship is perfect both in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the time and in all other points; and exactly the same and similar results accrue to each party from the other; which ought to be the case between friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Between men thus connected Friendships are most permanent when the same result accrues to both from one another, pleasure, for instance; and not merely so but from the same source, as in the case of two men of easy pleasantry; and not as it is in that of a lover and the object of his affection, these not deriving their pleasure from the same causes, but the former from seeing the latter and the latter from receiving the attentions of the former: and when the bloom of youth fades the Friendship sometimes ceases also, because then the lover derives no pleasure from seeing and the object of his affection ceases to receive the attentions which were paid before: in many cases, however, people so connected continue friends, if being of similar tempers they have come from custom to like one another's <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  So then it appears that from motives of pleasure or profit bad men may be friends to one another, or good men to bad men or men of neutral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to one of any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> whatever: but disinterestedly, for the sake of one another, plainly the good alone can be friends; because bad men have no pleasure even in themselves unless in so far as some advantage arises.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And further, the Friendship of the good is alone superior to calumny; it not being easy for men to believe a third person <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing one whom they have long tried and proved: there is between good men mutual confidence, and the feeling that one's friend would never have done one wrong, and all other such things as are expected in Friendship really worthy the name; but in the other kinds there is nothing to prevent all such suspicions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   V  Further; just as in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the different virtues some men are termed good in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of a certain inward state, others in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of acts of working, so is it in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Friendship: I mean, they who live together take pleasure in, and impart good to, one another: but they who are asleep or are locally separated do not perform acts, but only are in such a state as to act in a friendly way if they acted at all: distance has in itself no direct effect upon Friendship, but only prevents the acting it out: yet, if the absence be protracted, it is thought to cause a forgetfulness even of the Friendship: and hence it has been said, "many and many a Friendship doth want of intercourse destroy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They who get on with one another very fairly, but are not in habits of intimacy, are rather like people having kindly feelings towards one another than friends; nothing being so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of friends as the living with one another, because the necessitous desire <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, and the happy companionship, they being the last persons in the world for solitary existence: but people cannot spend their time together unless they are mutually pleasurable and take pleasure in the same objects, a quality which is thought to appertain to the Friendship of companionship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Yet men of these classes entertain kindly feelings towards one another: they wish good to one another and render mutual <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of their needs, but they are not quite friends, because they neither spend their time together nor take pleasure in one another, which circumstances are thought specially to belong to Friendship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But it _is_ possible to please many on the score of advantage and pleasure: because there are many men of the kind, and the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s may be rendered in a very short time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s who unite superiority of station and goodness are not common.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  (It must be remembered, however, that the equal is not in the same case as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s Justice and Friendship: for in strict Justice the exactly proportioned equal ranks first, and the actual numerically equal ranks second, while in Friendship this is exactly reversed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of course, in such cases it is out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to attempt to define up to what point they may continue friends: for you may remove many points of agreement and the Friendship last nevertheless; but when one of the parties is very far separated (as a god from men), it cannot continue any longer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Friendship, moreover, is thought to consist in feeling, rather than being the object of, the sentiment of Friendship, which is proved by the delight mothers have in the feeling: some there are who give their children to be adopted and brought up by others, and knowing them bear this feeling towards them never seeking to have it returned, if both are not possible; but seeming to be content with seeing them well off and bearing this feeling themselves towards them, even though they, by reason of ignorance, never render to them any filial <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> or love.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Equality, then, and similarity are a tie to Friendship, and specially the similarity of goodness, because good men, being stable in themselves, are also stable as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s others, and neither ask degrading <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s nor render them, but, so to say, rather prevent them: for it is the part of the good neither to do wrong themselves nor to allow their friends in so doing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>However, let us drop these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, because they are in fact somewhat foreign to our purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Different also are the principles of Injustice as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s these different grades, and the acts become intensified by being done to friends; for instance, it is worse to rob your companion than one who is merely a fellow-citizen; to refuse <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to a brother than to a stranger; and to strike your father than any one else.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Likenesses, and, as it were, models of them, one may find even in Domestic life: for instance, the Communion between a Father and his Sons presents the figure of Kingship, because the children are the Father's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>: and hence Homer names Jupiter Father because Kingship is intended to be a paternal rule.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(The relation of Master to Slaves is of the nature of Despotism because the point <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed herein is the Master's interest): this now strikes me to be as it ought, but the Persian custom to be mistaken; because for different persons there should be different rules.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   XI  Attendant then on each form of Political Constitution there plainly is Friendship exactly co-extensive with the principle of Justice; that between a King and his Subjects being in the relation of a superiority of benefit, inasmuch as he benefits his subjects; it being assumed that he is a good king and takes <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of their welfare as a shepherd tends his flock; whence Homer (to quote him again) calls Agamemnon, "shepherd of the people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" And of this same kind is the Paternal Friendship, only that it exceeds the former in the greatness of the benefits done; because the father is the author of being (which is <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed the greatest benefit) and of maintenance and education (these things are also, by the way, ascribed to ancestors generally): and by the law of nature the father has the right of rule over his sons, ancestors over their descendants, and the king over his subjects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Fraternal Friendship is like that of Companions, because brothers are equal and much of an age, and such persons have generally like feelings and like <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s serve also to show why mothers have greater strength of affection than fathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Then again the being brought up together, and the nearness of age, are a great <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> towards Friendship, for a man likes one of his own age and persons who are used to one another are companions, which accounts for the resemblance between the Friendship of Brothers and that of Companions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote:1162a] And cousins and all other relatives derive their bond of union from these, that is to say, from their community of origin: and the strength of this bond varies according to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive distances from the common ancestor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then again in the Fraternal Friendship there is all that there is in that of Companions, and more in the good, and generally in those who are alike; in proportion as they are more closely tied and from their very birth have a feeling of affection for one another to begin with, and as they are more like in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> who spring from the same stock and have grown up together and been educated alike: and besides this they have the greatest opportunities in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of time for proving one another, and can therefore depend most securely upon the trial.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And procreation is more common to him with other animals; all the other animals have Communion thus far, but human creatures cohabit not merely for the sake of procreation but also with a view to life in general: because in this connection the works are immediately divided, and some belong to the man, others to the woman: thus they <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> one the other, putting what is peculiar to each into the common stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> how a man is to live with his wife, or (more generally) one friend with another, appears to be no other than this, how it is just that they should: because plainly there is not the same principle of Justice between a friend and friend, as between strangers, or companions, or mere chance fellow-travellers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Legal is upon specified conditions, either purely tradesmanlike from hand to hand or somewhat more gentlemanly as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s time but still by agreement a _quid pro quo_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But one ought at the first to ascertain from whom one is receiving kindness, and on what <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing, that on that same <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing one may accept it or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> admitting of dispute is whether one is to measure a kindness by the good done to the receiver of it, and make this the standard by which to requite, or by the kind intention of the doer?  For they who have received kindnesses frequently plead in depreciation that they have received from their benefactors such things as were small for them to give, or such as they themselves could have got from others: while the doers of the kindnesses affirm that they gave the best they had, and what could not have been got from others, and under danger, or in such-like straits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  May we not say, that as utility is the motive of the Friendship the advantage conferred on the receiver must be the standard? because he it is who requests the kindness and the other serves him in his need on the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing that he is to get an equivalent: the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance rendered is then exactly proportionate to the advantage which the receiver has obtained, and he should therefore repay as much as he gained by it, or even more, this being more creditable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  In Friendships based on goodness, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, of course, is never raised, but herein the motive of the doer seems to be the proper standard, since virtue and moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> depend principally on motive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The man who is better than the other thinks that having the greater share pertains to him of right, for that more is always awarded to the good man: and similarly the man who is more profitable to another than that other to him: "one who is useless," they say, "ought not to share equally, for it comes to a tax, and not a Friendship, unless the fruits of the Friendship are reaped in proportion to the works done:" their notion being, that as in a money <strong style='color: red'>partnership</strong> they who contribute more receive more so should it be in Friendship likewise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  On the other hand, the needy man and the less virtuous <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the opposite claim: they urge that "it is the very business of a good friend to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> those who are in need, else what is the use of having a good or powerful friend if one is not to reap the advantage at all?"  [Sidenote: 1163b] Now each seems to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> a right claim and to be entitled to get more out of the connection than the other, only _not more of the same thing_: but the superior man should receive more <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, the needy man more profit: <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> being the reward of goodness and beneficence, profit being the aid of need.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This is plainly the principle acted upon in Political Communities: he receives no honour who gives no good to the common stock: for the property of the Public is given to him who does good to the Public, and honour is the property of the Public; it is not possible both to make money out of the Public and receive honour likewise; because no one will put up with the less in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>: so to him who suffers loss as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s money they award honour, but money to him who can be paid by gifts: since, as has been stated before, the observing due proportion equalises and preserves Friendship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Like rules then should be observed in the intercourse of friends who are unequal; and to him who advantages another in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of money, or goodness, that other should repay honour, making requital according to his power; because Friendship requires what is possible, not what is strictly due, this being not possible in all cases, as in the honours paid to the gods and to parents: no man could ever make the due return in these cases, and so he is thought to be a good man who pays <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> according to his ability.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But at the same time it must perhaps be admitted, that it seems no father ever _would_ sever himself utterly from a son, except in a case of exceeding depravity: because, independently of the natural Friendship, it is like human nature not to put away from one's self the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance which a son might render.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to the son, if depraved, <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ing his father is a thing to be avoided, or at least one which he will not be very anxious to do; most men being willing enough to receive kindness, but averse to doing it as unprofitable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These cases occur because the Friendship of the lover for the beloved object is based upon pleasure, that of the other for him upon utility, and in one of the parties the requisite quality is not found: for, as these are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the grounds of the Friendship, the Friendship comes to be broken up because the motives to it cease to exist: the parties loved not one another but qualities in one another which are not permanent, and so neither are the Friendships: whereas the Friendship based upon the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the parties, being independent and disinterested, is permanent, as we have already stated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> then arises, who is to fix the rate? the man who first gives, or the man who first takes? because, _prima facie_, the man who first gives seems to leave the rate to be fixed by the other party.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  They are certainly fairly found fault with who take the money in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> and then do nothing of what they said they would do, their promises having been so far beyond their ability; for such men do not perform what they agreed, The Sophists, however, are perhaps obliged to take this course, because no one would give a sixpence for their knowledge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1164b] In cases where no stipulation as to the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s is made they who disinterestedly do the first <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> will not raise the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> (as we have said before), because it is the nature of Friendship, based on mutual goodness to be reference to the intention of the other, the intention being <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the true friend and of goodness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   II  Questions also arise upon such points as the following: Whether one's father has an unlimited claim on one's <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s and obedience, or whether the sick man is to obey his physician? or, in an election of a general, the warlike qualities of the candidates should be alone <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed?  In like manner whether one should do a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> rather to one's friend or to a good man? whether one should rather requite a benefactor or give to one's companion, supposing that both are not within one's power?  [Sidenote: 1165a] Is not the true answer that it is no easy task to determine all such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s accurately, inasmuch as they involve numerous differences of all kinds, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of amount and what is honourable and what is necessary? It is obvious, of course, that no one person can unite in himself all claims.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, the requital of benefits is, in general, a higher <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> than doing unsolicited kindnesses to one's companion; in other words, the discharging of a debt is more obligatory upon one than the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of giving to a companion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And yet this rule may admit of exceptions; for instance, which is the higher <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>? for one who has been ransomed out of the hands of robbers to ransom in return his ransomer, be he who he may, or to repay him on his demand though he has not been taken by robbers, or to ransom his own father? for it would seem that a man ought to ransom his father even in preference to himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, as has been said already, as a general rule the debt should be discharged, but if in a particular case the giving greatly preponderates as being either honourable or necessary, we must be swayed by these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s: I mean, in some cases the requital of the obligation previously existing may not be equal; suppose, for instance, that the original benefactor has conferred a kindness on a good man, knowing him to be such, whereas this said good man has to repay it believing him to be a scoundrel.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In short, as has been oftentimes stated before, all statements <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing feelings and actions can be definite only in proportion as their object-matter is so; it is of course quite obvious that all people have not the same claim upon one, nor are the claims of one's father unlimited; just as Jupiter does not claim all kinds of sacrifice without distinction: and since the claims of parents, brothers, companions, and benefactors, are all different, we must give to each what belongs to and befits each.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And it would seem that in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of maintenance it is our <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> our parents in preference to all others, as being their debtors, and because it is more honourable to succour in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the authors of our existence than ourselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  To all our elders also the honour befitting their age, by rising up in their presence, turning out of the way for them, and all similar marks of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>: to our companions again, or brothers, frankness and free participation in all we have.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And to those of the same family, or tribe, or city, with ourselves, and all similarly connected with us, we should constantly try to render their due, and to discriminate what belongs to each in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of nearness of connection, or goodness, or intimacy: of course in the case of those of the same class the discrimination is easier; in that of those who are in different classes it is a matter of more trouble.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  III  A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is also raised as to the propriety of dissolving or not dissolving those Friendships the parties to which do not remain what they were when the connection was formed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1165b] Now surely in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of those whose motive to Friendship is utility or pleasure there can be nothing wrong in breaking up the connection when they no longer have those qualities; because they were friends [not of one another, but] of those qualities: and, these having failed, it is only reasonable to expect that they should cease to entertain the sentiment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But a man has reason to find fault if the other party, being really attached to him because of advantage or pleasure, pretended to be so because of his moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: in fact, as we said at the commencement, the most common source of quarrels between friends is their not being friends on the same grounds as they suppose themselves to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now when a man has been deceived in having supposed himself to excite the sentiment of Friendship by reason of his moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, the other party doing nothing to indicate he has but himself to blame: but when he has been deceived by the pretence of the other he has a right to find fault with the man who has so deceived him, aye even more than with utterers of false coin, in proportion to the greater preciousness of that which is the object-matter of the villany.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Are we then to break with him instantly? not in all cases; only where our friends are incurably depraved; when there is a chance of amendment we are bound to aid in repairing the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of our friends even more than their substance, in proportion as it is better and more closely related to Friendship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still he who should break off the connection is not to be judged to act wrongly, for he never was a friend to such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as the other now is, and therefore, since the man is changed and he cannot reduce him to his original state, he backs out of the connection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  To put another case: suppose that one party remains what he was when the Friendship was formed, while the other becomes morally <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and widely different from his friend in goodness; is the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to treat the other as a friend?  May we not say it is impossible? The case of course is clearest where there is a great difference, as in the Friendships of boys: for suppose that of two boyish friends the one still continues a boy in mind and the other becomes a man of the highest <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, how can they be friends? since they neither are pleased with the same objects nor like and dislike the same things: for these points will not belong to them as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s one another, and without them it was assumed they cannot be friends because they cannot live in intimacy: and of the case of those who cannot do so we have spoken before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well then, is the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d party to bear himself towards his former friend in no way differently to what he would have done had the connection never existed?  Surely he ought to bear in mind the intimacy of past times, and just as we think ourselves bound to do favours for our friends in preference to strangers, so to those who have been friends and are so no longer we should allow somewhat on the score of previous Friendship, whenever the cause of severance is not excessive depravity on their part.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>     IV  [Sidenote: II66a] Now the friendly feelings which are exhibited towards our friends, and by which Friendships are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, seem to have sprung out of those which we entertain toward ourselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well, by some one of these marks people generally <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise Friendship: and each of these the good man has towards himself, and all others have them in so far as they suppose themselves to be good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>)  For he is at unity in himself, and with every part of his soul he desires the same objects; and he wishes for himself both what is, and what he believes to be, good; and he does it (it being <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the good man to work at what is good), and for the sake of himself, inasmuch as he does it for the sake of his Intellectual Principle which is generally thought to be a man's Self.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But it is to himself that each individual wishes what is good, and no man, conceiving the possibility of his becoming other than he now is, chooses that that New Self should have all things indiscriminately: a god, for instance, has at the present moment the Chief Good, but he has it in right of being whatever he actually now is: and the Intelligent Principle must be judged to be each man's Self, or at least eminently so [though other Principles <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>, of course, to constitute him the man he is].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether or no there can really be Friendship between a man and his Self is a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we will not at present entertain: there may be thought to be Friendship, in so far as there are two or more of the aforesaid requisites, and because the highest degree of Friendship, in the usual acceptation of that term, resembles the feeling entertained by a man towards himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Neither, in fact, can they who are of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> sympathise with their Selves in their joys and sorrows, because their soul is, as it were, rent by faction, and the one principle, by reason of the depravity in them, is grieved at abstaining from certain things, while the other and better principle is pleased thereat; and the one drags them this way and the other that way, as though actually tearing them asunder.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If then to be thus is exceedingly wretched it is a man's <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to flee from wickedness with all his might and to strive to be good, because thus may he be friends with himself and may come to be a friend to another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again Affection requires intimacy but Kindly Feeling may arise quite suddenly, as happens sometimes in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of men against whom people are matched in any way, I mean they come to be kindly disposed to them and sympathise in their wishes, but still they would not join them in any action, because, as we said, they conceive this feeling of kindness suddenly and so have but a superficial liking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Exactly in the same way men cannot be friends without having passed through the stage of Kindly Feeling, and yet they who are in that stage do not necessarily <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> to Friendship: they merely have an inert wish for the good of those toward whom they entertain the feeling, but would not join them in any action, nor put themselves out of the way for them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Nor do men usually say people are united in sentiment merely because they agree in opinion on _any_ point, as, for instance, on points of astronomical science (Unity of Sentiment herein not having any connection with Friendship), but they say that Communities have Unity of Sentiment when they agree <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing points of expediency and take the same line and carry out what has been determined in common consultation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[Sidenote: 1167_b_] But when each wishes himself to be in power (as the brothers in the Phoenissæ), they quarrel and form parties: for, plainly, Unity of Sentiment does not merely imply that each entertains the same idea be it what it may, but that they do so in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the same object, as when both the populace and the sensible men of a State desire that the best men should be in office, because then all attain their object.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The bad, on the contrary, can as little have Unity of Sentiment as they can be real friends, except to a very slight extent, desiring as they do unfair advantage in things profitable while they shirk labour and <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> for the common good: and while each man wishes for these things for himself he is jealous of and hinders his neighbour: and as they do not watch over the common good it is lost.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: VII] Benefactors are commonly held to have more Friendship for the objects of their kindness than these for them: and the fact is made a subject of discussion and <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, as being contrary to reasonable expectation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Then again, the benefactor has a sense of honour in right of his action, so that he may well take pleasure in him in whom this resides; but to him who has received the benefit there is nothing honourable in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of his benefactor, only something advantageous which is both less pleasant and less the object of Friendship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: VIII] A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is also raised as to whether it is right to love one's Self best, or some one else: because men find fault with those who love themselves best, and call them in a disparaging way lovers of Self; and the bad man is thought to do everything he does for his own sake merely, and the more so the more depraved he is; accordingly men reproach him with never doing anything unselfish: whereas the good man acts from a sense of honour (and the more so the better man he is), and for his friend's sake, and is <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less of his own interest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Now these conditions, and in fact all the rest by which a friend is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, belong specially to each individual in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of his Self: for we have said before that all the friendly feelings are derived to others from those which have Self primarily for their object.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It is with good reason <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed which of the two parties one should follow, both having plausibility on their side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps then, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of theories of this kind, the proper course is to distinguish and define how far each is true, and in what way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Well now, they who use it disparagingly give the name to those who, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of wealth, and honours, and pleasures of the body, give to themselves the larger share: because the mass of mankind grasp after these and are earnest about them as being the best things; which is the reason why they are matters of contention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They who are covetous in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to these gratify their lusts and passions in general, that is to say the irrational part of their soul: now the mass of mankind are so disposed, for which reason the appellation has taken its rise from that mass which is low and bad.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now all approve and commend those who are eminently earnest about honourable actions, and if all would vie with one another in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the [Greek: kalhon], and be intent upon doing what is most truly noble and honourable, society at large would have all that is proper while each individual in particular would have the greatest of goods, Virtue being assumed to be such.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is the same with honours and offices; all these things he will give up to his friend, because this reflects honour and praise on himself: and so with good reason is he <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a fine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> since he chooses the honourable before all things else.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: IX] A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is raised also <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the Happy man, whether he will want Friends, or no?  Some say that they who are blessed and independent have no need of Friends, for they already have all that is good, and so, as being independent, want nothing further: whereas the notion of a friend's office is to be as it were a second Self and procure for a man what he cannot get by himself: hence the saying,  "When Fortune gives us good, what need we Friends?"  On the other hand, it looks absurd, while we are assigning to the Happy man all other good things, not to give him Friends, which are, after all, thought to be the greatest of external goods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, if it is more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of a friend to confer than to receive kindnesses, and if to be beneficent belongs to the good man and to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of virtue, and if it is more noble to confer kindnesses on friends than strangers, the good man will need objects for his benefactions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And out of this last <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> springs a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the need of Friends be greater in prosperity or adversity, since the unfortunate man wants people to do him kindnesses and they who are fortunate want objects for their kind acts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, common opinion requires that the Happy man live with pleasure to himself: now life is burthensome to a man in solitude, for it is not easy to work continuously by one's self, but in company with, and in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to others, it is easier, and therefore the working, being pleasurable in itself will be more continuous (a thing which should be in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the Happy man); for the good man, in that he is good takes pleasure in the actions which accord with Virtue and is annoyed at those which spring from Vice, just as a musical man is pleased with beautiful music and annoyed by bad.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And besides, as Theognis says, Virtue itself may be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by practice, from living with the good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And, upon the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s more purely metaphysical, it will probably appear that the good friend is naturally choiceworthy to the good man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have said before, that whatever is naturally good is also in itself good and pleasant to the good man; now the fact of living, so far as animals are concerned, is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised generally by the power of sentience, in man it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by that of sentience, or of rationality (the faculty of course being referred to the actual operation of the faculty, certainly the main point is the actual operation of it); so that living seems mainly to consist in the act of sentience or exerting rationality: now the fact of living is in itself one of the things that are good and pleasant (for it is a definite totality, and whatever is such belongs to the nature of good), but what is naturally good is good to the good man: for which reason it seems to be pleasant to all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Are we then to make our friends as numerous as possible? or, as in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of acquaintance it is thought to have been well said "have not thou many acquaintances yet be not without;" so too in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Friendship may we adopt the precept, and say that a man should not be without friends, nor again have exceeding many friends?  Now as for friends who are intended for use, the maxim I have quoted will, it seems, fit in exceedingly well, because to requite the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s of many is a matter of labour, and a whole life would not be long enough to do this for them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that, if more numerous than what will suffice for one's own life, they become officious, and are hindrances in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of living well: and so we do not want them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And if we look to facts this seems to be so: for not many at a time become friends in the way of companionship, all the famous Friendships of the kind are between _two_ persons: whereas they who have many friends, and meet everybody on the footing of intimacy, seem to be friends really to no one except in the way of general society; I mean the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s denominated as over-complaisant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   XI  Again: are friends most needed in prosperity or in adversity? they are required, we know, in both states, because the unfortunate need <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> and the prosperous want people to live with and to do kindnesses to: for they have a desire to act kindly to some one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the very presence of friends is pleasant even in adversity: since men when grieved are comforted by the <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> of their friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And from this, by the way, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> might be raised, whether it is that they do in a manner take part of the weight of calamities, or only that their presence, being pleasurable, and the consciousness of their <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, make the pain of the sufferer less.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: _1171b_] But their presence has probably a mixed effect: I mean, not only is the very seeing friends pleasant, especially to one in misfortune, and actual <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> towards lessening the grief is afforded (the natural tendency of a friend, if he is gifted with tact, being to comfort by look and word, because he is well acquainted with the sufferer's temper and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and therefore knows what things give him pleasure and pain), but also the perceiving a friend to be grieved at his misfortunes causes the sufferer pain, because every one avoids being cause of pain to his friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is plain that it is our <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> in all things to imitate the highest <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  One should perhaps be cautious not to present the appearance of sullenness in declining the <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> or <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of friends, for this happens occasionally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  May we not say then that, as seeing the beloved object is most prized by lovers and they choose this sense rather than any of the others because Love  "Is engendered in the eyes, With gazing fed,"  in like manner intimacy is to friends most choiceworthy, Friendship being communion? Again, as a man is to himself so is he to his friend; now with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to himself the perception of his own existence is choiceworthy, therefore is it also in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of his friend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Therefore the Friendship of the wicked comes to be depraved; for, being unstable, they share in what is bad and become depraved in being made like to one another: but the Friendship of the good is good, growing with their intercourse; they <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> also, as it seems, by repeated acts, and by mutual correction, for they receive impress from one another in the points which give them pleasure; whence says the poet,  "Thou from the good, good things shalt surely learn.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>     BOOK X   Next, it would seem, follows a discussion <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Pleasure, for it is thought to be most closely bound up with our kind: and so men train the young, guiding them on their course by the rudders of Pleasure and Pain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> And to like and dislike what one ought is judged to be most important for the formation of good moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: because these feelings extend all one's life through, giving a bias towards and exerting an influence on the side of Virtue and Happiness, since men choose what is pleasant and avoid what is painful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I confess I suspect the soundness of this policy; in matters <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing men's feelings and actions theories are less convincing than facts: whenever, therefore, they are found conflicting with actual experience, they not only are despised but involve the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in their fall: he, for instance, who deprecates Pleasure, if once seen to aim at it, gets the credit of backsliding to it as being universally such as he said it was, the mass of men being incapable of nice distinctions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But of such <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s enough: let us now proceed to the current maxims <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  (And his theories were received, not so much for their own sake, as because of his excellent moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; for he was thought to be eminently possessed of perfect self-mastery, and therefore it was not thought that he said these things because he was a lover of Pleasure but that he really was so convinced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Nor does that seem to be sound which is urged <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the argument from the contrary: I mean, some people say "it does not follow that Pleasure must be good because Pain is evil, since evil may be opposed to evil, and both evil and good to what is indifferent:" now what they say is right enough in itself but does not hold in the present instance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now if they judge this from the act of feeling Pleasure then the same thing will apply to justice and all the other virtues, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of which clearly it is said that men are more or less of such and such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (according to the different virtues), they are more just or more brave, or one may practise justice and self-mastery more or less.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If, on the other hand, they judge in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the Pleasures themselves then it may be they miss the true cause, namely that some are unmixed and others mixed: for just as health being in itself limited, admits of degrees, why should not Pleasure do so and yet be limited? in the former case we account for it by the fact that there is not the same adjustment of parts in all men, nor one and the same always in the same individual: but health, though relaxed, remains up to a certain point, and differs in degrees; and of course the same may be the case with Pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let this then suffice by way of an account of the current maxims <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing Pleasure and Pain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: IV]  Now what it is, and how <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, will be more plain if we take up the subject afresh.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And this might appear also from the impossibility of moving except in a definite time, whereas there is none with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the sensation of Pleasure, for what exists at the very present moment is a kind of "whole.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s then it is plain that people are not warranted in saying that Pleasure is a Movement or a Generation: because these terms are not applicable to all things, only to such as are divisible and not "wholes:" I mean that of an act of Sight there is no Generation, nor is there of a point, nor of a monad, nor is any one of these a Movement or a Generation: neither then of Pleasure is there Movement or Generation, because it is, as one may say, "a whole.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"  Now since every Percipient Faculty works upon the Object answering to it, and perfectly the Faculty in a good state upon the most excellent of the Objects within its range (for Perfect Working is thought to be much what I have described; and we will not raise any <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> about saying "the Faculty" works, instead of, "that subject wherein the Faculty resides"), in each case the best Working is that of the Faculty in its best state upon the best of the Objects answering to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there are some things which please when new, but afterwards not in the like way, for exactly the same reason: that at first the mind is roused and works on these Objects with its powers at full tension; just as they who are gazing stedfastly at anything; but afterwards the act of Working is not of the kind it was at first, but <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less, and so the Pleasure too is dulled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, a person may conclude that all men grasp at Pleasure, because all aim likewise at Life and Life is an act of Working, and every man works at and with those things which also he best likes; the musical man, for instance, works with his hearing at music; the studious man with his intellect at speculative <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, and so forth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> then that they aim also at Pleasure, because to each it perfects Life, which is itself choiceworthy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(We will take leave to omit the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether we choose Life for Pleasure's sake of Pleasure for Life's sake; because these two plainly are closely connected and admit not of separation; since Pleasure comes not into being without Working, and again, every Working Pleasure perfects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  This may be shown also from the intimate connection subsisting between each Pleasure and the Working which it perfects: I mean, that the Pleasure proper to any Working increases that Working; for they who work with Pleasure sift all things more closely and carry them out to a greater degree of nicety; for instance, those men become geometricians who take Pleasure in geometry, and they apprehend particular points more completely: in like manner men who are fond of music, or architecture, or anything else, <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> each on his own pursuit, because they feel Pleasure in them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Furthermore, the Pleasures attendant on Workings are more closely connected with them even than the desires after them: for these last are separate both in time and nature, but the former are close to the Workings, and so indivisible from them as to raise a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the Working and the Pleasure are identical; but Pleasure does not seem to be an Intellectual Operation nor a Faculty of Perception, because that is absurd; but yet it gives some the impression of being the same from not being separated from these.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is it at all astonishing that what are to him unpleasant should give another person the impression of being pleasant, for men are liable to many corruptions and marrings; and the things in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> are not pleasant really, only to these particular persons, and to them only as being thus disposed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still the common run of those who are judged happy take refuge in such pastimes, which is the reason why they who have varied talent in such are highly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed among despots; because they make themselves pleasant in those things which these aim at, and these accordingly want such men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  That it is Contemplative has been already stated: and this would seem to be consistent with what we said before and with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>: for, in the first place, this Working is of the highest kind, since the Intellect is the highest of our internal Principles and the subjects with which it is conversant the highest of all which fall within the range of our knowledge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And the Self-Sufficiency which people speak of will attach chiefly to the Contemplative Working: of course the actual necessaries of life are needed alike by the man of science, and the just man, and all the other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; but, supposing all sufficiently supplied with these, the just man needs people towards whom, and in concert with whom, to practise his justice; and in like manner the man of perfected self-mastery, and the brave man, and so on of the rest; whereas the man of science can contemplate and speculate even when quite alone, and the more entirely he deserves the appellation the more able is he to do so: it may be he can do better for having fellow-workers but still he is certainly most Self-Sufficient.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now all the Practical Virtues require either society or war for their Working, and the actions <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing these are thought to exclude rest; those of war entirely, because no one chooses war, nor prepares for war, for war's sake: he would indeed be thought a bloodthirsty villain who should make enemies of his friends to secure the existence of fighting and bloodshed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If then of all the actions in accordance with the various virtues those of policy and war are pre-eminent in honour and greatness, and these are restless, and aim at some further End and are not choiceworthy for their own sakes, but the Working of the Intellect, being apt for contemplation, is thought to excel in earnestness, and to aim at no End beyond itself and to have Pleasure of its own which <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s to increase the Working, and if the attributes of Self-Sufficiency, and capacity of rest, and unweariedness (as far as is compatible with the infirmity of human nature), and all other attributes of the highest Happiness, plainly belong to this Working, this must be perfect Happiness, if attaining a complete duration of life, which condition is added because none of the points of Happiness is incomplete.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>   VIII  And second in degree of Happiness will be that Life which is in accordance with the other kind of Excellence, for the Workings in accordance with this are proper to Man: I mean, we do actions of justice, courage, and the other virtues, towards one another, in contracts, <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s of different kinds, and in all kinds of actions and feelings too, by observing what is befitting for each: and all these plainly are proper to man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further, the Excellence of the Moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is thought to result in some points from physical circumstances, and to be, in many, very closely connected with the passions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Again, Practical Wisdom and Excellence of the Moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> are very closely united; since the Principles of Practical Wisdom are in accordance with the Moral Virtues and these are right when they accord with Practical Wisdom.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But that of the Pure Intellect is separate and distinct: and let this suffice upon the subject, since great exactness is beyond our purpose,  It would seem, moreover, to require supply of external goods to a small degree, or certainly less than the Moral Happiness: for, as far as necessaries of life are concerned, we will suppose both <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to need them equally (though, in point of fact, the man who lives in society does take more pains about his person and all that kind of thing; there will really be some little difference), but when we come to consider their Workings there will be found a great difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  I mean, the liberal man must have money to do his liberal actions with, and the just man to meet his engagements (for mere intentions are uncertain, and even those who are unjust make a pretence of _wishing_ to do justly), and the brave man must have power, if he is to perform any of the actions which appertain to his particular Virtue, and the man of perfected self-mastery must have opportunity of temptation, else how shall he or any of the others display his real <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>?  [Sidenote: 1178b]  (By the way, a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is sometimes raised, whether the moral choice or the actions have most to do with Virtue, since it consists in both: it is plain that the perfection of virtuous action requires both: but for the actions many things are required, and the greater and more numerous they are the more.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) But as for the man engaged in Contemplative Speculation, not only are such things unnecessary for his Working, but, so to speak, they are even hindrances: as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the Contemplation at least; because of course in so far as he is Man and lives in society he chooses to do what Virtue requires, and so he will need such things for maintaining his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as Man though not as a speculative philosopher.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And that the perfect Happiness must be a kind of Contemplative Working may appear also from the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>: our conception of the gods is that they are above all blessed and happy: now what kind of Moral actions are we to attribute to them? those of justice? nay, will they not be set in a ridiculous light if represented as forming contracts, and restoring deposits, and so on? well then, shall we picture them performing brave actions, withstanding objects of fear and meeting dangers, because it is noble to do so? or liberal ones? but to whom shall they be giving? and further, it is absurd to think they have money or anything of the kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Anaxagoras also seems to have conceived of the Happy man not as either rich or powerful, saying that he should not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> if he were accounted a strange man in the judgment of the multitude: for they judge by outward circumstances of which alone they have any perception.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  And thus the opinions of the Wise seem to be accordant with our account of the matter: of course such things carry some weight, but <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, in matters of moral action, is judged from facts and from actual life, for herein rests the decision.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now he that works in accordance with, and pays observance to, Pure Intellect, and tends this, seems likely to be both in the best frame of mind and dearest to the Gods: because if, as is thought, any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is bestowed on human things by the Gods then it must be reasonable to think that they take pleasure in what is best and most akin to themselves (and this must be the Pure Intellect); and that they requite with kindness those who love and honour this most, as paying observance to what is dear to them, and as acting rightly and nobly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>    IX  Now then that we have said enough in our sketchy kind of way on these subjects; I mean, on the Virtues, and also on Friendship and Pleasure; are we to suppose that our original purpose is completed? Must we not rather acknowledge, what is commonly said, that in matters of moral action mere Speculation and Knowledge is not the real End but rather Practice: and if so, then neither in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of Virtue is Knowledge enough; we must further strive to have and exert it, and take whatever other means there are of becoming good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Now if talking and writing were of themselves sufficient to make men good, they would justly, as Theognis observes have reaped numerous and great rewards, and the thing to do would be to provide them: but in point of fact, while they plainly have the power to guide and stimulate the generous among the young and to base upon true virtuous principle any noble and truly high-minded <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, they as plainly are powerless to guide the mass of men to Virtue and goodness; because it is not their nature to be amenable to a sense of shame but only to fear; nor to abstain from what is low and mean because it is disgraceful to do it but because of the punishment attached to it: in fact, as they live at the beck and call of passion, they pursue their own proper pleasures and the means of securing them, and they avoid the contrary pains; but as for what is noble and truly pleasurable they have not an idea of it, inasmuch as they have never tasted of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Men such as these then what mere words can transform? No, indeed! it is either actually impossible, or a task of no mean difficulty, to alter by words what has been of old taken into men's very <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s: and, it may be, it is a ground for contentment if with all the means and appliances for goodness in our hands we can attain to Virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The formation of a virtuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> some ascribe to Nature, some to Custom, and some to Teaching.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For he that lives in obedience to passion cannot hear any advice that would dissuade him, nor, if he heard, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>: now him that is thus how can one reform? in fact, generally, passion is not thought to yield to Reason but to brute force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> So then there must be, to begin with, a kind of affinity to Virtue in the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; which must cleave to what is honourable and loath what is disgraceful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  [Sidenote: 1180_a_] Yet perhaps it is not sufficient that men while young should get right food and tendance, but, inasmuch as they will have to practise and become accustomed to certain things even after they have attained to man's estate, we shall want laws on these points as well, and, in fine, <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing one's whole life, since the mass of men are amenable to compulsion rather than Reason, and to punishment rather than to a sense of honour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  The Lacedæmonian is nearly the only State in which the framer of the Constitution has made any provision, it would seem, <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the food and manner of living of the people: in most States these points are entirely neglected, and each man lives just as he likes, ruling his wife and children Cyclops-Fashion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  Of course, the best thing would be that there should be a right Public System and that we should be able to carry it out: but, since as a public matter those points are neglected, the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> would seem to devolve upon each individual to contribute to the cause of Virtue with his own children and friends, or at least to make this his aim and purpose: and this, it would seem, from what has been said, he will be best able to do by making a Legislator of himself: since all public *[Sidenote: 1180_b_] systems, it is plain, are formed by the instrumentality of laws and those are good which are formed by that of good laws: whether they are written or unwritten, whether they are applied to the training of one or many, will not, it seems, make any difference, just as it does not in music, gymnastics, or any other such accomplishments, which are gained by practice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  It would seem then that the individual will be most exactly attended to under Private <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, because so each will be more likely to obtain what is expedient for him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of course, whether in the art of healing, or gymnastics, or any other, a man will treat individual cases the better for being acquainted with general rules; as, "that so and so is good for all, or for men in such and such cases:" because general maxims are not only said to be but are the object-matter of sciences: still this is no reason against the possibility of a man's taking excellent <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of some _one_ case, though he possesses no scientific knowledge but from experience is exactly acquainted with what happens in each point; just as some people are thought to doctor themselves best though they would be wholly unable to administer relief to others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  If then it appears that we may become good through the instrumentality of laws, of course whoso wishes to make men better by a system of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and training must try to make a Legislator of himself; for to treat skilfully just any one who may be put before you is not what any ordinary person can do, but, if any one, he who has knowledge; as in the healing art, and all others which involve <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful practice and skill.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  But of the Sophists they who profess to teach it are plainly a long way off from doing so: in fact, they have no knowledge at all of its nature and objects; if they had, they would never have put it on the same footing with Rhetoric or even on a lower: neither would they have conceived it to be "an easy matter to legislate by simply collecting such laws as are famous because of course one could select the best," as though the selection were not a matter of skill, and the judging aright a very great matter, as in Music: for they alone, who have practical knowledge of a thing, can judge the performances rightly or <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> with what means and in what way they are accomplished, and what harmonises with what: the unlearned must be content with being able to discover whether the result is good or bad, as in painting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  First then, let us endeavour to get whatever fragments of good there may be in the statements of our predecessors, next, from the Polities we have collected, ascertain what kind of things preserve or destroy Communities, and what, particular Constitutions; and the cause why some are well and others ill managed, for after such <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, we shall be the better able to take a concentrated view as to what kind of Constitution is best, what kind of regulations are best for each, and what laws and customs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>  "Principle" is a very usual signification of it, and in fact the most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Ethics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difficulty of this passage consists in determining the signification of the terms [Greek: gnorima aemin] and [Greek: gnorima aplos]  I have translated them without reference to their use elsewhere, as denoting <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively what _is_ and what _may_ be known.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> 10) to denote <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively particulars and universals The latter are so denominated, because principles or laws must be supposed to have existed before the instances of their operation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> being whether we are to assume principles, or obtain them by an analysis of facts, Aristotle says, "We must begin of course with what is known but then this term denotes either particulars or universals perhaps we then must begin with particulars and hence the necessity of a previous good training in habits, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[Greek: thesis] meant originally some paradoxical statement by any philosopher of name enough to venture on one, but had come to mean any dialectical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In spite of theory, we know as a matter of fact that external circumstances are necessary to complete the idea of Happiness not that Happiness is capable of addition, but that when we assert it to be identical with virtuous action we must <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> that it is to have a fair field; in fact, the other side of [Greek: bios teleios].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is remarkable how Aristotle here again shelves what he considers an unpractical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Happiness were really a direct gift from Heaven, independently of human conduct, all motive to self-discipline and moral <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment would vanish He shows therefore that it is no depreciation of the value of Happiness to suppose it to come partly at least from ourselves, and he then goes on with other reasons why we should think with him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the former, does he mean positive happiness (a)? or only freedom from unhappiness ([Greek: B])? _We_ cannot allow (a), Men's opinions disallow ([Greek: B]), We revert now to the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of (b).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Seeing then the actions of a servant do not need that which may be necessary for men of calling and place in the world, neither men of inferior condition many things which greater personages can hardly want; surely they are blessed in worldly <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s who have wherewith to perform what their station and place asketh, though they have no more.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, the [Greek: praxis] may be _good_ though the [Greek: pragma] be wrong, as if a man under erroneous impressions does what would have been right if his impressions had been true (subject of course to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> how far he is guiltless of his original error), but in this case we could not call the [Greek: praxis] _right_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This illustration sets in so clear a light the doctrines entertained <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively by Aristotle, Eudoxus, and the Stoics <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing pleasure, that it is worth while to go into it fully.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The old counsellors, as Helen comes upon the city wall, acknowledge her surpassing beauty, and have no difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how both nations should have incurred such suffering for her sake still, fair as she is, home she must go, that she bring not ruin on themselves and their posterity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[Greek: Aisthesis] is here used as an analogous noun, to denote the faculty which, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of moral matters, discharges the same function that bodily sense does in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of physical objects.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For by thus preserving his <strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong> for some time, his danger would lessen, since propensions, by being inured to submit, would do it more easily and of course and his security against this lessening danger would increase, since the moral principle would gain additional strength by exercise, both which things are implied in the notion of virtuous habits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Virtue is not only the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, but (by the laws of the Moral Government of the World) also the interest of Man, or to express it in Bishop Butler's manner, Conscience and Reasonable self-love are the two principles in our nature which of right have supremacy over the rest, and these two lead in point of fact the same course of action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ on objects of Moral Choice, opinion of this kind is not the same as Moral Choice, because actions alone form habits and constitute <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, opinions are in general _signs_ of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but when they begin to be acted on they cease to be opinions, and merge in Moral Choice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Suppose that three alternatives lay before a man, each of the three is of course an object of Deliberation; when he has made his choice, the alternative chosen does not cease to be in nature an object of Deliberation, but superadds the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of being chosen and so distinguished.</li>
