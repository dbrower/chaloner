<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, to speak more generally, that which is individual and has the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a unit is never predicable of a subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>, on the other hand, to those things which are present in a subject, it is generally the case that neither their name nor their definition is predicable of that in which they are present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a common <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of all sub.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For primary substance is neither present in a subject nor predicated of a subject; while, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to secondary substances, it is clear from the following arguments (apart from others) that they are not present in a subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics 'terrestrial' and 'two-footed' are predicated of the species 'man', but not present in it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, if the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic 'terrestrial' is predicated of the species 'man', the definition also of that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic may be used to form the predicate of the species 'man': for 'man' is terrestrial.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic is not peculiar to substance, but is true of many other things, such as quantity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For if the statement 'he is sitting' is true, yet, when the person in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> has risen, the same statement will be false.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But statements and opinions themselves remain unaltered in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s: it is by the alteration in the facts of the case that the contrary quality comes to be theirs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the manner in which the thing takes place, it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> or falsity of a statement depends on facts, and not on any power on the part of the statement itself of admitting contrary qualities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same is true with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the solid and to space.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similarly with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to number: what is 'three' is not more truly three than what is 'five' is five; nor is one set of three more truly three than another set.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is there any other kind of quantity, of all that have been mentioned, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to which variation of degree can be predicated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One particular <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> or one particular quality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with another in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of similarity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>habit, <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, perception, knowledge, and attitude.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For 'like' and 'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the modifications 'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of these is relative in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: for the terms 'like' and 'unequal' bear 'unequal' bear a reference to something external.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus it is essential that the correlated terms should be exactly designated; if there is a name existing, the statement will be easy; if not, it is doubtless our <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to construct names.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is likewise the case with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to perception: for the object of perception is, it appears, prior to the act of perception.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may be <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed whether it is true that no substance is relative, as seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be made in the case of certain secondary substances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to primary substances, it is quite true that there is no such possibility, for neither wholes nor parts of primary substances are relative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to some secondary substances there is a difference of opinion; thus, such terms as 'head' and 'hand' are defined with reference to that of which the things indicated are a part, and so it comes about that these appear to have a relative <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the head, the hand, and such things are substances, and it is possible to know their essential <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> definitely, but it does not necessarily follow that we should know that to which they are related.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus these are not relatives, and, this being the case, it would be true to say that no substance is relative in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is perhaps a difficult matter, in such cases, to make a positive statement without more exhaustive examination, but to have raised <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to details is not without advantage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One sort of quality let us call 'habit' or '<strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Habit differs from <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> in being more lasting and more firmly established.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The various kinds of knowledge and of virtue are habits, for knowledge, even when acquired only in a moderate degree, is, it is agreed, abiding in its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and difficult to displace, unless some great mental upheaval takes place, through disease or any such cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By a <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is easily changed and quickly gives place to its opposite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, heat, cold, disease, health, and so on are <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it is with all other <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s also, unless through lapse of time a <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> has itself become inveterate and almost impossible to dislodge: in which case we should perhaps go so far as to call it a habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is evident that men incline to call those conditions habits which are of a more or less permanent type and difficult to displace; for those who are not retentive of knowledge, but volatile, are not said to have such and such a 'habit' as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s knowledge, yet they are disposed, we may say, either better or worse, towards knowledge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus habit differs from <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> in this, that while the latter in ephemeral, the former is permanent and difficult to alter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Habits are at the same time <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s, but <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s are not necessarily habits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such things are not predicated of a person in virtue of his <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, but in virtue of his inborn capacity or incapacity to do something with ease or to avoid defeat of any kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Persons are called good boxers or good runners, not in virtue of such and such a <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, but in virtue of an inborn capacity to accomplish something with ease.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similarly with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to softness and hardness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the same <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of bodily elements, which in the former instance was momentarily present in the case of an access of shame, might be a result of a man's natural <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>, so as to produce the corresponding colouring also as a natural <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Because it is triangular or quadrangular a thing is said to have a specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, or again because it is straight or curved; in fact a thing's shape in every case gives rise to a qualification of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are some cases, however, in which, as the quality under <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> has no name, it is impossible that those possessed of it should have a name that is derivative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such a science is classed as a <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; it has a name, and is called 'boxing' or 'wrestling' as the case may be, and the name given to those disposed in this way is derived from that of the science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sometimes, even though a name exists for the quality, that which takes its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the quality has a name that is not a derivative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, the upright man takes his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the possession of the quality of <strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong>, but the name given him is not derived from the word '<strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong>'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For if we should say that justice admitted of variation of degree, difficulties might ensue, and this is true with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to all those qualities which are <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They maintain that justice and health cannot very well admit of variation of degree themselves, but that people vary in the degree in which they possess these qualities, and that this is the case with grammatical learning and all those qualities which are classed as <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whereas none of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics I have mentioned are peculiar to quality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness can be predicated with reference to quality only, gives to that category its distinctive feature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We did say that habits and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s were relative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So much, then, is stated with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to these categories.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, in those contraries with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to which no such necessity obtains, we find an intermediate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We say that that is capable of some particular faculty or possession has suffered privation when the faculty or possession in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is in no way present in that in which, and at the time at which, it should naturally be present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For it is not necessary that a subject receptive of the qualities should always have either the one or the other; that which has not yet <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d to the state when sight is natural is not said either to be blind or to see.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The bad man, if he is being brought into a better way of life and thought, may make some <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>, however slight, and if he should once <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>, even ever so little, it is plain that he might change completely, or at any rate make very great progress; for a man becomes more and more easily moved to virtue, however small the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment was at first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case is the same, of course, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as 'sight' and 'blindness'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In short, where there is no sort of combination of words, <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and falsity have no place, and all the opposites we have mentioned so far consist of simple words.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the same time, when the words which enter into opposed statements are contraries, these, more than any other set of opposites, would seem to claim this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact of the being of a man carries with it the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the proposition that he is, and the implication is reciprocal: for if a man is, the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, and conversely, if the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, then he is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The true proposition, however, is in no way the cause of the being of the man, but the fact of the man's being does seem somehow to be the cause of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the proposition, for the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> or falsity of the proposition depends on the fact of the man's being or not being.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is the case with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the double and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if there is a double, there is also a half, and if there is a half, there is also a double, while at the same time neither is the cause of the being of the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the first place it is used with reference to habit or <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> or any other quality, for we are said to 'have' a piece of knowledge or a virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is used, moreover, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to apparel, a man being said to 'have' a coat or tunic; or in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of something which we have on a part of ourselves, as a ring on the hand: or in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of something which is a part of us, as hand or foot.</li>
