<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work "light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;" and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing his manner of appearance on this earth.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This work contains hardly any original facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to man; but as the conclusions at which I arrived, after drawing up a rough draft, appeared to me interesting, I thought that they might interest others.</li>

We shall see that all these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, as indeed is obvious in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to most of them, must be answered in the affirmative, in the same manner as with the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s just referred to may be conveniently deferred for a time: and we will first see how far the bodily structure of man shews traces, more or less plain, of his descent from some lower form.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The former are either absolutely useless, such as the mammae of male quadrupeds, or the incisor teeth of ruminants which never cut through the gums; or they are of such slight <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to their present possessors, that we can hardly suppose that they were developed under the conditions which now exist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nascent organs, on the other hand, though not fully developed, are of high <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to their possessors, and are capable of further development.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The power of erecting and directing the shell of the ears to the various points of the compass, is no doubt of the highest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to many animals, as they thus perceive the direction of danger; but I have never heard, on sufficient evidence, of a man who possessed this power, the one which might be of use to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was thus led to examine the ears of various monkeys, and subsequently more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully those of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole, it still seems to me probable that the points in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> are in some cases, both in man and apes, vestiges of a former condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the sense of smell is of extremely slight <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, if any, even to the dark coloured races of men, in whom it is much more highly developed than in the white and civilised races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He inherits the power in an enfeebled and so far rudimentary condition, from some early progenitor, to whom it was highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, and by whom it was continually used.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In those animals which have this sense highly developed, such as dogs and horses, the recollection of persons and of places is strongly associated with their odour; and we can thus perhaps <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is, as Dr.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Brandt informs me that he has compared the hair from the face of a man thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, aged thirty-five, with the lanugo of a foetus, and finds it quite similar in texture; therefore, as he remarks, the case may be attributed to an arrest of development in the hair, together with its continued growth.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reproductive system offers various rudimentary structures; but these differ in one important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> from the foregoing cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In man this organ is only from three to six lines in length, but, like so many other rudimentary parts, it is variable in development as well as in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In only a few cases does he discuss rudiments, and then only those parts which are partially rudimentary, such as the little hoofs of the pig and ox, which do not touch the ground; these he shews clearly to be of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to development, we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on the principle of variations supervening at a rather late embryonic period, and being inherited at a corresponding period, how it is that the embryos of <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully different forms should still retain, more or less perfectly, the structure of their common progenitor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No other explanation has ever been given of the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous fact that the embryos of a man, dog, seal, bat, reptile, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the existence of rudimentary organs, we have only to suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> in a perfect state, and that under changed habits of life they became greatly reduced, either from simple disuse, or through the natural selection of those individuals which were least encumbered with a superfluous part, aided by the other means previously indicated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it has come to pass that man and all other vertebrate animals have been constructed on the same general model, why they pass through the same early stages of development, and why they retain certain rudiments in common.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the time will before long come, when it will be thought <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that naturalists, who were well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man, and other mammals, should have believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the "Cranial forms of the American aborigines," see Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Brehm especially insists that each individual monkey of those which he kept tame in Africa had its own peculiar <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and temper: he mentions one baboon remarkable for its high intelligence; and the keepers in the Zoological Gardens pointed out to me a monkey, belonging to the New World division, equally remarkable for intelligence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rengger, also, insists on the diversity in the various mental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the monkeys of the same species which he kept in Paraguay; and this diversity, as he adds, is partly innate, and partly the result of the manner in which they have been treated or educated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A greater number of facts have been collected with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the transmission of the most trifling, as well as of the most important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in man, than in any of the lower animals; though the facts are copious enough with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the latter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to mental qualities, their transmission is manifest in our dogs, horses, and other domestic animals.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), that genius which implies a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully complex combination of high faculties, tends to be inherited; and, on the other hand, it is too certain that insanity and deteriorated mental powers likewise run in families.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the causes of variability, we are in all cases very ignorant; but we can see that in man as in the lower animals, they stand in some relation to the conditions to which each species has been exposed, during several generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> the different races of man resemble domesticated animals, and so do the individuals of the same race, when inhabiting a very wide area, like that of America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the influence of diversified conditions in the more civilised nations; for the members belonging to different grades of rank, and following different occupations, present a greater range of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than do the members of barbarous nations.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In another and much more important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, man differs widely from any strictly domesticated animal; for his breeding has never long been controlled, either by methodical or unconscious selection.</li>

If then in outward manner, form, and mind, You find us a degraded, motley kind, Wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain, And to lament the consequence is vain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a well-known law that widely-ranging species are much more variable than species with restricted ranges; and the variability of man may with more <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> be compared with that of widely- ranging species, than with that of domesticated animals.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Mongolians of the plains of northern Asia, according to Pallas, have <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully perfect senses; and Prichard believes that the great breadth of their skulls across the zygomas follows from their highly-developed sense organs.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Forbes found a few pure families which had survived during two generations: and he observed that they still inherited their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic peculiarities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Although man may not have been much modified during the latter stages of his existence through the increased or decreased use of parts, the facts now given shew that his liability in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> has not been lost; and we positively know that the same law holds good with the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Idiots also resemble the lower animals in some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s; thus several cases are recorded of their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully smelling every mouthful of food before eating it.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, according to the opinion lately <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Laurillard remarks, that as he has found a complete similarity in the form, proportions, and connection of the two malar bones in several human subjects and in certain apes, he cannot consider this <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the parts as simply accidental.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this, and other instances presently to be given, the cause of ancient races approaching the lower animals in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s more frequently than do the modern races, appears to be, that the latter stand at a somewhat greater distance in the long line of descent from their early semi-human progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Various other anomalies in man, more or less analogous to the foregoing, have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by different authors, as cases of reversion; but these seem not a little doubtful, for we have to descend extremely low in the mammalian series, before we find such structures normally present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why should not variations occur during an early period of development, having no relation to reversion; yet such variations might be preserved and accumulated, if in any way <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, for instance, in shortening and simplifying the course of development? And again, why should not injurious abnormalities, such as atrophied or hypertrophied parts, which have no relation to a former state of existence, occur at an early period, as well as during maturity?) In man, the canine teeth are perfectly efficient instruments for mastication.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Professor Schaaffhausen first drew attention to the relation apparently existing between a muscular frame and the strongly-pronounced supra-orbital ridges, which are so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the lower races of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also probable that the increased fertility of civilised nations would become, as with our domestic animals, an inherited <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: it is at least known that with mankind a tendency to produce twins runs in families.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One can hardly doubt, that a man-like animal who possessed a hand and arm sufficiently perfect to throw a stone with <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, or to form a flint into a rude tool, could, with sufficient practice, as far as mechanical skill alone is concerned, make almost anything which a civilised man can make.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The structure of the hand in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> may be compared with that of the vocal organs, which in the apes are used for uttering various signal-cries, or, as in one genus, musical cadences; but in man the closely similar vocal organs have become adapted through the inherited effects of use for the utterance of articulate language.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They roll down stones, or throw them at their enemies: nevertheless, they are clumsy in these various actions, and, as I have myself seen, are quite unable to throw a stone with <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may suspect that a hand as perfect as that of man would have been disadvantageous for climbing; for the most arboreal monkeys in the world, namely, Ateles in America, Colobus in Africa, and Hylobates in Asia, are either t<strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>ss, or their toes partially cohere, so that their limbs are converted into mere grasping hooks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It deserves notice that the feet of the sloths, the most arboreal animals in the world, are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully hook- like.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man alone has become a biped; and we can, I think, partly see how he has come to assume his erect attitude, which forms one of his most conspicuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the gorilla and a few allied forms had become extinct, it might have been argued, with great force and apparent <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that an animal could not have been gradually converted from a quadruped into a biped, as all the individuals in an intermediate condition would have been miserably ill-fitted for progression.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt these means of change often co-operate: thus when certain muscles, and the crests of bone to which they are attached, become enlarged by habitual use, this shews that certain actions are habitually performed and must be <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activity with an extremely small absolute mass of nervous matter: thus the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully diversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of ants are notorious, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a small pin's head.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several facts we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, to a certain extent, the means by which the great size and more or less rounded form of the skull have been acquired by man; and these are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s eminently distinctive of him in comparison with the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The view which seems to me the most probable is that man, or rather primarily woman, became divested of hair for ornamental purposes, as we shall see under Sexual Selection; and, according to this belief, it is not surprising that man should differ so greatly in hairiness from all other Primates, for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, gained through sexual selection, often differ to an extraordinary degree in closely related forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed this species in the Zoological Gardens, as well as three other closely allied forms with slightly longer tails, says that when the animal sits down, the tail "is necessarily thrust to one side of the buttocks; and whether long or short its root is consequently liable to be rubbed or chafed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have now endeavoured to shew that some of the most distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of man have in all probability been acquired, either directly, or more commonly indirectly, through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must not, however, be too confident in deciding what modifications are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to each being: we should remember how little we know about the use of many parts, or what changes in the blood or tissues may serve to fit an organism for a new climate or new kinds of food.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also well to reflect on such facts, as the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful growth of galls on plants caused by the poison of an insect, and on the remarkable changes of colour in the plumage of parrots when fed on certain fishes, or inoculated with the poison of toads (95.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus a large yet undefined extension may safely be given to the direct and indirect results of natural selection; but I now admit, after reading the essay by Nageli on plants, and the remarks by various authors with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to animals, more especially those recently made by Professor Broca, that in the earlier editions of my 'Origin of Species' I perhaps attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the survival of the fittest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was not, however, able to annul the influence of my former belief, then almost universal, that each species had been purposely created; and this led to my tacit assumption that every detail of structure, excepting rudiments, was of some special, though unrecognised, <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of those who admit the principle of evolution, but reject natural selection, seem to forget, when criticising my book, that I had the above two objects in view; hence if I have erred in giving to natural selection great power, which I am very far from admitting, or in having exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, as I hope, done good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, as I can now see, probable that all organic beings, including man, possess peculiarities of structure, which neither are now, nor were formerly of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them, and which, therefore, are of no physiological importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Uniformity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would, however, naturally follow from the assumed uniformity of the exciting causes, and likewise from the free intercrossing of many individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the exciting causes we can only say, as when speaking of so-called spontaneous variations, that they relate much more closely to the constitution of the varying organism, than to the nature of the conditions to which it has been subjected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears, also, as we shall hereafter see, that various unimportant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been acquired by man through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Associated insects have thus acquired many remarkable structures, which are of little or no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the individual, such as the pollen-collecting apparatus, or the sting of the worker-bee, or the great jaws of soldier-ants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the higher social animals, I am not aware that any structure has been modified solely for the good of the community, though some are of secondary <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to certain mental powers the case, as we shall see in the fifth chapter, is wholly different; for these faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively, gained for the benefit of the community, and the individuals thereof have at the same time gained an advantage indirectly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It has often been objected to such views as the foregoing, that man is one of the most <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less and defenceless creatures in the world; and that during his early and less well-developed condition, he would have been still more <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) that "the human frame has diverged from the structure of brutes, in the direction of greater physical <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>lessness and weakness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to bodily size or strength, we do not know whether man is descended from some small species, like the chimpanzee, or from one as powerful as the gorilla; and, therefore, we cannot say whether man has become larger and stronger, or smaller and weaker, than his ancestors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We should, however, bear in mind that an animal possessing great size, strength, and ferocity, and which, like the gorilla, could defend itself from all enemies, would not perhaps have become social: and this would most effectually have checked the acquirement of the higher mental qualities, such as <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and the love of his fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ancestors of man were, no doubt, inferior in intellect, and probably in social <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, to the lowest existing savages; but it is quite conceivable that they might have existed, or even flourished, if they had <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in intellect, whilst gradually losing their brute-like powers, such as that of climbing trees, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But these ancestors would not have been exposed to any special danger, even if far more <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less and defenceless than any existing savages, had they inhabited some warm continent or large island, such as Australia, New Guinea, or Borneo, which is now the home of the orang.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference in mental power between the highest ape and the lowest savage, immense--Certain instincts in common--The emotions--Curiosity-- Imitation--Attention--Memory--Imagination--Reason--Progressive <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment --Tools and weapons used by animals--Abstraction, Self-consciousness-- Language--Sense of beauty--Belief in God, spiritual agencies, superstitions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt the difference in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> is enormous, even if we compare the mind of one of the lowest savages, who has no words to express any number higher than four, and who uses hardly any abstract terms for common objects or for the affections (1.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference would, no doubt, still remain immense, even if one of the higher apes had been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d or civilised as much as a dog has been in comparison with its parent-form, the wolf or jackal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Beagle," who had lived some years in England, and could talk a little English, resembled us in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and in most of our mental faculties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is the difference slight in moral <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> between a barbarian, such as the man described by the old navigator Byron, who dashed his child on the rocks for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a Howard or Clarkson; and in intellect, between a savage who uses hardly any abstract terms, and a Newton or Shakspeare.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to animals very low in the scale, I shall give some additional facts under Sexual Selection, shewing that their mental powers are much higher than might have been expected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it would be superfluous to enter into many details on this head, for I have found on frequent enquiry, that it is the unanimous opinion of all those who have long attended to animals of many kinds, including birds, that the individuals differ greatly in every mental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those insects which possess the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instincts are certainly the most intelligent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am, however, very far from wishing to deny that instinctive actions may lose their fixed and untaught <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and be replaced by others performed by the aid of the free will.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These actions may then be said to be degraded in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for they are no longer performed through reason or from experience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can, I think, come to no other conclusion with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of the more complex instincts, when we reflect on the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous instincts of sterile worker- ants and bees, which leave no offspring to inherit the effects of experience and of modified habits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although, as we learn from the above-mentioned insects and the beaver, a high degree of intelligence is certainly compatible with complex instincts, and although actions, at first learnt voluntarily can soon through habit be performed with the quickness and <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> of a reflex action, yet it is not improbable that there is a certain amount of interference between the development of free intelligence and of instinct,--which latter implies some inherited modification of the brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have thought this digression worth giving, because we may easily underrate the mental powers of the higher animals, and especially of man, when we compare their actions founded on the memory of past events, on foresight, reason, and <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, with exactly similar actions instinctively performed by the lower animals; in this latter case the capacity of performing such actions has been gained, step by step, through the variability of the mental organs and natural selection, without any conscious intelligence on the part of the animal during each successive generation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has to learn his work by practice; a beaver, on the other hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well, or nearly as well, and a spider its <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful web, quite as well (6.</li>

We see maternal affection exhibited in the most trifling details; thus Rengger observed an American monkey (a Cebus) <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully driving away the flies which plagued her infant; and Duvaucel saw a Hylobates washing the faces of her young ones in a stream.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Orphan monkeys were always adopted and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully guarded by the other monkeys, both males and females.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The savage would certainly neither know nor <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> by what law the desired movements were effected; yet his act would be guided by a rude process of reasoning, as surely as would a philosopher in his longest chain of deductions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rengger, a most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, states that when he first gave eggs to his monkeys in Paraguay, they smashed them, and thus lost much of their contents; afterwards they gently hit one end against some hard body, and picked off the bits of shell with their fingers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how anybody who has ever kept a dog, or seen an elephant, can have any doubt as to an animal's power of performing the essential processes of reasoning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All have the same senses, intuitions, and sensations,--similar passions, affections, and emotions, even the more complex ones, such as jealousy, suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and magnanimity; they practise deceit and are revengeful; they are sometimes susceptible to ridicule, and even have a sense of humour; they feel <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> and curiosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation, attention, deliberation, choice, memory, <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, the association of ideas, and reason, though in very different degrees.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That which distinguishes man from the lower animals is not the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of articulate sounds, for, as every one knows, dogs <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> many words and sentences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they are at the same stage of development as infants, between the ages of ten and twelve months, who <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> many words and short sentences, but cannot yet utter a single word.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not the mere articulation which is our distinguishing <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for parrots and other birds possess this power.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sulivan, whom I know to be a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, assures me that an African parrot, long kept in his father's house, invariably called certain persons of the household, as well as visitors, by their names.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He observes that the desire of communication between man is the living force, which, in the development of language, "works both consciously and unconsciously; consciously as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the immediate end to be attained; unconsciously as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the further consequences of the act.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>") The sounds uttered by birds offer in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the nearest analogy to language, for all the members of the same species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of their emotions; and all the kinds which sing, exert their power instinctively; but the actual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or foster-parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of articulate language, after having read on the one side the highly interesting works of Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to savages, I have given some facts in my 'Journal of Researches,' etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since monkeys certainly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> much that is said to them by man, and when wild, utter signal-cries of danger to their fellows (57.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) There is no more improbability in the continued use of the mental and vocal organs leading to inherited changes in their structure and functions, than in the case of hand-writing, which depends partly on the form of the hand and partly on the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the mind; and handwriting is certainly inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" What a strange definition must here be given to the word thought!) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to animals, I have already endeavoured to shew that they have this power, at least in a rude and incipient degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the capacity to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> is as good a proof of vocal intelligence, though in an inferior degree, as the capacity to speak.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all the higher mammals possess vocal organs, constructed on the same general plan as ours, and used as a means of communication, it was obviously probable that these same organs would be still further developed if the power of communication had to be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; and this has been effected by the aid of adjoining and well adapted parts, namely the tongue and lips.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The fact of the higher apes not using their vocal organs for speech, no doubt depends on their intelligence not having been sufficiently <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) If it be asked why apes have not had their intellects developed to the same degree as that of man, general causes only can be assigned in answer, and it is unreasonable to expect any thing more definite, considering our ignorance with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the successive stages of development through which each creature has passed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" But not only can we partially <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that man is from various conflicting influences rendered capricious, but that the lower animals are, as we shall hereafter see, likewise capricious in their affections, aversions, and sense of beauty.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as the important faculties of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, and curiosity, together with some power of reasoning, had become partially developed, man would naturally crave to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what was passing around him, and would have vaguely speculated on his own existence.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most common mutual <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in the higher animals is to warn one another of danger by means of the united senses of all.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Social animals perform many little <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s for each other: horses nibble, and cows lick each other, on any spot which itches: monkeys search each other for external parasites; and Brehm states that after a troop of the Cercopithecus griseo-viridis has rushed through a thorny brake, each monkey stretches itself on a branch, and another monkey sitting by, "conscientiously" examines its fur, and extracts every thorn or burr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Animals also render more important <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s to one another: thus wolves and some other beasts of prey hunt in packs, and aid one another in attacking their victims.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot resist giving another scene which was witnessed by this same naturalist; an eagle seized a young Cercopithecus, which, by clinging to a branch, was not at once carried off; it cried loudly for <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, upon which the other members of the troop, with much uproar, rushed to the rescue, surrounded the eagle, and pulled out so many feathers, that he no longer thought of his prey, but only how to escape.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How far in most cases they actually sympathise in the pains and pleasures of others, is more doubtful, especially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pleasures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That animals sometimes are far from feeling any <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is too certain; for they will expel a wounded animal from the herd, or gore or worry it to death.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bain states, "effective aid to a sufferer springs from <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> proper:" 'Mental and Moral Science,' 1868, p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must be called <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> that leads a courageous dog to fly at any one who strikes his master, as he certainly will.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must have been <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> in the cases above given which led the baboons and Cercopitheci to defend their young comrades from the dogs and the eagle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides love and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, animals exhibit other qualities connected with the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; and I agree with Agassiz (16.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This forbearance under an emergency so dreadful for a heavy animal, is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful proof of noble fidelity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The men who break in these animals for harness, watch assiduously for those who, by grazing apart, shew a self-reliant <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and these they train as fore-oxen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the impulse which leads certain animals to associate together, and to aid one another in many ways, we may infer that in most cases they are impelled by the same sense of satisfaction or pleasure which they experience in performing other instinctive actions; or by the same sense of dissatisfaction as when other instinctive actions are checked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see this in innumerable instances, and it is illustrated in a striking manner by the acquired instincts of our domesticated animals; thus a young shepherd-dog delights in driving and running round a flock of sheep, but not in worrying them; a young fox-hound delights in hunting a fox, whilst some other kinds of dogs, as I have witnessed, utterly dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> foxes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A young pointer, when it first scents game, apparently cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> pointing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With those animals which were benefited by living in close association, the individuals which took the greatest pleasure in society would best escape various dangers, whilst those that <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d least for their comrades, and lived solitary, would perish in greater numbers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of the parental and filial affections, which apparently lie at the base of the social instincts, we know not the steps by which they have been gained; but we may infer that it has been to a large extent through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it has almost certainly been with the unusual and opposite feeling of hatred between the nearest relations, as with the worker-bees which kill their brother drones, and with the queen-bees which kill their daughter-queens; the desire to destroy their nearest relations having been in this case of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the community.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The all-important emotion of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is distinct from that of love.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A mother may passionately love her sleeping and passive infant, but she can hardly at such times be said to feel <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The love of a man for his dog is distinct from <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, and so is that of a dog for his master.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bain recently, that the basis of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> lies in our strong retentiveness of former states of pain or pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bain states, that, "<strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is, indirectly, a source of pleasure to the sympathiser"; and he accounts for this through reciprocity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He remarks that "the person benefited, or others in his stead, may make up, by <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and good offices returned, for all the sacrifice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" But if, as appears to be the case, <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is strictly an instinct, its exercise would give direct pleasure, in the same manner as the exercise, as before remarked, of almost every other instinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) But I cannot see how this view explains the fact that <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is excited, in an immeasurably stronger degree, by a beloved, than by an indifferent person.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The explanation may lie in the fact that, with all animals, <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is directed solely towards the members of the same community, and therefore towards known, and more or less beloved members, but not to all the individuals of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Species which are not social, such as lions and tigers, no doubt feel <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for the suffering of their own young, but not for that of any other animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bain has shewn, to the power of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>; for we are led by the hope of receiving good in return to perform acts of sympathetic kindness to others; and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is much strengthened by habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, impossible to decide in many cases whether certain social instincts have been acquired through natural selection, or are the indirect result of other instincts and faculties, such as <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, reason, experience, and a tendency to imitation; or again, whether they are simply the result of long-continued habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, the habit followed by the males of some social animals of defending the community, and of attacking their enemies or their prey in concert, may perhaps have originated from mutual <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>; but courage, and in most cases strength, must have been previously acquired, probably through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence a struggle may often be observed in animals between different instincts, or between an instinct and some habitual <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; as when a dog rushes after a hare, is rebuked, pauses, hesitates, pursues again, or returns ashamed to his master; or as between the love of a female dog for her young puppies and for her master,--for she may be seen to slink away to them, as if half ashamed of not accompanying her master.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The former is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully strong; a confined bird will at the proper season beat her breast against the wires of her cage, until it is bare and bloody.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer examined, late in the autumn, during two years, thirty-six nests; he found that twelve contained young dead birds, five contained eggs on the point of being hatched, and three, eggs not nearly hatched.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although man, as he now exists, has few special instincts, having lost any which his early progenitors may have possessed, this is no reason why he should not have retained from an extremely remote period some degree of instinctive love and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for his fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>throws a melancholy damp over the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The social animals which stand at the bottom of the scale are guided almost exclusively, and those which stand higher in the scale are largely guided, by special instincts in the aid which they give to the members of the same community; but they are likewise in part impelled by mutual love and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ed apparently by some amount of reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although man, as just remarked, has no special instincts to tell him how to aid his fellow- men, he still has the impulse, and with his <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d intellectual faculties would naturally be much guided in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> by reason and experience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Instinctive <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> would also cause him to value highly the approbation of his fellows; for, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), the love of praise and the strong feeling of glory, and the still stronger horror of scorn and infamy, "are due to the workings of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as love, <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and self-command become strengthened by habit, and as the power of reasoning becomes clearer, so that man can value justly the judgments of his fellows, he will feel himself impelled, apart from any transitory pleasure or pain, to certain lines of conduct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have not, however, as yet considered the main point, on which, from our present point of view, the whole <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the moral sense turns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless many a civilised man, or even boy, who never before risked his life for another, but full of courage and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, has dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed the instinct of self-preservation, and plunged at once into a torrent to save a drowning man, though a stranger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who is forced to overcome his fear or want of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> before he acts, deserves, however, in one way higher credit than the man whose innate <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> leads him to a good act without effort.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in the case of man, who alone can with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> be ranked as a moral being, actions of a certain class are called moral, whether performed deliberately, after a struggle with opposing motives, or impulsively through instinct, or from the effects of slowly-gained habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why then does man regret, even though trying to banish such regret, that he has followed the one natural impulse rather than the other; and why does he further feel that he ought to regret his conduct? Man in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> differs profoundly from the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such animals are always ready to utter the danger-signal, to defend the community, and to give aid to their fellows in accordance with their habits; they feel at all times, without the stimulus of any special passion or desire, some degree of love and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for them; they are unhappy if long separated from them, and always happy to be again in their company.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even when we are quite alone, how often do we think with pleasure or pain of what others think of us,--of their imagined approbation or disapprobation; and this all follows from <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, a fundamental element of the social instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The wish for another man's property is perhaps as persistent a desire as any that can be named; but even in this case the satisfaction of actual possession is generally a weaker feeling than the desire: many a thief, if not a habitual one, after success has <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed why he stole some article.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is necessary that these instincts, together with <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, should have been highly cultivated and extended by the aid of reason, instruction, and the love or fear of God, before any such golden rule would ever be thought of and obeyed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) A man cannot prevent past impressions often repassing through his mind; he will thus be driven to make a comparison between the impressions of past hunger, vengeance satisfied, or danger shunned at other men's cost, with the almost ever-present instinct of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, and with his early knowledge of what others consider as praiseworthy or blameable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This knowledge cannot be banished from his mind, and from instinctive <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed of great moment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But after their gratification when past and weaker impressions are judged by the ever-enduring social instinct, and by his deep <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the good opinion of his fellows, retribution will surely come.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How far each man values the appreciation of others, depends on the strength of his innate or acquired feeling of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>; and on his own capacity for reasoning out the remote consequences of his acts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Another element is most important, although not necessary, the <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> or fear of the Gods, or Spirits believed in by each man: and this applies especially in cases of remorse.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is put in either district, is it worse to kill a girl of a foreign tribe, or to marry a girl of one's own, an answer just opposite to ours would be given without hesitation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If they fail to do so, they fail in their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> and act wrongly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If any desire or instinct leading to an action opposed to the good of others still appears, when recalled to mind, as strong as, or stronger than, the social instinct, a man will feel no keen regret at having followed it; but he will be conscious that if his conduct were known to his fellows, it would meet with their disapprobation; and few are so destitute of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> as not to feel discomfort when this is realised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If he has no such <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, and if his desires leading to bad actions are at the time strong, and when recalled are not over-mastered by the persistent social instincts, and the judgment of others, then he is essentially a bad man (30.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>); and the sole restraining motive left is the fear of punishment, and the conviction that in the long run it would be best for his own selfish interests to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the good of others rather than his own.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Prudence, on the other hand, which does not concern the welfare of others, though a very useful virtue, has never been highly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The other so-called self-<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing virtues, which do not obviously, though they may really, affect the welfare of the tribe, have never been <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed by savages, though now highly appreciated by civilised nations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have now seen that actions are <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by savages, and were probably so <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by primeval man, as good or bad, solely as they obviously affect the welfare of the tribe,--not that of the species, nor that of an individual member of the tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The chief causes of the low morality of savages, as judged by our standard, are, firstly, the confinement of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> to the same tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondly, powers of reasoning insufficient to recognise the bearing of many virtues, especially of the self-<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing virtues, on the general welfare of the tribe.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the latter theory the standard and the motive of conduct have no doubt often been confused, but they are really in some degree blended.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have seen that even at an early period in the history of man, the expressed wishes of the community will have naturally influenced to a large extent the conduct of each member; and as all wish for happiness, the "greatest happiness principle" will have become a most important secondary guide and object; the social instinct, however, together with <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> (which leads to our <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing the approbation and disapprobation of others), having served as the primary impulse and guide.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither can we say why certain admirable virtues, such as the love of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, are much more highly appreciated by some savage tribes than by others (43.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Knowing how firmly fixed many strange customs and superstitions have become, we need feel no surprise that the self- <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing virtues, supported as they are by reason, should now appear to us so natural as to be thought innate, although they were not valued by man in his early condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As man <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s in civilisation, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sympathy beyond the confines of man, that is, humanity to the lower animals, seems to be one of the latest moral acquisitions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As Marcus Aurelius long ago said, "Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" There is not the least inherent improbability, as it seems to me, in virtuous tendencies being more or less strongly inherited; for, not to mention the various <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s and habits transmitted by many of our domestic animals to their offspring, I have heard of authentic cases in which a desire to steal and a tendency to lie appeared to run in families of the upper ranks; and as stealing is a rare crime in the wealthy classes, we can hardly account by accidental coincidence for the tendency occurring in two or three members of the same family.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Except through the principle of the transmission of moral tendencies, we cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the differences believed to exist in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> between the various races of mankind.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My chief source of doubt with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to any such inheritance, is that senseless customs, superstitions, and tastes, such as the horror of a Hindoo for unclean food, ought on the same principle to be transmitted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally the social instincts, which no doubt were acquired by man as by the lower animals for the good of the community, will from the first have given to him some wish to aid his fellows, some feeling of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, and have compelled him to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> their approbation and disapprobation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as man gradually <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in intellectual power, and was enabled to trace the more remote consequences of his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs and superstitions; as he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed more and more, not only the welfare, but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from habit, following on beneficial experience, instruction and example, his sympathies became more tender and widely diffused, extending to men of all races, to the imbecile, maimed, and other useless members of society, and finally to the lower animals,--so would the standard of his morality rise higher and higher.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Obscure as is the problem of the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of civilisation, we can at least see that a nation which produced during a lengthened period the greatest number of highly intellectual, energetic, brave, patriotic, and benevolent men, would generally prevail over less favoured nations.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Judging from all that we know of man and the lower animals, there has always been sufficient variability in their intellectual and moral faculties, for a steady <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> through natural selection.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why a classification founded on any single <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> or organ--even an organ so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully complex and important as the brain--or on the high development of the mental faculties, is almost sure to prove unsatisfactory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Classifications may, of course, be based on any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> whatever, as on size, colour, or the element inhabited; but naturalists have long felt a profound conviction that there is a natural system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we can see how it is that resemblances in several unimportant structures, in useless and rudimentary organs, or not now functionally active, or in an embryological condition, are by far the most <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able for classification; for they can hardly be due to adaptations within a late period; and thus they reveal the old lines of descent or of true affinity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can further see why a great amount of modification in some one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> ought not to lead us to separate widely any two organisms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The greater number of naturalists who have taken into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The family of Seals offers a good illustration of the small importance of adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s for classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace, who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully studied the habits of the orang, remarks that the convergence of the hair towards the elbow on the arms of the orang may be explained as serving to throw off the rain, for this animal during rainy weather sits with its arms bent, and with the hands clasped round a branch or over its head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would, however, be rash to trust too much to the principle of adaptation in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the direction of the hair in man or his early progenitors; for it is impossible to study the figures given by Eschricht of the arrangement of the hair on the human foetus (this being the same as in the adult) and not agree with this excellent observer that other and more complex causes have intervened.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the similar direction of the hair on the fore-arms of man and certain monkeys, as this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is common to almost all the anthropomorphous apes, it may probably be attributed to inheritance; but this is not certain, as some very distinct American monkeys are thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This family is divided by almost all naturalists into the Catarrhine group, or Old World monkeys, all of which are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised (as their name expresses) by the peculiar structure of their nostrils, and by having four premolars in each jaw; and into the Platyrrhine group or New World monkeys (including two very distinct sub- groups), all of which are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by differently constructed nostrils, and by having six premolars in each jaw.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now man un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ably belongs in his dentition, in the structure of his nostrils, and some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, to the Catarrhine or Old World division; nor does he resemble the Platyrrhines more closely than the Catarrhines in any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, excepting in a few of not much importance and apparently of an adaptive nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is therefore against all probability that some New World species should have formerly varied and produced a man-like creature, with all the distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the Old World division; losing at the same time all its own distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gaudry's <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful discoveries in Attica, that during the Miocene period a form existed there, which connected Semnopithecus and Macacus; and this probably illustrates the manner in which the other and higher groups were once blended together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the anthropomorphous apes be admitted to form a natural sub-group, then as man agrees with them, not only in all those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which he possesses in common with the whole Catarrhine group, but in other peculiar <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, such as the absence of a tail and of callosities, and in general appearance, we may infer that some ancient member of the anthropomorphous sub-group gave birth to man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not probable that, through the law of analogous variation, a member of one of the other lower sub-groups should have given rise to a man-like creature, resembling the higher anthropomorphous apes in so many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The early descendants of this progenitor, before they had diverged to any considerable extent from each other, would still have formed a single natural group; but some of the species or incipient genera would have already begun to indicate by their diverging <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s the future distinctive marks of the Catarrhine and Platyrrhine divisions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence the members of this supposed ancient group would not have been so uniform in their dentition, or in the structure of their nostrils, as are the existing Catarrhine monkeys in one way and the Platyrrhines in another way, but would have resembled in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> the allied Lemuridae, which differ greatly from each other in the form of their muzzles (15.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Catarrhine and Platyrrhine monkeys agree in a multitude of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as is shewn by their un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ably belonging to one and the same Order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which they possess in common can hardly have been independently acquired by so many distinct species; so that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s must have been inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But a naturalist would undoubtedly have ranked as an ape or a monkey, an ancient form which possessed many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s common to the Catarrhine and Platyrrhine monkeys, other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in an intermediate condition, and some few, perhaps, distinct from those now found in either group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus it may have been with man, who has undergone a great amount of modification in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in comparison with the higher apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies, which cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species, has often been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d as a grave objection to the belief that man is descended from some lower form; but this objection will not appear of much weight to those who, from general reasons, believe in the general principle of evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the absence of fossil remains, serving to connect man with his ape-like progenitors, no one will lay much stress on this fact who reads Sir C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" From these various <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s it is probable that the Simiadae were originally developed from the progenitors of the existing Lemuridae; and these in their turn from forms standing very low in the mammalian series.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>") We should then be justified in believing that at an extremely remote period a group of animals existed, resembling in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the larvae of our present Ascidians, which diverged into two great branches--the one retrograding in development and producing the present class of Ascidians, the other rising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom by giving birth to the Vertebrata.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Constancy of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is what is chiefly valued and sought for by naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whenever it can be shewn, or rendered probable, that the forms in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> have remained distinct for a long period, this becomes an argument of much weight in favour of treating them as species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Independently of fusion from intercrossing, the complete absence, in a well-investigated region, of varieties linking together any two closely- allied forms, is probably the most important of all the criterions of their specific distinctness; and this is a somewhat different <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> from mere constancy of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for two forms may be highly variable and yet not yield intermediate varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called good or true species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the amount of difference between the races, we must make some allowance for our nice powers of discrimination gained by the long habit of observing ourselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Father Ripa makes exactly the same remark with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Chinese.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, however, no doubt that the various races, when <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared and measured, differ much from each other,--as in the texture of the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body (2.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will first consider the arguments which may be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in favour of classing the races of man as distinct species, and then the arguments on the other side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If a naturalist, who had never before seen a Negro, Hottentot, Australian, or Mongolian, were to compare them, he would at once perceive that they differed in a multitude of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, some of slight and some of considerable importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On enquiry he would find that they were adapted to live under widely different climates, and that they differed somewhat in bodily constitution and mental <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This conclusion would be greatly strengthened as soon as he had ascertained that these forms had all retained the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> for many centuries; and that negroes, apparently identical with existing negroes, had lived at least 4000 years ago.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, he resembles the other members of his class.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Murray has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined the Pediculi collected in different countries from the different races of man (8.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With insects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be classed as distinct species.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s may be compared with those animals which have long been domesticated, and a large body of evidence can be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in favour of the Pallasian doctrine (14.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, it may be justly urged that the perfect fertility of the intercrossed races of man, if established, would not absolutely preclude us from ranking them as distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Independently of fertility, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s presented by the offspring from a cross have been thought to indicate whether or not the parent-forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties; but after <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully studying the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that no general rules of this kind can be trusted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is especially apt to occur when the parents differ in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which first appeared as sudden variations or monstrosities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other side of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, if our supposed naturalist were to enquire whether the forms of man keep distinct like ordinary species, when mingled together in large numbers in the same country, he would immediately discover that this was by no means the case.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) This diversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every naturalist who has had the misfortune to undertake the description of a group of highly varying organisms, has encountered cases (I speak after experience) precisely like that of man; and if of a cautious <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, he will end by uniting all the forms which graduate into each other, under a single species; for he will say to himself that he has no right to give names to objects which he cannot define.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cases of this kind occur in the Order which includes man, namely in certain genera of monkeys; whilst in other genera, as in Cercopithecus, most of the species can be determined with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now if numerous specimens of Cebus were collected from all parts of South America, and those forms which at present appear to be specifically distinct, were found to graduate into each other by close steps, they would usually be ranked as mere varieties or races; and this course has been followed by most naturalists with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the races of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nageli has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully described several striking cases in his 'Botanische Mittheilungen,' B.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some naturalists have lately employed the term "sub-species" to designate forms which possess many of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of true species, but which hardly deserve so high a rank.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much discussed by anthropologists, who are divided into the two schools of monogenists and polygenists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have a practical illustration of the difficulty in the never-ending doubts whether many closely-allied mammals, birds, insects, and plants, which represent each other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively in North America and Europe, should be ranked as species or geographical races; and the like holds true of the productions of many islands situated at some little distance from the nearest continent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With our domestic animals the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the various races have arisen from one or more species is somewhat different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although it may be admitted that all the races, as well as all the natural species within the same genus, have sprung from the same primitive stock, yet it is a fit subject for discussion, whether all the domestic races of the dog, for instance, have acquired their present amount of difference since some one species was first domesticated by man; or whether they owe some of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to inheritance from distinct species, which had already been differentiated in a state of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With man no such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> can arise, for he cannot be said to have been domesticated at any particular period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During an early stage in the divergence of the races of man from a common stock, the differences between the races and their number must have been small; consequently as far as their distinguishing <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are concerned, they then had less claim to rank as distinct species than the existing so-called races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is however possible, though far from probable, that the early progenitors of man might formerly have diverged much in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, until they became more unlike each other than any now existing races; but that subsequently, as suggested by Vogt (22.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), they converged in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to cattle, see M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), with the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds of the pig, which are descended from two distinct species; and in a less marked manner with the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds of cattle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this conclusion, which rests almost exclusively on brain-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, be admitted, we should have a case of convergence at least in external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, for the anthropomorphous apes are certainly more like each other in many points, than they are to other apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would, however, be extremely rash to attribute to convergence close similarity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in many points of structure amongst the modified descendants of widely distinct beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the existing races of man differ in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, yet if their whole structure be taken into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> they are found to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same remark holds good with equal or greater force with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans are as different from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the "Beagle," with the many little traits of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>; and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to various simple beliefs and customs, such as the burying of the dead under megalithic structures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now when naturalists observe a close agreement in numerous small details of habits, tastes, and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s between two or more domestic races, or between nearly-allied natural forms, they use this fact as an argument that they are descended from a common progenitor who was thus endowed; and consequently that all should be classed under the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As it is improbable that the numerous and unimportant points of resemblance between the several races of man in bodily structure and mental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all have been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from progenitors who had these same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The spreading of man to regions widely separated by the sea, no doubt, preceded any great amount of divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the several races; for otherwise we should sometimes meet with the same race in distinct continents; and this is never the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One other <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> ought not to be passed over without notice, namely, whether, as is sometimes assumed, each sub-species or race of man has sprung from a single pair of progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With our domestic animals a new race can readily be formed by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully matching the varying offspring from a single pair, or even from a single individual possessing some new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; but most of our races have been formed, not intentionally from a selected pair, but unconsciously by the preservation of many individuals which have varied, however slightly, in some useful or desired manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The remains described by Professor Broca from Les Eyzies, though they unfortunately appear to have belonged to a single family, indicate a race with a most singular combination of low or simious, and of high <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although it has hitherto been found impossible to take an actual census of the natives, their numbers were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully estimated by residents in many districts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of the tribes, thus <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined, lived above a hundred miles apart, some on the coast, some inland; and their means of subsistence and habits differed to a certain extent (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although these changes appear inconsiderable, I can well believe, from what is known with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to animals, that they might suffice to lessen the fertility of the natives.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man in his wild condition seems to be in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> almost as susceptible as his nearest allies, the anthropoid apes, which have never yet survived long, when removed from their native country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Civilised races can certainly resist changes of all kinds far better than savages; and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they resemble domesticated animals, for though the latter sometimes suffer in health (for instance European dogs in India), yet they are rarely rendered sterile, though a few such instances have been recorded.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though the difficulty is great to our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, and really great, if we wish to ascertain the precise causes and their manner of action, it ought not to be so to our reason, as long as we keep steadily in mind that the increase of each species and each race is constantly checked in various ways; so that if any new check, even a slight one, be superadded, the race will surely decrease in number; and decreasing numbers will sooner or later lead to extinction; the end, in most cases, being promptly determined by the inroads of conquering tribes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as with our domesticated animals, a cross-breed can certainly be fixed and made uniform by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection (51.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) in the course of a few generations, we may infer that the free intercrossing of a heterogeneous mixture during a long descent would supply the place of selection, and overcome any tendency to reversion; so that the crossed race would ultimately become homogeneous, though it might not partake in an equal degree of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the two parent-races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) A very damp or a very dry atmosphere has been supposed to be more influential in modifying the colour of the skin than mere heat; but as D'Orbigny in South America, and Livingstone in Africa, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to dampness and dryness, any conclusion on this head must be considered as very doubtful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the spring of 1862 I obtained permission from the Director-General of the Medical department of the Army, to transmit to the surgeons of the various regiments on foreign <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> a blank table, with the following appended remarks, but I have received no returns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"As several well-marked cases have been recorded with our domestic animals of a relation between the colour of the dermal appendages and the constitution; and it being notorious that there is some limited degree of relation between the colour of the races of man and the climate inhabited by them; the following investigation seems worth <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) If, however, we look to the races of man as distributed over the world, we must infer that their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences cannot be accounted for by the direct action of different conditions of life, even after exposure to them for an enormous period of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have now seen that the external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences between the races of man cannot be accounted for in a satisfactory manner by the direct action of the conditions of life, nor by the effects of the continued use of parts, nor through the principle of correlation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But here we are at once met by the objection that beneficial variations alone can be thus preserved; and as far as we are enabled to judge, although always liable to err on this head, none of the differences between the races of man are of any direct or special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> man resembles those forms, called by naturalists protean or polymorphic, which have remained extremely variable, owing, as it seems, to such variations being of an indifferent nature, and to their having thus escaped the action of natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor do I pretend that the effects of sexual selection can be indicated with scientific <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>; but it can be shewn that it would be an inexplicable fact if man had not been modified by this agency, which appears to have acted powerfully on innumerable animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The controversy <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the nature and the extent of the differences in the structure of the brain in man and the apes, which arose some fifteen years ago, has not yet come to an end, though the subject matter of the dispute is, at present, totally different from what it was formerly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that the three structures in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> are as well developed in apes' as in human brains, or even better; and that it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of all the Primates (if we exclude the Lemurs) to have these parts well developed, stands at present on as secure a basis as any proposition in comparative anatomy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) on the cerebral convolutions of man and apes; and as the purpose of my learned colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences between apes and men in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, I am glad to make a citation from him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There remains, then, no dispute as to the resemblance in fundamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, between the ape's brain and man's: nor any as to the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully close similarity between the chimpanzee, orang and man, in even the details of the arrangement of the gyri and sulci of the cerebral hemispheres.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor, turning to the differences between the brains of the highest apes and that of man, is there any serious <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as to the nature and extent of these differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet, in the human brain for instance, Professor Turner remarks: (71.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The obliteration of the external perpendicular fissure of Gratiolet, therefore, is not a constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the human brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, its full development is not a constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the higher ape's brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) "The three specimens of the brain of a chimpanzee, just described, prove, that the generalisation which Gratiolet has attempted to draw of the complete absence of the first connecting convolution and the concealment of the second, as essentially <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic features in the brain of this animal, is by no means universally applicable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the presence of the superior bridging convolution, I am inclined to think that it has existed in one hemisphere, at least, in a majority of the brains of this animal which have, up to this time, been figured or described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even were the presence of the temporo-occipital, or external perpendicular, sulcus, a mark of distinction between the higher apes and man, the value of such a distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would be rendered very doubtful by the structure of the brain in the Platyrrhine apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is thus variable within the limits of a single group can have no great taxonomic value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Again, as <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of absolute size, it is established that the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy human brain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy human brain and the largest chimpanzee's or orang's brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In the paper to which I have referred, Professor Bischoff does not deny the second part of this statement, but he first makes the irrelevant remark that it is not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful if the brains of an orang and a Lemur are very different; and secondly, goes on to assert that, "If we successively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang; the brain of this with that of a chimpanzee; of this with that of a gorilla, and so on of a Hylobates, Semnopithecus, Cynocephalus, Cercopithecus, Macacus, Cebus, Callithrix, Lemur, Stenops, Hapale, we shall not meet with a greater, or even as great a, break in the degree of development of the convolutions, as we find between the brain of a man and that of an orang or chimpanzee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Professor Bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrote, Gratiolet had suggested the separation of the Lemurs from the other Primates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and that Professor Flower had made the following observations in the course of his description of the brain of the Javan Loris: (75.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) "And it is especially remarkable that, in the development of the posterior lobes, there is no approximation to the Lemurine, short hemisphered brain, in those monkeys which are commonly supposed to approach this family in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, viz.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Taking the facts as they now stand, it appears to me that the order of the appearance of the sulci and gyri in the foetal human brain is in perfect harmony with the general doctrine of evolution, and with the view that man has been evolved from some ape-like form; though there can be no doubt that form was, in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, different from any member of the Primates now living.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Von Baer taught us, half a century ago, that, in the course of their development, allied animals put on at first, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the greater groups to which they belong, and, by degrees, assume those which restrict them within the limits of their family, genus, and species; and he proved, at the same time, that no developmental stage of a higher animal is precisely similar to the adult condition of any lower animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is quite correct to say that a frog passes through the condition of a fish, inasmuch as at one period of its life the tadpole has all the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of a fish, and if it went no further, would have to be grouped among fishes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In like manner, the brain of a human foetus, at the fifth month, may correctly be said to be, not only the brain of an ape, but that of an Arctopithecine or marmoset-like ape; for its hemispheres, with their great posterior lobster, and with no sulci but the sylvian and the calcarine, present the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics found only in the group of the Arctopithecine Primates.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt it would be much more similar to the brain of an <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d foetus of a marmoset.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have no information whatever <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the development of the brain in the Cynomorpha; and, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the Anthropomorpha, nothing but the account of the brain of the Gibbon, near birth, already referred to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt, the excellent author of one of the most remarkable contributions to the just <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the mammalian brain which has ever been made, would have been the first to admit the insufficiency of his data had he lived to profit by the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) But it is important to remark that, whether Gratiolet was right or wrong in his hypothesis <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the relative order of appearance of the temporal and frontal sulci, the fact remains; that before either temporal or frontal sulci, appear, the foetal brain of man presents <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are found only in the lowest group of the Primates (leaving out the Lemurs); and that this is exactly what we should expect to be the case, if man has resulted from the gradual modification of the same form as that from which the other Primates have sprung.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals which have their sexes separated, the males necessarily differ from the females in their organs of reproduction; and these are the primary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the sexes often differ in what Hunter has called secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, which are not directly connected with the act of reproduction; for instance, the male possesses certain organs of sense or locomotion, of which the female is quite destitute, or has them more highly-developed, in order that he may readily find or reach her; or again the male has special organs of prehension for holding her securely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are, however, other sexual differences quite unconnected with the primary reproductive organs, and it is with these that we are more especially concerned--such as the greater size, strength, and pugnacity of the male, his weapons of offence or means of defence against rivals, his gaudy colouring and various ornaments, his power of song, and other such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Huia of New Zealand the difference is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully great, and we hear from Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species solely in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perrier <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s this case ('Revue Scientifique,' Feb.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This distinguished naturalist, therefore, like so many other Frenchmen, has not taken the trouble to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> even the first principles of sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) When the two sexes follow exactly the same habits of life, and the male has the sensory or locomotive organs more highly developed than those of the female, it may be that the perfection of these is indispensable to the male for finding the female; but in the vast majority of cases, they serve only to give one male an advantage over another, for with sufficient time, the less well-endowed males would succeed in pairing with the females; and judging from the structure of the female, they would be in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s equally well adapted for their ordinary habits of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again, if the chief <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> rendered to the male by his prehensile organs is to prevent the escape of the female before the arrival of other males, or when assaulted by them, these organs will have been perfected through sexual selection, that is by the advantage acquired by certain individuals over their rivals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is clear that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are the result of sexual and not of ordinary selection, since unarmed, unornamented, or unattractive males would succeed equally well in the battle for life and in leaving a numerous progeny, but for the presence of better endowed males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the kind just referred to, will be fully discussed in the following chapters, as being in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s interesting, but especially as depending on the will, choice, and rivalry of the individuals of either sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Just as man can <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breeds of his game-cocks by the selection of those birds which are victorious in the cockpit, so it appears that the strongest and most vigorous males, or those provided with the best weapons, have prevailed under nature, and have led to the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of the natural breed or species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A slight degree of variability leading to some advantage, however slight, in reiterated deadly contests would suffice for the work of sexual selection; and it is certain that secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are eminently variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jenner Weir, that the bird-catchers assert that this is invariably the case with the nightingale and blackcap, and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the latter he can himself confirm the statement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to sexual selection lies in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how it is that the males which conquer other males, or those which prove the most attractive to the females, leave a greater number of offspring to inherit their superiority than their beaten and less attractive rivals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Unless this result does follow, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which give to certain males an advantage over others, could not be perfected and augmented through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From various facts and <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, I formerly inferred that with most animals, in which secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are well developed, the males considerably exceeded the females in number; but this is not by any means always true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jenner Weir, who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to the habits of birds during many years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here is excellent evidence on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the offspring from an experienced ornithologist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In cases where several broods are reared each year, as a general rule the birds of the earlier broods seem in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the most perfect and vigorous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hermann Müller has come to this same conclusion with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to those female bees which are the first to emerge from the pupa each year.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Such vigorous pairs would surely rear a larger number of offspring than the retarded females, which would be compelled to unite with the conquered and less powerful males, supposing the sexes to be numerically equal; and this is all that is wanted to add, in the course of successive generations, to the size, strength and courage of the males, or to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> their weapons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to poultry, I have received information, hereafter to be given, to this effect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Thus the more vigorous females, which are the first to breed, will have the choice of many males; and though they may not always select the strongest or best armed, they will select those which are vigorous and well armed, and in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the most attractive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That some relation exists between polygamy and the development of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, appears nearly certain; and this supports the view that a numerical preponderance of males would be eminently favourable to the action of sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless many animals, which are strictly monogamous, especially birds, display strongly-marked secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; whilst some few animals, which are polygamous, do not have such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Little is known on this head with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to most other monkeys, but some species are strictly monogamous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ruminants are eminently polygamous, and they present sexual differences more frequently than almost any other group of mammals; this holds good, especially in their weapons, but also in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The wild boar presents well-marked sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, in his great tusks and some other points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The male differs from the female in his immense tusks, greater size, strength, and endurance; so great is the difference in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s that the males when caught are valued at one-fifth more than the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless the two sexes of some sloths (Edentata) differ in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and colour of certain patches of hair on their shoulders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As far as I can discover, he is the only polygamist amongst all the terrestrial Carnivora, and he alone presents well-marked sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To sum up on the means through which, as far as we can judge, sexual selection has led to the development of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why both sexes do not thus acquire the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of their fathers, will be considered hereafter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that many of the lower animals are, in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, analogous with plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the males of species, of which the progenitors were primordially free, should invariably have acquired the habit of approaching the females, instead of being approached by them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The great eagerness of the males has thus indirectly led to their much more frequently developing secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s than the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the development of such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would be much aided, if the males were more liable to vary than the females--as I concluded they were--after a long study of domesticated animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to the variation of the muscles in man, puts in italics the conclusion that "the greatest number of abnormalities in each subject is found in the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The cause of the greater general variability in the male sex, than in the female is unknown, except in so far as secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are extraordinarily variable, and are usually confined to the males; and, as we shall presently see, this fact is, to a certain extent, intelligible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If such variations are of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to either sex, they will not be accumulated and increased by sexual or natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this case the two sexes will come to present permanent, yet unimportant, differences of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) A few exceptional cases occur in various classes of animals, in which the females instead of the males have acquired well pronounced secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, such as brighter colours, greater size, strength, or pugnacity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With birds there has sometimes been a complete transposition of the ordinary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to each sex; the females having become the more eager in courtship, the males remaining comparatively passive, but apparently selecting the more attractive females, as we may infer from the results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certain hen birds have thus been rendered more highly coloured or otherwise ornamented, as well as more powerful and pugnacious than the cocks; these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being transmitted to the female offspring alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to structures acquired through ordinary or natural selection, there is in most cases, as long as the conditions of life remain the same, a limit to the amount of advantageous modification in relation to certain special purposes; but in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to structures adapted to make one male victorious over another, either in fighting or in charming the female, there is no definite limit to the amount of advantageous modification; so that as long as the proper variations arise the work of sexual selection will go on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This circumstance may partly account for the frequent and extraordinary amount of variability presented by secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, natural selection will determine that such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s shall not be acquired by the victorious males, if they would be highly injurious, either by expending too much of their vital powers, or by exposing them to any great danger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The development, however, of certain structures--of the horns, for instance, in certain stags--has been carried to a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful extreme; and in some cases to an extreme which, as far as the general conditions of life are concerned, must be slightly injurious to the male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how sexual selection has acted on many animals of many classes, and in the course of ages has produced a conspicuous result, it is necessary to bear in mind the laws of inheritance, as far as they are known.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two distinct elements are included under the term "inheritance"-- the transmission, and the development of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; but as these generally go together, the distinction is often overlooked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see this distinction in those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are transmitted through the early years of life, but are developed only at maturity or during old age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the same distinction more clearly with secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, for these are transmitted through both sexes, though developed in one alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That they are present in both sexes, is manifest when two species, having strongly- marked sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, are crossed, for each transmits the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to its own male and female sex to the hybrid offspring of either sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same fact is likewise manifest, when <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the male are occasionally developed in the female when she grows old or becomes diseased, as, for instance, when the common hen assumes the flowing tail- feathers, hackles, comb, spurs, voice, and even pugnacity of the cock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, independently of old age or disease, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are occasionally transferred from the male to the female, as when, in certain breeds of the fowl, spurs regularly appear in the young and healthy females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> they are simply developed in the female; for in every breed each detail in the structure of the spur is transmitted through the female to her male offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many cases will hereafter be given, where the female exhibits, more or less perfectly, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the male, in whom they must have been first developed, and then transferred to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The converse case of the first development of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in the female and of transference to the male, is less frequent; it will therefore be well to give one striking instance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With bees the pollen- collecting apparatus is used by the female alone for gathering pollen for the larvae, yet in most of the species it is partially developed in the males to whom it is quite useless, and it is perfectly developed in the males of Bombus or the <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, in all cases of reversion, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are transmitted through two, three, or many more generations, and are then developed under certain unknown favourable conditions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, appearing in a young animal, whether it lasts throughout life or is only transient, will, in general, reappear in the offspring at the same age and last for the same time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, on the other hand, a new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> appears at maturity, or even during old age, it tends to reappear in the offspring at the same <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When deviations from this rule occur, the transmitted <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s much oftener appear before, than after the corresponding age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In several breeds of the Fowl, the down-covered chickens, the young birds in their first true plumage, and the adults differ greatly from one another, as well as from their common parent-form, the Gallus bankiva; and these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are faithfully transmitted by each breed to their offspring at the corresponding periods of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of chickens of different breeds, and on the breeds of the pigeon, alluded to in the following paragraph, see 'Variation of Animals,' etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Pigeon offers a more remarkable case, because the aboriginal parent species does not undergo any change of plumage with advancing age, excepting that at maturity the breast becomes more iridescent; yet there are breeds which do not acquire their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic colours until they have moulted two, three, or four times; and these modifications of plumage are regularly transmitted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals in a state of nature, innumerable instances occur of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s appearing periodically at different seasons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes is the commonest form of inheritance, at least with those animals which do not present strongly- marked sexual differences, and indeed with many of these.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are somewhat commonly transferred exclusively to that sex, in which they first appear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ample evidence on this head has been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in my work on 'Variation under Domestication,' but a few instances may here be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With most breeds of the fowl, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to each sex are transmitted to the same sex alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sexes of the pigeon in the parent-species do not differ in any external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; nevertheless, in certain domesticated breeds the male is coloured differently from the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The wattle in the English Carrier pigeon, and the crop in the Pouter, are more highly developed in the male than in the female; and although these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been gained through long-continued selection by man, the slight differences between the sexes are wholly due to the form of inheritance which has prevailed; for they have arisen, not from, but rather in opposition to, the wish of the breeder.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals under domestication, but whether in nature I will not venture to say, one sex may lose <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to it, and may thus come somewhat to resemble the opposite sex; for instance, the males of some breeds of the fowl have lost their masculine tail-plumes and hackles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to one sex may suddenly appear in the other sex; as in those sub-breeds of the fowl in which the hens acquire spurs whilst young; or, as in certain Polish sub-breeds, in which the females, as there is reason to believe, originally acquired a crest, and subsequently transferred it to the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is one difficult <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which it will be convenient to defer to a future chapter; namely, whether a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> at first developed in both sexes, could through selection be limited in its development to one sex alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, for instance, a breeder observed that some of his pigeons (of which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are usually transferred in an equal degree to both sexes) varied into pale blue, could he by long-continued selection make a breed, in which the males alone should be of this tint, whilst the females remained unchanged? I will here only say, that this, though perhaps not impossible, would be extremely difficult; for the natural result of breeding from the pale-blue males would be to change the whole stock of both sexes to this tint.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a similar manner, if any variation appeared in a female pigeon, which was from the first sexually limited in its development to the females, it would be easy to make a breed with the females alone thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised; but if the variation was not thus originally limited, the process would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After describing some curious cases in pigeons, of the transmission of colour by one sex alone, and the formation of a sub- breed with this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, he says: "It is a singular circumstance that Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>") ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT OF A CHARACTER AND ITS TRANSMISSION TO ONE SEX OR TO BOTH SEXES.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s should be inherited by both sexes, and other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by one sex alone, namely by that sex in which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> first appeared, is in most cases quite unknown.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We cannot even conjecture why with certain sub-breeds of the pigeon, black striae, though transmitted through the female, should be developed in the male alone, whilst every other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is equally transferred to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The very same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, such as deficient or supernumerary digits, colour-blindness, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is in itself probable that any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> appearing at an early age would tend to be inherited equally by both sexes, for the sexes do not differ much in constitution before the power of reproduction is gained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all these cases the variations, through the accumulation of which the male acquired his proper masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, must have occurred at a somewhat late period of life; otherwise the young males would have been similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised; and conformably with our rule, the variations are transmitted to and developed in the adult males alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, on the other hand, the adult male closely resembles the young of both sexes (these, with rare exceptions, being alike), he generally resembles the adult female; and in most of these cases the variations through which the young and old acquired their present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, probably occurred, according to our rule, during youth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is here room for doubt, for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are sometimes transferred to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared in the parents, so that the parents may have varied when adult, and have transferred their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their offspring whilst young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are, moreover, many animals, in which the two sexes closely resemble each other, and yet both differ from their young: and here the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the adults must have been acquired late in life; nevertheless, these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, in apparent contradiction to our rule, are transferred to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cupples for having made enquiries for me in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Roebuck and Red Deer of Scotland from Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Fallow-deer, I have to thank Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the period of development, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Canfield for information with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the horns of the female: see also his paper in 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1866, p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore in comparison with what little we know of the development of the horns in other antelopes, and from what we do know with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the horns of deer, cattle, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Victor Carus for having made enquiries for me, from the highest authorities, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the merino sheep of Saxony.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But with domesticated sheep the presence or absence of horns is not a firmly fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; for a certain proportion of the merino ewes bear small horns, and some of the rams are hornless; and in most breeds hornless ewes are occasionally produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The eared pheasant (Crossoptilon auritum), however, offers a remarkable exception, for both sexes possess the fine caudal plumes, the large ear-tufts and the crimson velvet about the head; I find that all these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s appear very early in life in accordance with rule.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Between such extreme cases of close sexual resemblance and wide dissimilarity, as those of the Crossoptilon and peacock, many intermediate ones could be given, in which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s follow our two rules in their order of development.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As most insects emerge from the pupal state in a mature condition, it is doubtful whether the period of development can determine the transference of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to one or to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A difference of this kind in the period of development is not so improbable as it may at first appear; for with the Orthoptera, which assume their adult state, not by a single metamorphosis, but by a succession of moults, the young males of some species at first resemble the females, and acquire their distinctive masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s only at a later moult.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have as yet considered the transference of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, relatively to their period of development, only in species in a natural state; we will now turn to domesticated animals, and first touch on monstrosities and diseases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The presence of supernumerary digits, and the absence of certain phalanges, must be determined at an early embryonic period--the tendency to profuse bleeding is at least congenital, as is probably colour-blindness-- yet these peculiarities, and other similar ones, are often limited in their transmission to one sex; so that the rule that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, developed at an early period, tend to be transmitted to both sexes, here wholly fails.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this rule, as before remarked, does not appear to be nearly so general as the converse one, namely, that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which appear late in life in one sex are transmitted exclusively to the same sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to sexually-limited diseases, we know too little of the period at which they originate, to draw any safe conclusion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the various domestic breeds of sheep, goats, and cattle, the males differ from their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive females in the shape or development of their horns, forehead, mane, dewlap, tail, and hump on the shoulders; and these peculiarities, in accordance with our rule, are not fully developed until a rather late period of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the English Carrier and Pouter pigeons, the full development of the wattle and the crop occurs rather late in life, and conformably with the rule, these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are transmitted in full perfection to the males alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The following cases perhaps come within the class previously alluded to, in which both sexes have varied in the same manner at a rather late period of life, and have consequently transferred their new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes at a corresponding late period; and if so, these cases are not opposed to our rule:--there exist sub-breeds of the pigeon, described by Neumeister (46.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the breeds of the Fowl the inheritance of various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by one or both sexes, seems generally determined by the period at which such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus in all the many breeds in which the adult male differs greatly in colour from the female, as well as from the wild parent-species, he differs also from the young male, so that the newly- acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s must have appeared at a rather late period of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Spangled Hamburgs, however, offer a partial exception; for the two sexes, though not quite alike, resemble each other more closely than do the sexes of the aboriginal parent-species; yet they acquire their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic plumage late in life, for the chickens are distinctly pencilled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s besides colour, in the wild-parent species and in most of the domestic breeds, the males alone possess a well-developed comb; but in the young of the Spanish fowl it is largely developed at a very early age, and, in accordance with this early development in the male, it is of unusual size in the adult female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Game breeds pugnacity is developed at a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully early age, of which curious proofs could be given; and this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is transmitted to both sexes, so that the hens, from their extreme pugnacity, are now generally exhibited in separate pens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For full particulars and references on all these points <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the several breeds of the Fowl, see 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,' vol.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the higher animals, the sexual differences which have arisen under domestication are described in the same work under the head of each species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>); and in this breed the adults of both sexes are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by a great bony protuberance and an immense crest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, from what we have now seen of the relation which exists in many natural species and domesticated races, between the period of the development of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and the manner of their transmission--for example, the striking fact of the early growth of the horns in the reindeer, in which both sexes bear horns, in comparison with their much later growth in the other species in which the male alone bears horns--we may conclude that one, though not the sole cause of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being exclusively inherited by one sex, is their development at a late age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And secondly, that one, though apparently a less efficient cause of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being inherited by both sexes, is their development at an early age, whilst the sexes differ but little in constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears, however, that some difference must exist between the sexes even during a very early embryonic period, for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s developed at this age not rarely become attached to one sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the foregoing discussion on the various laws of inheritance, we learn that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the parents often, or even generally, tend to become developed in the offspring of the same sex, at the same age, and periodically at the same season of the year, in which they first appeared in the parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the sexes differ in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, it is also, as we have seen, an extremely general law that the adult male differs more or less from the young male; and we may conclude from this fact that the successive variations, by which the adult male became modified, did not generally occur much before the age for reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whenever some or many of the variations occurred early in life, the young males would partake more or less of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the adult males; and differences of this kind between the old and young males may be observed in many species of animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the adult and experienced males, on the other hand, the advantages derived from the acquisition of such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, would more than counterbalance some exposure to danger, and some loss of vital force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As variations which give to the male a better chance of conquering other males, or of finding, securing, or charming the opposite sex, would, if they happened to arise in the female, be of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to her, they would not be preserved in her through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have also good evidence with domesticated animals, that variations of all kinds are, if not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully selected, soon lost through intercrossing and accidental deaths.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, however, the females varied and transmitted their newly acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their offspring of both sexes, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which were advantageous to the males would be preserved by them through sexual selection, and the two sexes would in consequence be modified in the same manner, although such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were of no use to the females: but I shall hereafter have to recur to these more intricate contingencies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, the females may acquire, and apparently have often acquired by transference, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the male sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case, however, is widely different with the reproductive functions, in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> the sexes necessarily differ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For variations in structure which are related to these functions, have often proved of value to one sex, and from having arisen at a late period of life, have been transmitted to one sex alone; and such variations, thus preserved and transmitted, have given rise to secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the following chapters, I shall treat of the secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in animals of all classes, and shall endeavour in each case to apply the principles explained in the present chapter.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals belonging to the lower classes, the two sexes are not rarely united in the same individual, and therefore secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s cannot be developed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would not, for instance, at first occur to any one that the transparency of the Medusae, or jelly-fish, is of the highest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them as a protection; but when we are reminded by Haeckel that not only the Medusae, but many floating Mollusca, crustaceans, and even small oceanic fishes partake of this same glass-like appearance, often accompanied by prismatic colours, we can hardly doubt that they thus escape the notice of pelagic birds and other enemies.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Gasteropoda, though capable of locomotion and furnished with imperfect eyes, do not appear to be endowed with sufficient mental powers for the members of the same sex to struggle together in rivalry, and thus to acquire secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even in the highest class of the Mollusca, the Cephalopoda or cuttle- fishes, in which the sexes are separate, secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the present kind do not, as far as I can discover, occur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Certain Cephalopoda, however, are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by one extraordinary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, namely that the male element collects within one of the arms or tentacles, which is then cast off, and clinging by its sucking-discs to the female, lives for a time an independent life.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fritz Müller suggests that these differences between the two male forms of the same species may have originated in certain individuals having varied in the number of the smelling-threads, whilst other individuals varied in the shape and size of their chelae; so that of the former, those which were best able to find the female, and of the latter, those which were best able to hold her, have left the greatest number of progeny to inherit their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive advantages.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these various <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s it seems probable that the male in this species has become gaily ornamented in order to attract or excite the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This seems a general rule in the whole class in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the many remarkable structural differences between the sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall hereafter find the same law prevailing throughout the great sub-kingdom of the Vertebrata; and in all cases it is eminently distinctive of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have been acquired through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, we may admit with some confidence that the well-marked differences in colour between the sexes of certain species are the results of sexual selection; though we have not here the best kind of evidence,-- the display by the male of his ornaments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the extreme variability of colour in the male of some species, for instance of Theridion lineatum, it would appear that these sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the males have not as yet become well fixed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These organs in the male often differ in closely-allied species, and afford excellent specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Lastly, in the males of many insects, the legs are furnished with peculiar spines, knobs or spurs; or the whole leg is bowed or thickened, but this is by no means invariably a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; or one pair, or all three pairs are elongated, sometimes to an extravagant length.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not known why the wings of the female glow-worm have not been developed; but in her present state she closely resembles a larva, and as larvae are so largely preyed on by many animals, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why she has been rendered so much more luminous and conspicuous than the male; and why the larvae themselves are likewise luminous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He finds, after <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attending to the development of the caterpillars of Bombyx cynthia and yamamai, and especially to that of some dwarfed caterpillars reared from a second brood on unnatural food, "that in proportion as the individual moth is finer, so is the time required for its metamorphosis longer; and for this reason the female, which is the larger and heavier insect, from having to carry her numerous eggs, will be preceded by the male, which is smaller and has less to mature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the most curious case, shewing on what complex and easily-overlooked relations, so trifling a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as difference in size between the sexes may depend, is that of the aculeate Hymenoptera; for Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I have no reason to suppose that this is a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, excepting that with non-social insects there seems to be no use for sound-producing organs, unless it be as a sexual call.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trimen informs me that at the Cape of Good Hope these insects make a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful noise during the night.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we cannot suppose that they have been transferred from the male to the female, as appears to have been the case with the secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of many other animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We need feel no surprise at the amount of modification which the Orthoptera have undergone in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, as we now know, from Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The insect, though in most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s related to the Neuroptera, appears, as is so often the case with very ancient forms, to connect the two related Orders of the Neuroptera and Orthoptera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to colour, some exotic locusts are beautifully ornamented; the posterior wings being marked with red, blue, and black; but as throughout the Order the sexes rarely differ much in colour, it is not probable that they owe their bright tints to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Brauer "explains the phenomenon on Darwinian principles by the supposition that the close netting of the veins is a secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the males, which has been abruptly transferred to some of the females, instead of, as generally occurs, to all of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is probably a case of reversion; for in the true Libellulae, when the sexes differ in colour, the females are orange or yellow; so that supposing Agrion to be descended from some primordial form which resembled the typical Libellulae in its sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, it would not be surprising that a tendency to vary in this manner should occur in the females alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, Pierre Huber, whose accuracy no one doubts, separated some ants, and when, after an interval of four months, they met others which had formerly belonged to the same community, they recognised and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed one another with their antennae.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>868), without apparently having reflected much on the subject, objects that as the males of social bees are known to be produced from unfertilised ova, they could not transmit new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their male offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A female bee fertilised by a male, which presented some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> facilitating the union of the sexes, or rendering him more attractive to the female, would lay eggs which would produce only females; but these young females would next year produce males; and will it be pretended that such males would not inherit the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of their male grandfathers? To take a case with ordinary animals as nearly parallel as possible: if a female of any white quadruped or bird were crossed by a male of a black breed, and the male and female offspring were paired together, will it be pretended that the grandchildren would not inherit a tendency to blackness from their male grandfather? The acquirement of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by the sterile worker-bees is a much more difficult case, but I have endeavoured to shew in my 'Origin of Species,' how these sterile beings are subjected to the power of natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such colours can hardly serve directly as a protection, except in the case of certain flower-feeding species; but they may serve as a warning or means of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>, on the same principle as the phosphorescence of the glow-worm.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As with beetles the colours of the two sexes are generally alike, we have no evidence that they have been gained through sexual selection; but this is at least possible, for they have been developed in one sex and then transferred to the other; and this view is even in some degree probable in those groups which possess other well- marked secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole, as far as I could judge, the females of those Prionidae, in which the sexes differ, are coloured more richly than the males, and this does not accord with the common rule in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to colour, when acquired through sexual selection.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bates, after a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful examination of numerous species, find any sufficient evidence, in their mutilated or broken condition, of their having been thus used.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bates, after comparing the two sexes in above a hundred species of the Copridae, did not find any marked difference in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> amongst well-developed individuals.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We thus see that in the different coleopterous families the stridulating organs are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully diversified in position, but not much in structure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace informs me that the Euchirus longimanus (a Lamellicorn, with the anterior legs <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully elongated in the male) "makes, whilst moving, a low hissing sound by the protrusion and contraction of the abdomen; and when seized it produces a grating sound by rubbing its hind-legs against the edges of the elytra.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the analogy of the Orthoptera and Homoptera, I expected to find the stridulating organs in the Coleoptera differing according to sex; but Landois, who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined several species, observed no such difference; nor did Westring; nor did Mr.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every one must have admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies and of some moths; and it may be asked, are their colours and diversified patterns the result of the direct action of the physical conditions to which these insects have been exposed, without any benefit being thus derived? Or have successive variations been accumulated and determined as a protection, or for some unknown purpose, or that one sex may be attractive to the other? And, again, what is the meaning of the colours being widely different in the males and females of certain species, and alike in the two sexes of other species of the same genus? Before attempting to answer these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s a body of facts must be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace on the same subject, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Diadema, in 'Transactions, Entomological Society of London,' 1869, p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Butler, namely, one of the tropical American Theclae, in which both sexes are nearly alike and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully splendid; in another species the male is coloured in a similarly gorgeous manner, whilst the whole upper surface of the female is of a dull uniform brown.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>sara from California, the orange- tips to the wings have been partially developed in the female; but they are paler than in the male, and slightly different in some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Butler, the under surface of the wings <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lously resembles a pale- coloured leaf; and in our English orange-tip, the under surface resembles the flower-head of the wild parsley, on which the butterfly often rests at night.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The same reason which compels us to believe that the lower surfaces have here been coloured for the sake of protection, leads us to deny that the wings have been tipped with bright orange for the same purpose, especially when this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is confined to the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) There is evidence of another kind in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to display.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence the lower surface generally affords to entomologists the more useful <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> for detecting the affinities of the various species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) observes that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements; "for instance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings as if for display, which is more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of diurnal than of nocturnal Lepidoptera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The females, as several entomologists have remarked to me, lie in an almost torpid state, and appear not to evince the least choice in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to their partners.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Throughout the animal kingdom the males commonly take the more active share in wooing, and their beauty seems to have been increased by the females having accepted the more attractive individuals; but with these butterflies, the females take the more active part in the final marriage ceremony, so that we may suppose that they likewise do so in the wooing; and in this case we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that they have been rendered the more beautiful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to colour there is no difficulty, for any number of highly variable Lepidoptera could be named.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When both sexes are brilliantly coloured and resemble each other, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by the males appear to have been transmitted to both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that the females of allied species generally resemble one another so much more closely than do the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we treat of Birds, I shall have to discuss the whole <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, as to how far the differences in colour between the sexes are due to the males having been modified through sexual selection for ornamental purposes, or to the females having been modified through natural selection for the sake of protection, so that I will here say but little on the subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to account for the frequent transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to one sex alone, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We know from what occurs under domestication that new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s often appear, which from the first are transmitted to one sex alone; and by the selection of such variations there would not be the slightest difficulty in giving bright colours to the males alone, and at the same time or subsequently, dull colours to the females alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am, however, unwilling without distinct evidence to admit that two complex processes of selection, each requiring the transference of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to one sex alone, have been carried on with a multitude of species,--that the males have been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals, and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, as we have seen, various <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s lead to the conclusion that with the greater number of brilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera it is the male which has been chiefly modified through sexual selection; the amount of difference between the sexes mostly depending on the form of inheritance which has prevailed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>); and we can thus, to a certain extent, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that with closely allied species the sexes either differ to an astonishing degree, or are identical in colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all the successive steps in the process of variation are necessarily transmitted through the female, a greater or less number of such steps might readily become developed in her; and thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the frequent gradations from an extreme difference to none at all between the sexes of allied species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bates inferred that the butterflies which imitate the protected species have acquired their present <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lously deceptive appearance through variation and natural selection, in order to be mistaken for the protected kinds, and thus to escape being devoured.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) As some writers have felt much difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how the first steps in the process of mimicry could have been effected through natural selection, it may be well to remark that the process probably commenced long ago between forms not widely dissimilar in colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>); that the males of some of the Leptalides, which imitate protected species, still retain in a concealed manner some of their original <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After some <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> he replied: "Most caterpillars require protection, as may be inferred from some kinds being furnished with spines or irritating hairs, and from many being coloured green like the leaves on which they feed, or being curiously like the twigs of the trees on which they live.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From such <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the most gaudy colours would be <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, and might have been gained by variation and the survival of the most easily- recognised individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Looking back to the several Orders, we see that the sexes often differ in various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, the meaning of which is not in the least understood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is instructive to reflect on the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful diversity of the means for producing sound, possessed by the males alone, or by both sexes, in no less than six Orders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we admit that the females of the Homoptera and Orthoptera appreciate the musical tones of their male partners, and that the various instruments have been perfected through sexual selection, there is little improbability in the females of other insects appreciating beauty in form or colour, and consequently in such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s having been thus gained by the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the Coleoptera, however, as before remarked, it is in the great Lamellicorn group, placed by some authors at the head of the Order, and in which we sometimes see a mutual attachment between the sexes, that we find the males of some species possessing weapons for sexual strife, others furnished with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful horns, many with stridulating organs, and others ornamented with splendid metallic tints.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it seems probable that all these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been gained through the same means, namely sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we treat of Birds, we shall see that they present in their secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s the closest analogy with insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall see that female birds, like female insects, often possess more or less plain traces or rudiments of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which properly belong to the males and are of use only to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The analogy, indeed, in all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s between birds and insects is curiously close.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As so frequently occurs with secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, both sexes of some species of rays (for instance R.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] In the very distinct family of the Cyprinodontidae--inhabitants of the fresh waters of foreign lands--the sexes sometimes differ much in various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this and the following species I am indebted to Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the courtship of fishes, other cases have been observed since the first edition of this book appeared, besides that already given of the stickleback.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Each male now mounts vigilant guard over his <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive hollow, and vigorously attacks and drives away any other fish of the same sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Towards his companions of the opposite sex his conduct is far different; many of the latter are now distended with spawn, and these he endeavours by all the means in his power to lure singly to his prepared hollow, and there to deposit the myriad ova with which they are laden, which he then protects and guards with the greatest <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Carbonnier, who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed these fishes under confinement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the male soon deposits them in the disc of froth, afterwards guarding them, repairing the froth, and taking <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the young when hatched.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have next to inquire whether this view of the bright colours of certain male fishes having been acquired through sexual selection can, through the law of the equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes, be extended to those groups in which the males and females are brilliant in the same, or nearly the same degree and manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, more probable that these colours have been intensified through artificial selection, as this species has been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully bred in China from a remote period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What, then, are we to conclude in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the many fishes, both sexes of which are splendidly coloured? Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole, the most probable view in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the fishes, of which both sexes are brilliantly coloured, is that their colours were acquired by the males as a sexual ornament, and were transferred equally, or nearly so, to the other sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> now under <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is whether the females alone have been modified for this object.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can see that one sex will not be modified through natural selection for the sake of protection more than the other, supposing both to vary, unless one sex is exposed for a longer period to danger, or has less power of escaping from such danger than the other; and it does not appear that with fishes the sexes differ in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certain fishes, belonging to several families, make nests, and some of them take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of their young when hatched.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>leiurus) performs the duties of a nurse with exemplary <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and vigilance during a long time, and is continually employed in gently leading back the young to the nest, when they stray too far.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the various species of Chromids, as Professor Agassiz likewise informs me, sexual differences in colour may be observed, "whether they lay their eggs in the water among aquatic plants, or deposit them in holes, leaving them to come out without further <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, or build shallow nests in the river mud, over which they sit, as our Pomotis does.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It ought also to be observed that these sitters are among the brightest species in their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive families; for instance, Hygrogonus is bright green, with large black ocelli, encircled with the most brilliant red.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is further manifest, in all the cases in which the males take exclusive charge of the nests and young, that the destruction of the brighter-coloured males would be far more influential on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the race, than the destruction of the brighter-coloured females; for the death of the male during the period of incubation or nursing would entail the death of the young, so that they could not inherit his peculiarities; yet, in many of these very cases the males are more conspicuously coloured than the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), for the female is much more vividly-coloured and spotted than the male, and she alone has a marsupial sack and hatches the eggs; so that the female of Solenostoma differs from all the other Lophobranchii in this latter <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, and from almost all other fishes, in being more brightly-coloured than the male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is improbable that this remarkable double inversion of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the female should be an accidental coincidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole we may conclude, that with most fishes, in which the sexes differ in colour or in other ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, the males originally varied, with their variations transmitted to the same sex, and accumulated through sexual selection by attracting or exciting the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In many cases, however, such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been transferred, either partially or completely, to the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In other cases, again, both sexes have been coloured alike for the sake of protection; but in no instance does it appear that the female alone has had her colours or other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s specially modified for this latter purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to sexual differences of colour, Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) It is surprising that these animals have not acquired more strongly-marked sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; for though cold-blooded their passions are strong.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to colour, be can almost always distinguish the male from the female, by his more strongly- pronounced tints; thus the black zigzag band on the back of the male English viper is more distinctly defined than in the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the rattling of the rattle-snake, we have at last some definite information: for Professor Aughey states (64.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Male with the gular pouch expanded (from Gunther's 'Reptiles of India')'] The sexes often differ greatly in various external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here we see with species belonging to the same group, as in so many previous cases, the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> either confined to the males, or more largely developed in them than in the females, or again equally developed in both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the foregoing statements and quotations, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Cophotis, Sitana and Draco, as well as the following facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Ceratophora and Chamaeleon, are from Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>35), an inhabitant of Madagascar, is produced into two great, solid, bony projections, covered with scales like the rest of the head; and of this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful modification of structure the female exhibits only a rudiment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF BIRDS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are more diversified and conspicuous in birds, though not perhaps entailing more important changes of structure, than in any other class of animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before treating of the sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s with which we are here more particularly concerned, I may just allude to certain differences between the sexes which apparently depend on differences in their habits of life; for such cases, though common in the lower, are rare in the higher classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference in size between the two sexes is carried to an extreme point in several Australian species; thus the male musk-duck (Biziura), and the male Cincloramphus cruralis (allied to our pipits) are by measurement actually twice as large as their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Like most other secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, the spurs are highly variable, both in number and development, in the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In certain plovers, however, the wing-spurs must be considered as a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Lobivanellus, see Jerdon's 'Birds of India,' vol.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Naturalists are much divided with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the object of the singing of birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Few more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observers ever lived than Montagu, and he maintained that the "males of song-birds and of many others do not in general search for the female, but, on the contrary, their business in the spring is to perch on some conspicuous spot, breathing out their full and amorous notes, which, by instinct, the female knows, and repairs to the spot to choose her mate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many instances have already been given of the partial transference of secondary masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to the female, so that it is not at all surprising that the females of some species should possess the power of song.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As shewn in a previous chapter, singing is to a certain extent an art, and is much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by practice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the swan, as given above, Yarrell's 'History of British Birds,' 2nd edition, 1845, vol.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not difficult to imagine the steps by which the notes of a bird, primarily used as a mere call or for some other purpose, might have been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d into a melodious love song.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Both sexes <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> in the erection of the bowers, but the male is the principal workman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The ornaments, as mentioned at the commencement of this chapter, are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully diversified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to colour, hardly anything need here be said, for every one knows how splendid are the tints of many birds, and how harmoniously they are combined.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor need much be said on the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful difference between the sexes of many birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould shewed me, to a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful extreme in some species belonging to nearly every sub-group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such cases are curiously like those which we see in our fancy breeds, reared by man for the sake of ornament; certain individuals originally varied in one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and other individuals of the same species in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and these have been seized on by man and much augmented--as shewn by the tail of the fantail- pigeon, the hood of the jacobin, the beak and wattle of the carrier, and so forth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the birds which annually undergo a double moult, there are, firstly, some kinds, for instance snipes, swallow-plovers (Glareolae), and curlews, in which the two sexes resemble each other, and do not change colour at any season.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the cause or purpose of the differences in colour between the summer and winter plumage, this may in some instances, as with the ptarmigan (79.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also known that confinement, by affecting the reproductive system of male birds, frequently checks the development of their secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, but has no immediate influence on any other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and I am informed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the previous statements on moulting, see, on snipes, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) From the foregoing facts, more especially from neither sex of certain birds changing colour during either annual moult, or changing so slightly that the change can hardly be of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them, and from the females of other species moulting twice yet retaining the same colours throughout the year, we may conclude that the habit of annually moulting twice has not been acquired in order that the male should assume an ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during the breeding-season; but that the double moult, having been originally acquired for some distinct purpose, has subsequently been taken advantage of in certain cases for gaining a nuptial plumage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the foregoing statements in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to partial moults, and on old males retaining their nuptial plumage, see Jerdon, on bustards and plovers, in 'Birds of India,' vol.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similar facts have already been given with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to grouse of various kinds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These birds, when kept in confinement in the Malay Archipelago, are said to take much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in keeping their feathers clean; often spreading them out, examining them, and removing every speck of dirt.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ocelli on the wing-feathers are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful objects; for they are so shaded that, as the Duke of Argyll remarks (90.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may well be asked, could such artistically shaded ornaments have been formed by means of sexual selection? But it will be convenient to defer giving an answer to this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> until we treat in the next chapter of the principle of gradation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The foregoing remarks relate to the secondary wing-feathers, but the primary wing-feathers, which in most gallinaceous birds are uniformly coloured, are in the Argus pheasant equally <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is undoubtedly a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous fact that she should possess this almost human degree of taste.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who thinks that he can safely gauge the discrimination and taste of the lower animals may deny that the female Argus pheasant can appreciate such refined beauty; but he will then be compelled to admit that the extraordinary attitudes assumed by the male during the act of courtship, by which the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful beauty of his plumage is fully displayed, are purposeless; and this is a conclusion which I for one will never admit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although so many pheasants and allied gallinaceous birds <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully display their plumage before the females, it is remarkable, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jenner Weir, also, finds that all male birds with rich or strongly-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised plumage are more quarrelsome than the dull- coloured species belonging to the same groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These cases are in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s more curious than the foregoing, and have been but little noticed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The bullfinch makes his <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s in front of the female, and then puffs out his breast, so that many more of the crimson feathers are seen at once than otherwise would be the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sufficient facts have now been given to shew with what <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> male birds display their various charms, and this they do with the utmost skill.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould has remarked, it probably is that such birds are generally of a shy <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, as if conscious that their beauty was a source of danger, and are much more difficult to discover or approach, than the sombre coloured and comparatively tame females or than the young and as yet unadorned males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may perhaps be objected that the comb and wattles are not ornamental, and cannot be of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the birds in this way; but even to our eyes, the beauty of the glossy black Spanish cock is much enhanced by his white face and crimson comb; and no one who has ever seen the splendid blue wattles of the male Tragopan pheasant distended in courtship can for a moment doubt that beauty is the object gained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Choice exerted by the female--Length of courtship--Unpaired birds--Mental qualities and taste for the beautiful--Preference or antipathy shewn by the female for particular males--Variability of birds--Variations sometimes abrupt--Laws of variation--Formation of ocelli--Gradations of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>-- Case of Peacock, Argus pheasant, and Urosticte.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we may conclude that it is the object of the male to induce the female to pair with him, and for this purpose he tries to excite or charm her in various ways; and this is the opinion of all those who have <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully studied the habits of living birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there remains a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which has an all important bearing on sexual selection, namely, does every male of the same species excite and attract the female equally? Or does she exert a choice, and prefer certain males? This latter <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> can be answered in the affirmative by much direct and indirect evidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the assemblages of the above named grouse, see Brehm, 'Thierleben,' B.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>References in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the assemblages of other birds have already been given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With such birds it might have been thought that the stronger males would simply have driven away the weaker, and then at once have taken possession of as many females as possible; but if it be indispensable for the male to excite or please the female, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the length of the courtship and the congregation of so many individuals of both sexes at the same spot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the latter bird (Phoenicura ruticilla), a writer expresses much surprise how the sitting female could so soon have given effectual notice that she was a widow, for the species was not common in the neighbourhood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to birds living in triplets, I owe to Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before we further discuss the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the females select the more attractive males or accept the first whom they may encounter, it will be advisable briefly to consider the mental powers of birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Buxton gives a curious account of a parrot which took <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of a frost-bitten and crippled bird of a distinct species, cleansed her feathers, and defended her from the attacks of the other parrots which roamed freely about his garden.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a still more curious fact that these birds apparently evince some <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for the pleasures of their fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As male birds display their fine plumage and other ornaments with so much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> before the females, it is obviously probable that these appreciate the beauty of their suitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), attracts the ruff towards any bright object, so that, in the Ionian Islands, "it will dart down to a bright- coloured handkerchief, <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>less of repeated shots.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould say that "these highly decorated halls of assembly must be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instances of bird- architecture yet discovered;" and the taste, as we see, of the several species certainly differs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was evidently a case of love at first sight, for she swam about the new-comer <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssingly, though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse to her overtures of affection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to birds in a state of nature, the first and most obvious supposition which will occur to every one is that the female at the proper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost invariably pursued by many males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" With one of the vultures (Cathartes aura) of the United States, parties of eight, ten, or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, "exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually," and after many <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses, each male leads off his partner on the wing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Audubon likewise <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed the wild flocks of Canada geese (Anser canadensis), and gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had been previously mated "renewed their courtship as early as the month of January, while the others would be contending or coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that they were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to keep in pairs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Many similar statements with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other birds could be cited from this same observer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Turning now to domesticated and confined birds, I will commence by giving what little I have learnt <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the courtship of fowls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It will be admitted by every one that these gentlemen, so well known from their published works, are <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and experienced observers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Under ordinary circumstances the males and females of the fowl seem to come to a mutual <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing by means of certain gestures, described to me by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Old hens, and hens of a pugnacious <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, as the same writer informs me, dislike strange males, and will not yield until well beaten into compliance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) There is reason to believe that pigeons of both sexes prefer pairing with birds of the same breed; and dovecot-pigeons dislike all the highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Boitard and Corbie, whose experience extended over forty-five years, state: "Quand une femelle éprouve de l'antipathie pour un mâle avec lequel on veut l'accoupler, malgré tous les feux de l'amour, malgré l'alpiste et le chenevis dont on la nourrit pour augmenter son ardeur, malgré un emprisonnement de six mois et même d'un an, elle refuse constamment ses <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses; les avances empressées, les agaceries, les tournoiemens, les tendres roucoulemens, rien ne peut lui plaire ni l'émouvoir; gonflée, boudeuse, blottie dans un coin de sa prison, elle n'en sort que pour boire et manger, ou pour repousser avec une espèce de rage des <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses devenues trop pressantes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), are of a profligate <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and prefer almost any stranger to their own mate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Heron states that with peafowl, the first <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s are always made by the female; something of the same kind takes place, according to Audubon, with the older females of the wild turkey.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to peafowl, see Sir R.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>): from some inexplicable cause he shews the most determined aversion to certain hens, which no <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> on the part of the breeder can overcome.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to female birds feeling a preference for particular males, we must bear in mind that we can judge of choice being exerted only by analogy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What then are we to conclude from these facts and <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s? Does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no purpose? Are we not justified in believing that the female exerts a choice, and that she receives the addresses of the male who pleases her most? It is not probable that she consciously deliberates; but she is most excited or attracted by the most beautiful, or melodious, or gallant males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, after hearing how <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully the male Argus pheasant displays his elegant primary wing-feathers, and erects his ocellated plumes in the right position for their full effect; or again, how the male goldfinch alternately displays his gold-bespangled wings, we ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend to each detail of beauty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these various <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s we may conclude that the pairing of birds is not left to chance; but that those males, which are best able by their various charms to please or excite the female, are under ordinary circumstances accepted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this be admitted, there is not much difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how male birds have gradually acquired their ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>VARIABILITY OF BIRDS, AND ESPECIALLY OF THEIR SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>297), there are 425 indubitable species of birds which breed in Europe, besides sixty forms, which are frequently <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cases of the latter kind have recently been observed with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had also fully appreciated the importance of mere individual differences, and this led me to insist so strongly on the importance of that unconscious form of selection by man, which follows from the preservation of the most valued individuals of each breed, without any intention on his part to modify the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould is well known to admit the existence of few varieties, for he <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>s very slight differences as specific; yet he states (36.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The following case is in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s more interesting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of this variety are not quite constant, yet it has been named by several distinguished ornithologists as a distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised (41.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This conspicuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has caused the bird to be ranked by several ornithologists as a distinct species under the name of U.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the slight individual differences which are common, in a greater or less degree, to all the members of the same species, we have every reason to believe that they are by far the most important for the work of selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are eminently liable to vary, both with animals in a state of nature and under domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus acquired are transmitted to one sex or to both sexes, depends, as we shall see in the following chapter, on the form of inheritance which prevails.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not here refer to the many instances where the male displays splendid colours or other ornaments, of which the female partakes to a slight degree; for these are almost certainly due to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s primarily acquired by the male having been more or less transferred to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what are we to conclude with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to certain birds in which, for instance, the eyes differ slightly in colour in the two sexes? (44.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The comb of many gallinaceous birds is highly ornamental, and assumes vivid colours during the act of courtship; but what are we to think of the dull- coloured comb of the condor, which does not appear to us in the least ornamental? The same <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be asked in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to various other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, such as the knob on the base of the beak of the Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides), which is much larger in the male than in the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No certain answer can be given to these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s; but we ought to be cautious in assuming that knobs and various fleshy appendages cannot be attractive to the female, when we remember that with savage races of man various hideous deformities--deep scars on the face with the flesh raised into protuberances, the septum of the nose pierced by sticks or bones, holes in the ears and lips stretched widely open--are all admired as ornamental.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all the breeds the feathers on the neck and loins of the males are elongated, and are called hackles; now when both sexes acquire a top-knot, which is a new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the genus, the feathers on the head of the male become hackle-shaped, evidently on the principle of correlation; whilst those on the head of the female are of the ordinary shape.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although we do not know the steps by which these <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully beautiful and complex ornaments have been developed, the process has probably been a simple one, at least with insects; for, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trimen writes to me, "no <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of mere marking or coloration are so unstable in the Lepidoptera as the ocelli, both in number and size.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trimen; see also his description of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful amount of variation in the coloration and shape of the wings of this butterfly, in his 'Rhopalocera Africae Australis,' p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>GRADATION OF SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may, however, generally gain a clue by comparing all the species of the same group, if it be a large one; for some of them will probably retain, at least partially, traces of their former <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Instead of entering on tedious details <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing various groups, in which striking instances of gradation could be given, it seems the best plan to take one or two strongly marked cases, for instance that of the peacock, in order to see if light can be thrown on the steps by which this bird has become so splendidly decorated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A trifling <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the disc deserves notice; the barbs, for a space along one of the concentric zones are more or less destitute of their barbules, so that a part of the disc is surrounded by an almost transparent zone, which gives it a highly finished aspect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we admit the principle of gradual evolution, there must formerly have existed many species which presented every successive step between the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully elongated tail-coverts of the peacock and the short tail- coverts of all ordinary birds; and again between the magnificent ocelli of the former, and the simpler ocelli or mere coloured spots on other birds; and so with all the other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the peacock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>napoleonis the ocelli are confined to the tail, and the back is of a rich metallic blue; in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s this species approaches the Java peacock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The unusual length of the tail-coverts is another remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in Polyplectron; for in some of the species they are half, and in others two-thirds as long as the true tail-feathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the several species of Polyplectron manifestly make a graduated approach to the peacock in the length of their tail-coverts, in the zoning of the ocelli, and in some other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they differ remarkably from the tail-feathers of Polyplectron, which in most of the species are ornamented with larger ocelli than those on the tail-coverts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence I was led <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to examine the tail-feathers of the several species, in order to discover whether their ocelli shewed any tendency to disappear; and to my great satisfaction, this appeared to be so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>malaccense, the ocelli on the tail-coverts are, as we have seen, confluent; and these feathers are of unusual length, being two-thirds of the length of the tail-feathers, so that in both these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s they approach the tail-coverts of the peacock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Another excellent case for investigation is offered by the ocelli on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant, which are shaded in so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful a manner as to resemble balls lying loose within sockets, and consequently differ from ordinary ocelli.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(see the lettered diagram on the right hand), of dark spots of the usual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The mark (b) corresponds in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> with the basal shaded spot of the simple feather described in the last paragraph (Fig.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every step can be followed in the process of confluence and modification; and the black ring which surrounds the ball of the ocellus is un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ably formed by the union and modification of the three black marks, b, c, d, of the elliptic ornament.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As this stripe is thus abruptly cut off, we can perhaps <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> from what has gone before, how it is that the upper thickened part of the ring is here absent; for, as before stated, this thickened part apparently stands in some relation with a broken prolongation from the next higher spot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the absence of the upper and thickened part of the ring, the uppermost ocellus, though perfect in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, appears as if its top had been obliquely sliced off.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But here comes the curious point; the outer feathers are held almost horizontally, and their ocelli ought likewise to appear as if illuminated from above, and consequently the white marks ought to be placed on the upper sides of the ocelli; and, <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful as is the fact, they are thus placed! Hence the ocelli on the several feathers, though occupying very different positions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the light, all appear as if illuminated from above, just as an artist would have shaded them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And we know what Helmholtz, the highest authority in Europe on the subject, has said about the human eye; that if an optician had sold him an instrument so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessly made, he would have thought himself fully justified in returning it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) We have now seen that a perfect series can be followed, from simple spots to the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful ball-and-socket ornaments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bearing in mind how <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully the male Argus pheasant displays his plumes before the female, as well as the many facts rendering it probable that female birds prefer the more attractive males, no one who admits the agency of sexual selection in any case will deny that a simple dark spot with some fulvous shading might be converted, through the approximation and modification of two adjoining spots, together with some slight increase of colour, into one of the so- called elliptic ornaments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the secondary plumes became lengthened through sexual selection, and as the elliptic ornaments increased in diameter, their colours apparently became less bright; and then the ornamentation of the plumes had to be gained by an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in the pattern and shading; and this process was carried on until the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful ball-and-socket ocelli were finally developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>--and in no other way as it seems to me--the present condition and origin of the ornaments on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the light afforded by the principle of gradation--from what we know of the laws of variation--from the changes which have taken place in many of our domesticated birds--and, lastly, from the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> (as we shall hereafter see more clearly) of the immature plumage of young birds--we can sometimes indicate, with a certain amount of confidence, the probable steps by which the males have acquired their brilliant plumage and various ornaments; yet in many cases we are involved in complete darkness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) I briefly suggested that the long tail of the peacock would be inconvenient and the conspicuous black colour of the male capercailzie dangerous, to the female during the period of incubation: and consequently that the transmission of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the male to the female offspring had been checked through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely, whether the transmission of a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which is at first inherited by both sexes can be subsequently limited in its transmission to one sex alone by means of natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must bear in mind, as shewn in the preliminary chapter on sexual selection, that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are limited in their development to one sex are always latent in the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As with pigeons <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of all kinds are usually transmitted to both sexes equally, the fancier would have to try to convert this latter form of inheritance into sexually-limited transmission.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The extreme importance, or rather necessity in the above case of the desired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, namely, pale-blueness, being present though in a latent state in the female, so that the male offspring should not be deteriorated, will be best appreciated as follows: the male of Soemmerring's pheasant has a tail thirty-seven inches in length, whilst that of the female is only eight inches; the tail of the male common pheasant is about twenty inches, and that of the female twelve inches long.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can hardly be a doubt that this is the cause of the male pouter pigeon having a somewhat larger crop, and of the male carrier pigeon having somewhat larger wattles, than their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive females; for fanciers have not selected one sex more than the other, and have had no wish that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s should be more strongly displayed in the male than in the female, yet this is the case with both breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see this with the fowl; thus the two sexes of the pencilled Hamburghs differ greatly from each other, and from the two sexes of the aboriginal Gallus bankiva; and both are now kept constant to their standard of excellence by continued selection, which would be impossible unless the distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of both were limited in their transmission.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the comb of the female differs in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, the uprightness of the comb in the male must likewise be a sexually- limited <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, otherwise it would prevent the comb of the female from lopping over.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, by means of successive variations, which were from the first sexually limited in their transmission, there would not be the least difficulty in rendering a male bird widely different in colour or in any other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the female; the latter being left unaltered, or slightly altered, or specially modified for the sake of protection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As bright colours are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the males in their rivalry with other males, such colours would be selected whether or not they were transmitted exclusively to the same sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would be tedious to follow out all the other possible results; but I may remind the reader that if sexually-limited variations in brightness occurred in the females, even if they were not in the least injurious to them and consequently were not eliminated, yet they would not be favoured or selected, for the male usually accepts any female, and does not select the more attractive individuals; consequently these variations would be liable to be lost, and would have little influence on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the race; and this will aid in accounting for the females being commonly duller-coloured than the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was further shewn that if a male bird varied by becoming brighter whilst young, such variations would be of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> until the age for reproduction had arrived, and there was competition between rival males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will therefore discuss this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> at some length, even more fully than its intrinsic importance deserves; for various curious collateral points may thus be conveniently considered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) It is a safer conclusion that, as vocal and instrumental organs are of special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> only to the males during their courtship, these organs were developed through sexual selection and their constant use in that sex alone--the successive variations and the effects of use having been from the first more or less limited in transmission to the male offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Naturalists have <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed how the female Menura could manage her tail during incubation; but it is now known (8.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are led to a nearly similar conclusion with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the length of the tail in the various species of pheasants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus in the several species, the tail of the female differs much in length, ir<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively of that of the male; and this can be accounted for, as it seems to me, with much more probability, by the laws of inheritance,--that is by the successive variations having been from the first more or less closely limited in their transmission to the male sex than by the agency of natural selection, resulting from the length of tail being more or less injurious to the females of these several allied species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace's arguments in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the sexual coloration of birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace admits that there are, as might have been expected, some exceptions to his two rules, but it is a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the exceptions are not so numerous as seriously to invalidate them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is in the first place much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in the Duke of Argyll's remark (10.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace admits that with the King-crows (Dicrurus), Orioles, and Pittidae, the females are conspicuously coloured, yet build open nests; but he urges that the birds of the first group are highly pugnacious and could defend themselves; that those of the second group take extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in concealing their open nests, but this does not invariably hold good (12.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to birds which build in holes or construct domed nests, other advantages, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The female Horn-bill (Buceros), for instance, of India and Africa is protected during incubation with extraordinary <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, for she plasters up with her own excrement the orifice of the hole in which she sits on her eggs, leaving only a small orifice through which the male feeds her; she is thus kept a close prisoner during the whole period of incubation (16.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have consulted, on this subject, Macgillivray's 'British Birds,' and though doubts may be entertained in some cases in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the degree of concealment of the nest, and to the degree of conspicuousness of the female, yet the following birds, which all lay their eggs in holes or in domed nests, can hardly be considered, by the above standard, as conspicuous: Passer, 2 species; Sturnus, of which the female is considerably less brilliant than the male; Cinclus; Motallica boarula (?); Erithacus (?); Fruticola, 2 sp.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>musicus) hardly at all from their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive males; yet all build open nests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here, as in most other deserts, various birds, and many other animals, have had their colours adapted in a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful manner to the tints of the surrounding surface.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the above groups in which the females are conspicuously coloured and build concealed nests, it is not necessary to suppose that each separate species had its nidifying instinct specially modified; but only that the early progenitors of each group were gradually led to build domed or concealed nests, and afterwards transmitted this instinct, together with their bright colours, to their modified descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is an interesting fact, as shewing how the same peculiar style of sexual colouring often <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ises allied forms, that in three species of Dacelo the male differs from the female only in the tail being dull-blue banded with black, whilst that of the female is brown with blackish bars; so that here the tail differs in colour in the two sexes in exactly the same manner as the whole upper surface in the two sexes of Carcineutes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view is strengthened by what Malherbe states with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Indopicus carlotta; namely, that the young females, like the young males, have some crimson about their heads, but that this colour disappears in the adult female, whilst it is intensified in the adult male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s render this view extremely doubtful: the male takes a fair share in incubation (26.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not probable, as has already been remarked, that differences in colour between the sexes, when very slight, can be of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the female as a protection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Assuming, however, that they are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, they might be thought to be cases of transition; but we have no reason to believe that many species at any one time are undergoing change.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the family of pheasants the sexes of almost all the species are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully dissimilar, but are quite alike in the eared pheasant or Crossoptilon auritum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The laws of inheritance can alone account for the following cases, in which the female acquires, late in life, certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the male, and ultimately comes to resemble him more or less completely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth has observed with caged and wild birds, it is at first black and does not become red until the bird is at least a year old, at which age the sexes resemble each other in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) These cases must not be confounded with those where diseased or old females abnormally assume masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, nor with those where fertile females, whilst young, acquire the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the male, through variation or some unknown cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have endeavoured in this chapter to shew that the arguments are not trustworthy in favour of the view that weapons, bright colours, and various ornaments, are now confined to the males owing to the conversion, by natural selection, of the equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes, into transmission to the male sex alone.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must now consider the transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as limited by age, in reference to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and importance of the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages need not here be discussed, as enough has already been said on the subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals of all kinds when the adults differ in colour from the young, and the colours of the latter are not, as far as we can see, of any special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, they may generally be attributed, like various embryological structures, to the retention of a former <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again the young in the whole family of pigs (Suidae), and in certain rather distantly allied animals, such as the tapir, are marked with dark longitudinal stripes; but here we have a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> apparently derived from an extinct progenitor, and now preserved by the young alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This same principle applies to many birds belonging to various groups, in which the young closely resemble each other, and differ much from their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive adult parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The young of almost all the Gallinaceae, and of some distantly allied birds such as ostriches, are covered with longitudinally striped down; but this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> points back to a state of things so remote that it hardly concerns us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In almost the whole large group of thrushes the young have their breasts spotted--a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is retained throughout life by many species, but is quite lost by others, as by the Turdus migratorius.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again with many thrushes, the feathers on the back are mottled before they are moulted for the first time, and this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is retained for life by certain eastern species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to thrushes, shrikes, and woodpeckers, see Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Similar facts will hereafter be given in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to certain herons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Or the young may have an intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; or again they may differ greatly from the adults in both their seasonal plumages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) We see the same fact exhibited still more clearly in certain anomalous cases; thus the male of Heliothrix auriculata (one of the humming-birds) differs conspicuously from the female in having a splendid gorget and fine ear-tufts, but the female is remarkable from having a much longer tail than that of the male; now the young of both sexes resemble (with the exception of the breast being spotted with bronze) the adult female in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, including the length of her tail, so that the tail of the male actually becomes shorter as he reaches maturity, which is a most unusual circumstance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even in the anomalous cases of the Heliothrix and Mergus, it is probable that originally both adult sexes were furnished--the one species with a much elongated tail, and the other with a much elongated crest--these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s having since been partially lost by the adult males from some unexplained cause, and transmitted in their diminished state to their male offspring alone, when arrived at the corresponding age of maturity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Tanysiptera, Prof.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to closely-allied species which represent each other in distinct countries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> naturally arises, how is it that in these latter cases the winter plumage of both sexes, and in the former cases the plumage of the adult females, as well as the immature plumage of the young, have not been at all affected? The species which represent each other in distinct countries will almost always have been exposed to somewhat different conditions, but we can hardly attribute to this action the modification of the plumage in the males alone, seeing that the females and the young, though similarly exposed, have not been affected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this case sexual selection, which depends on an element liable to change--the taste or admiration of the female--will have had new shades of colour or other differences to act on and accumulate; and as sexual selection is always at work, it would (from what we know of the results on domestic animals of man's unintentional selection), be surprising if animals inhabiting separate districts, which can never cross and thus blend their newly-acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, were not, after a sufficient lapse of time, differently modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>papuana differ from each other more than do their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive males (7.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the differences between the females within the same genus, it appears to me almost certain, after looking through various large groups, that the chief agent has been the greater or less transference to the female of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by the males through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, we shall see that they differ from one another chiefly in the points in which they partially resemble their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive males; and the colours of the males may safely be attributed to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With many gallinaceous species the sexes differ to an extreme degree, as with the peacock, pheasant, and fowl, whilst with other species there has been a partial or even complete transference of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the male to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is no improbability in the plain, though peculiarly spotted plumage of this latter bird having been acquired through sexual selection by the males, and then transmitted to both sexes; for it is not essentially different from the much more beautifully spotted plumage, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the males alone of the Tragopan pheasants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It should be observed that, in some instances, the transference of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the male to the female has been effected apparently at a remote period, the male having subsequently undergone great changes, without transferring to the female any of his later-gained <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But since this period the male black-grouse has acquired his fine black plumage, with his forked and outwardly-curled tail-feathers; but of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s there has hardly been any transference to the female, excepting that she shews in her tail a trace of the curved fork.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may therefore conclude that the females of distinct though allied species have often had their plumage rendered more or less different by the transference in various degrees of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by the males through sexual selection, both during former and recent times.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In addition to the effects of the partial transference of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the males to the females, some of the differences between the females of closely allied species may be attributed to the direct or definite action of the conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The free intercrossing of the many individuals belonging to the same species would ultimately tend to make any change of colour, thus induced, uniform in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any variations which were of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the female as a protection would be at once obliterated, instead of being lost simply by not being selected, or from free intercrossing, or from being eliminated when transferred to the male and in any way injurious to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the plumage of the female would be kept constant in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would also be a relief if we could admit that the obscure tints of both sexes of many birds had been acquired and preserved for the sake of protection,--for example, of the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren (Accentor modularis and Troglodytes vulgaris), with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to which we have no sufficient evidence of the action of sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this view is not supported by any evidence, and is not probable; for we thus in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> expose during past times the females and the young to danger, from which it has subsequently been necessary to shield their modified descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Finally, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to our present class of cases, the most probable view appears to be that successive variations in brightness or in other ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, occurring in the males at a rather late period of life have alone been preserved; and that most or all of these variations, owing to the late period of life at which they appeared, have been from the first transmitted only to the adult male offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any variations in brightness occurring in the females or in the young, would have been of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them, and would not have been selected; and moreover, if dangerous, would have been eliminated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is no reason to doubt the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this assertion, which is supported by some observations made in China by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The female therefore of this species has acquired an eminently masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact is another striking instance of the law that secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are often widely different in closely-allied forms, though it is a very rare circumstance when such differences relate to the female sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) There is also reason to believe that the male undertakes the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of incubation, for Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>fulicarius undertakes the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of incubation; this is likewise shewn by the state of his breast- feathers during the breeding-season.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He not only performs the whole <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of incubation, but has to defend the young from their mother; "for as soon as she catches sight of her progeny she becomes violently agitated, and notwithstanding the resistance of the father appears to use her utmost endeavours to destroy them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case is very different with the African ostrich, for the male is somewhat larger than the female and has finer plumes with more strongly contrasted colours; nevertheless he undertakes the whole <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of incubation.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that in all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s this species comes under our first class of cases; but Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus an almost complete transposition of the instincts, habits, <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, colour, size, and of some points of structure, has been effected between the two sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The male and female of the splendid scarlet ibis are alike, whilst the young are brown; and the scarlet colour, though common to both sexes, is apparently a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for it is not well developed in either sex under confinement; and a loss of colour often occurs with brilliant males when they are confined.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With many species of herons the young differ greatly from the adults; and the summer plumage of the latter, though common to both sexes, clearly has a nuptial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The brilliant or conspicuous colours which <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise many birds in the present class, can rarely or never be of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them as a protection; so that they have probably been gained by the males through sexual selection, and then transferred to the females and the young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, possible that the males may have selected the more attractive females; and if these transmitted their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their offspring of both sexes, the same results would follow as from the selection of the more attractive males by the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, therefore, the most probable view that sexual selection has acted, in the present class, as far as ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are concerned, in accordance with the general rule throughout the animal kingdom, that is, on the males; and that these have transmitted their gradually-acquired colours, either equally or almost equally, to their offspring of both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In either case sexual selection must have acted on the male when he had to compete with rivals for the possession of the female; and in both cases the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus acquired have been transmitted to both sexes and all ages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s if acquired by the males when adult, may have been transmitted at first to the adults alone, and at some subsequent period transferred to the young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For it is known that, when the law of inheritance at corresponding ages fails, the offspring often inherit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared in their parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth for information in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to this genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I may here add that I have, with little success, endeavoured, by consulting various works, to decide how far the period of variation in birds has generally determined the transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to one sex or to both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Marshall with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the protuberances on the heads of birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett has informed me in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to gold pheasants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Swinhoe, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the immature males of Oriolus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) If the young of any species in their immature plumage were more successful in winning partners than the adults, the adult plumage would probably soon be lost, as the males would prevail, which retained their immature dress for the longest period, and thus the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the species would ultimately be modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Other animals, belonging to quite distinct classes, are either habitually or occasionally capable of breeding before they have fully acquired their adult <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All such facts are highly interesting, as bearing on one means by which species may undergo great modifications of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>OR THE YOUNG MAY HAVE AN INTERMEDIATE CHARACTER; OR, AGAIN, THEY MAY DIFFER GREATLY FROM THE ADULTS IN BOTH THEIR SEASONAL PLUMAGES.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the young differing greatly from both sexes in their adult summer and winter plumages, this occurs with some herons and egrets of North America and India,--the young alone being white.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>only in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s originally acquired by the males during the breeding-season, having been limited in their transmission to the corresponding season.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the adults have a distinct summer and winter plumage, and the young differ from both, the case is more difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A more probable explanation is, that an ancient style of plumage, partially modified through the transference of some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the summer plumage, has been retained by the adults during the winter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, all the cases in our present class apparently depend on <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by the adult males, having been variously limited in their transmission according to age, season, and sex; but it would not be worth while to attempt to follow out these complex relations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth, that the young of both sexes can be distinguished by this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> even as nestlings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In the young blackbird the wing- feathers assume their mature <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and become black after the others; on the other hand, in the two species just named the wing-feathers become blue before the others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, have transmitted their colours to their male offspring at an earlier age than that at which they were first acquired; for, if the males had varied whilst quite young, their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would probably have been transmitted to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is much difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how this could have been effected at the same time with the two sexes of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, we might assume that during some former lengthened period the males of the Juan Fernandez species had greatly exceeded the females in number, but that during another lengthened period the females had far exceeded the males, we could <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the males at one time, and the females at another, might have been rendered beautiful by the selection of the brighter coloured individuals of either sex; both sexes transmitting their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their young at a rather earlier age than usual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why variations have occurred at different periods of life, even sometimes with species of the same group, we do not know, but with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the form of transmission, one important determining cause seems to be the age at which the variations first appear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to birds which live on the ground, every one admits that they are coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tristram has remarked in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the inhabitants of the Sahara, that all are protected by their "isabelline or sand-colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tristram with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the birds of the Sahara, and he has kindly given me the following information.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When both sexes are so obscurely coloured that it would be rash to assume the agency of sexual selection, and when no direct evidence can be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d shewing that such colours serve as a protection, it is best to own complete ignorance of the cause, or, which comes to nearly the same thing, to attribute the result to the direct action of the conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the common blackbird, capercailzie, blackcock, black scoter-duck (Oidemia), and even with one of the birds of paradise (Lophorina atra), the males alone are black, whilst the females are brown or mottled; and there can hardly be a doubt that blackness in these cases has been a sexually selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Anastomus oscitans, we have still better evidence that the white plumage is a nuptial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for it is developed only during the summer; the young in their immature state, and the adults in their winter dress, being grey and black.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As sexual selection depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that, within the same group of birds having nearly the same habits, there should exist white or nearly white, as well as black, or nearly black species,--for instance, both white and black cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even in our own dress, the general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> lasts long, and the changes are to a certain extent graduated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, with savages such fashions do not endure for ever, as we may infer from the differences in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> between allied tribes on the same continent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again the raisers of fancy animals certainly have admired for many generations and still admire the same breeds; they earnestly desire slight changes, which are considered as <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments, but any great or sudden change is looked at as the greatest blemish.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to taste, which depends on many elements, but partly on habit and partly on a love of novelty, there seems no improbability in animals admiring for a very long period the same general style of ornamentation or other attractions, and yet appreciating slight changes in colours, form, or sound.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The males display their charms with elaborate <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and to the best effect; and this is done in the presence of the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They explain also in the most interesting manner how certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have originated, such as the indented ocelli on the tail-feathers of the peacock, and the ball-and-socket ocelli on the wing-feathers of the Argus pheasant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The laws of inheritance, ir<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively of selection, appear to have determined whether the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by the males for the sake of ornament, for producing various sounds, and for fighting together, have been transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes, either permanently, or periodically during certain seasons of the year.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s should have been transmitted sometimes in one way and sometimes in another, is not in most cases known; but the period of variability seems often to have been the determining cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the two sexes have inherited all <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in common they necessarily resemble each other; but as the successive variations may be differently transmitted, every possible gradation may be found, even within the same genus, from the closest similarity to the widest dissimilarity between the sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With many closely-allied species, following nearly the same habits of life, the males have come to differ from each other chiefly through the action of sexual selection; whilst the females have come to differ chiefly from partaking more or less of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus acquired by the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, through the law of the equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes, the females were rendered as conspicuously coloured as the males, their instincts appear often to have been modified so that they were led to build domed or concealed nests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In one small and curious class of cases the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and habits of the two sexes have been completely transposed, for the females are larger, stronger, more vociferous and brighter coloured than the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, as seems probable, such females habitually drive away their rivals, and by the display of their bright colours or other charms endeavour to attract the males, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that they have gradually been rendered, by sexual selection and sexually- limited transmission, more beautiful than the males--the latter being left unmodified or only slightly modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When variations in brightness or in other conspicuous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s occur early in life, as no doubt often happens, they will not be acted on through sexual selection until the period of reproduction arrives; consequently if dangerous to the young, they will be eliminated through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that variations arising late in life have so often been preserved for the ornamentation of the males; the females and the young being left almost unaffected, and therefore like each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With species having a distinct summer and winter plumage, the males of which either resemble or differ from the females during both seasons or during the summer alone, the degrees and kinds of resemblance between the young and the old are exceedingly complex; and this complexity apparently depends on <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, first acquired by the males, being transmitted in various ways and degrees, as limited by age, sex, and season.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the young of so many species have been but little modified in colour and in other ornaments, we are enabled to form some judgment with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the plumage of their early progenitors; and we may infer that the beauty of our existing species, if we look to the whole class, has been largely increased since that period, of which the immature plumage gives us an indirect record.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole, and from the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the following facts, it seems probable that when the various weapons differ in the two sexes, this has generally depended on the kind of transmission which has prevailed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the reindeer is the one species in the whole family of Deer, in which the female is furnished with horns, though they are somewhat smaller, thinner, and less branched than in the male, it might naturally be thought that, at least in this case, they must be of some special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to her.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As both sexes have the same requirements and follow the same habits of life, and as the male is destitute of horns during the winter, it is improbable that they can be of any special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the female during this season, which includes the larger part of the time during which she is horned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is it probable that she can have inherited horns from some ancient progenitor of the family of deer, for, from the fact of the females of so many species in all quarters of the globe not having horns, we may conclude that this was the primordial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>241, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the American variety or species: also Major W.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Other masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, besides the horns, are sometimes similarly transferred to the female; thus Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s we may conclude that the possession of fairly well-developed horns by the female reindeer, is due to the males having first acquired them as weapons for fighting with other males; and secondarily to their development from some unknown cause at an unusually early age in the males, and their consequent transference to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These several facts indicate that, with sheep, the horns are a much less firmly fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the females than in the males; and this leads us to look at the horns as properly of masculine origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to ordinary cattle Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact, as well as the possession of horns by both sexes, seems at first to prove that the horns in this species do not constitute a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> (17.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But why castration should lead to the reappearance of an early condition of the horns cannot be explained with any <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, it seems probable, that in nearly the same manner as the constitutional disturbance in the offspring, caused by a cross between two distinct species or races, often leads to the reappearance of long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (19.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These differences in the tusks of the several races and species of elephants--the great variability of the horns of deer, as notably in the wild reindeer--the occasional presence of horns in the female Antilope Bezoartica, and their frequent absence in the female of Antilocapra americana--the presence of two tusks in some few male narwhals--the complete absence of tusks in some female walruses--are all instances of the extreme variability of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and of their liability to differ in closely-allied forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The female cannot thus use her horns, which are smaller, but from her more quiet <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> she does not need this strange kind of shield so much.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>9) says that the American deer fight with their fore-feet, after "the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of superiority has been once settled and acknowledged in the herd.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>McNeill of Colonsay, who has long and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed the habits of red-deer, and he informs me that he has never seen some of the branches brought into use, but that the brow antlers, from inclining downwards, are a great protection to the forehead, and their points are likewise used in attack.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, the horns, like the splendid accoutrements of the knights of old, add to the noble appearance of stags and antelopes, they may have been modified partly for this purpose, though mainly for actual <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in battle; but I have no evidence in favour of this belief.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Male deer and antelopes, on the other hand, possess horns, and they rarely have canine teeth; and these, when present, are always of small size, so that it is doubtful whether they are of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in their battles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A single tusk of the Asiatic elephant--one of the extinct woolly species--and of the African elephant, have been known to weigh <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively 150, 160, and 180 pounds; and even greater weights have been given by some authors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The weights were ascertained by a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, Capt.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can be little doubt that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been gained, partly through sexual selection, owing to a long series of victories, by the stronger and more courageous males over the weaker, and partly through the inherited effects of use.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is probable that the successive variations in strength, size, and courage, whether due to mere variability or to the effects of use, by the accumulation of which male quadrupeds have acquired these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities, occurred rather late in life, and were consequently to a large extent limited in their transmission to the same sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s I was anxious to obtain information as to the Scotch deer-hound, the sexes of which differ more in size than those of any other breed (though blood-hounds differ considerably), or than in any wild canine species known to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As, however, the males do not attain their full dimensions until rather late in life, they will have tended, in accordance with the law often indicated, to transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to their male offspring alone; and thus the great inequality in size between the sexes of the Scotch deer-hound may probably be accounted for.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Does the female prefer any particular male, either before or after the males may have fought together for supremacy; or does the male, when not a polygamist, select any particular female? The general impression amongst breeders seems to be that the male accepts any female; and this owing to his eagerness, is, in most cases, probably the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the fourteenth chapter, on Birds, a considerable body of direct and indirect evidence was <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, shewing that the female selects her partner; and it would be a strange anomaly if female quadrupeds, which stand higher in the scale and have higher mental powers, did not generally, or at least often, exert some choice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This they do by taking them in their mouths and lifting them over the heads of the other females, and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully placing them in their own harem, carrying them as cats do their kittens.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two similar and trustworthy accounts have been given me in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to a female retriever and a spaniel, both of which became enamoured with terrier-dogs.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Barr, who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully bred many bloodhounds, states that in almost every instance particular individuals of opposite sexes shew a decided preference for each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cupples, after attending to this subject for another year, has written to me, "I have had full confirmation of my former statement, that dogs in breeding form decided preferences for each other, being often influenced by size, bright colour, and individual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as well as by the degree of their previous familiarity.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAMMALS--continued.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is possible that the roaring of the lion may be of some <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to him by striking terror into his adversary; for when enraged he likewise erects his mane and thus instinctively tries to make himself appear as terrible as possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it can hardly be supposed that the bellowing of the stag, even if it be of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to him in this way, can have been important enough to have led to the periodical enlargement of the throat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the case stands, the loud voice of the stag during the breeding-season does not seem to be of any special <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to him, either during his courtship or battles, or in any other way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The vocal organs of the American Mycetes caraya are one-third larger in the male than in the female, and are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully powerful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rank effluvium of the male goat is well known, and that of certain male deer is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully strong and persistent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This observer also gives some curious particulars in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the odour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] Male quadrupeds of many kinds differ from the females in having more hair, or hair of a different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, on certain parts of their faces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, what must we conclude with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to such sexual differences as these? No one will pretend that the beards of certain male goats, or the dewlaps of the bull, or the crests of hair along the backs of certain male antelopes, are of any use to them in their ordinary habits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Must we attribute all these appendages of hair or skin to mere purposeless variability in the male? It cannot be denied that this is possible; for in many domesticated quadrupeds, certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, apparently not derived through reversion from any wild parent form, are confined to the males, or are more developed in them than in the females-- for instance, the hump on the male zebu-cattle of India, the tail of fat- tailed rams, the arched outline of the forehead in the males of several breeds of sheep, and lastly, the mane, the long hairs on the hind legs, and the dewlap of the male of the Berbura goat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The mane, which occurs only in the rams of an African breed of sheep, is a true secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for, as I hear from Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although we ought to be extremely cautious, as shewn in my work on 'Variation under Domestication,' in concluding that any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, even with animals kept by semi-civilised people, has not been subjected to selection by man, and thus augmented, yet in the cases just specified this is improbable; more especially as the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are confined to the males, or are more strongly developed in them than in the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, is descended from the same stock as other goats, then, assuming that selection has not been applied to these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, they must be due to simple variability, together with sexually- limited inheritance.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>America, as well as the young of both sexes, do not possess the black stripes on the nose and the blackish-brown line on the breast, which are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the adult males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is on the whole probable that the strongly-marked colours and other ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of male quadrupeds are beneficial to them in their rivalry with other males, and have consequently been acquired through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view is strengthened by the differences in colour between the sexes occurring almost exclusively, as may be collected from the previous details, in those groups and sub-groups of mammals which present other and strongly-marked secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; these being likewise due to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, however, a striking parallelism between mammals and birds in all their secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, namely in their weapons for fighting with rival males, in their ornamental appendages, and in their colours.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both classes the male assumes the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to his sex shortly before the age of reproduction; and if emasculated at an early period, loses them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering this parallelism, there can be little doubt that the same cause, whatever it may be, has acted on mammals and birds; and the result, as far as ornamental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are concerned, may be attributed, as it appears to me, to the long-continued preference of the individuals of one sex for certain individuals of the opposite sex, combined with their success in leaving a larger number of offspring to inherit their superior attractions.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hyomoschus, also, offers one of those interesting cases of a form linking together two groups, for it is intermediate in certain osteological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s between the pachyderms and ruminants, which were formerly thought to be quite distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we admit that coloured spots and stripes were first acquired as ornaments, how comes it that so many existing deer, the descendants of an aboriginally spotted animal, and all the species of pigs and tapirs, the descendants of an aboriginally striped animal, have lost in their adult state their former ornaments? I cannot satisfactorily answer this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many species are coloured either in so extraordinary or so beautiful a manner, and are furnished with such curious and elegant crests of hair, that we can hardly avoid looking at these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as having been gained for the sake of ornament.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The naked skin of the face differs <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully in colour in the various species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In these and many other monkeys, the beauty and singular arrangement of their colours, and still more the diversified and elegant arrangement of the crests and tufts of hair on their heads, force the conviction on my mind that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been acquired through sexual selection exclusively as ornaments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That conspicuous and diversified colours, whether confined to the males or common to both sexes, are as a general rule associated in the same groups and sub-groups with other secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s serving for war or for ornament, will be found to hold good, if we look back to the various cases given in this and the last chapter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The law of the equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes, as far as colour and other ornaments are concerned, has prevailed far more extensively with mammals than with birds; but weapons, such as horns and tusks, have often been transmitted either exclusively or much more perfectly to the males than to the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is surprising, for, as the males generally use their weapons for defence against enemies of all kinds, their weapons would have been of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the females.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As with animals of all classes, so with man, the distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the male sex are not fully developed until he is nearly mature; and if emasculated they never appear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The beard, for instance, is a secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and male children are beardless, though at an early age they have abundant hair on the head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is probably due to the rather late appearance in life of the successive variations whereby man has acquired his masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, that they are transmitted to the male sex alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The female, however, ultimately assumes certain distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and in the formation of her skull, is said to be intermediate between the child and the man.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even in so trifling a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as the greater prominence of the superciliary ridge, the males of certain monkeys differ from the females (8.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), and agree in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> with mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the general hairiness of the body, the women in all races are less hairy than the men; and in some few Quadrumana the under side of the body of the female is less hairy than that of the male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of man are highly variable, even within the limits of the same race; and they differ much in the several races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Numerous measurements were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully made of the stature, the circumference of the neck and chest, the length of the back-bone and of the arms, in various races; and nearly all these measurements shew that the males differ much more from one another than do the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact indicates that, as far as these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are concerned, it is the male which has been chiefly modified, since the several races diverged from their common stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, which there is every reason to believe were primarily gained through sexual selection by one sex, have been transferred to the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As this same form of transmission has apparently prevailed much with mankind, it will save useless repetition if we discuss the origin of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s peculiar to the male sex together with certain other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s common to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The jaws, together with their muscles, would then have been reduced through disuse, as would the teeth through the not well understood principles of correlation and economy of growth; for we everywhere see that parts, which are no longer of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, are reduced in size.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would, however, have been preserved or even augmented during the long ages of man's savagery, by the success of the strongest and boldest men, both in the general struggle for life and in their contests for wives; a success which would have ensured their leaving a more numerous progeny than their less favoured brethren.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to differences of this nature between man and woman, it is probable that sexual selection has played a highly important part.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am aware that some writers doubt whether there is any such inherent difference; but this is at least probable from the analogy of the lower animals which present other secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one disputes that the bull differs in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> from the cow, the wild-boar from the sow, the stallion from the mare, and, as is well known to the keepers of menageries, the males of the larger apes from the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Woman seems to differ from man in mental <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, chiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfishness; and this holds good even with savages, as shewn by a well-known passage in Mungo Park's Travels, and by statements made by many other travellers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is generally admitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the lower races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shewn by man's attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman--whether requiring deep thought, reason, or <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, or merely the use of the senses and hands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to avoid enemies or to attack them with success, to capture wild animals, and to fashion weapons, requires the aid of the higher mental faculties, namely, observation, reason, invention, or <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this view of genius is perhaps deficient; for without the higher powers of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> and reason, no eminent success can be gained in many subjects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These latter faculties, as well as the former, will have been developed in man, partly through sexual selection,--that is, through the contest of rival males, and partly through natural selection, that is, from success in the general struggle for life; and as in both cases the struggle will have been during maturity, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s gained will have been transmitted more fully to the male than to the female offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, indeed, fortunate that the law of the equal transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to both sexes prevails with mammals; otherwise, it is probable that man would have become as superior in mental endowment to woman, as the peacock is in ornamental plumage to the peahen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must be borne in mind that the tendency in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by either sex late in life, to be transmitted to the same sex at the same age, and of early acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to be transmitted to both sexes, are rules which, though general, do not always hold.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order that woman should reach the same standard as man, she ought, when nearly adult, to be trained to energy and perseverance, and to have her reason and <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> exercised to the highest point; and then she would probably transmit these qualities chiefly to her adult daughters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An observation by Vogt bears on this subject: he says, "It is a remarkable circumstance, that the difference between the sexes, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the cranial cavity, increases with the development of the race, so that the male European excels much more the female, than the negro the negress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the cause of this difference between the sexes, I have nothing to add to the remarks in the last chapter on the probable effects of the long-continued use of the vocal organs by the male under the excitement of love, rage and jealousy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The capacity and love for singing or music, though not a sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in man, must not here be passed over.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence when the primeval members of this class were strongly excited and their muscles violently contracted, purposeless sounds would almost certainly have been produced; and these, if they proved in any way <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, might readily have been modified or intensified by the preservation of properly adapted variations.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" As I have attempted to shew in an early chapter of this work, this principle has an important bearing on the acquisition by man of some of his mental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All these facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to music and impassioned speech become intelligible to a certain extent, if we may assume that musical tones and rhythm were used by our half-human ancestors, during the season of courtship, when animals of all kinds are excited not only by love, but by the strong passions of jealousy, rivalry, and triumph.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that music, dancing, song, and poetry are such very ancient arts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If it can be shewn that the men of different races prefer women having various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics, or conversely with the women, we have then to enquire whether such choice, continued during many generations, would produce any sensible effect on the race, either on one sex or both according to the form of inheritance which has prevailed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the women are made by savages to perform the greatest share of the work, and as they are not allowed to eat the best kinds of food, so it accords with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic selfishness of man that they should not be allowed to obtain, or use the finest ornaments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have heard it maintained that savages are quite indifferent about the beauty of their women, valuing them solely as slaves; it may therefore be well to observe that this conclusion does not at all agree with the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which the women take in ornamenting themselves, or with their vanity.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, therefore, not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that "beauty, according to our notion, is a stranger to them.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The same principle comes into play in the art of breeding; and we can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, as I have elsewhere explained (74.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful development of the many races of animals and plants, which have been kept merely for ornament.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fanciers always wish each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to be somewhat increased; they do not admire a medium standard; they certainly do not desire any great and abrupt change in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their breeds; they admire solely what they are accustomed to, but they ardently desire to see each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic feature a little more developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is certainly not true that there is in the mind of man any universal standard of beauty with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the human body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to; they cannot endure any great change; but they like variety, and admire each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic carried to a moderate extreme.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence a perfect beauty, which implies many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s modified in a particular manner, will be in every race a prodigy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If all our women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de' Medici, we should for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety; and as soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common standard.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF MAN--continued.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must next inquire whether this preference and the consequent selection during many generations of those women, which appear to the men of each race the most attractive, has altered the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> either of the females alone, or of both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With mammals the general rule appears to be that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of all kinds are inherited equally by the males and females; we might therefore expect that with mankind any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s gained by the females or by the males through sexual selection would commonly be transferred to the offspring of both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the opposite form of selection, namely, of the more attractive men by the women, although in civilised nations women have free or almost free choice, which is not the case with barbarous races, yet their choice is largely influenced by the social position and wealth of the men; and the success of the latter in life depends much on their intellectual powers and energy, or on the fruits of these same powers in their forefathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), we can also thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> "the necessity of expiation for marriage as an infringement of tribal rites, since according to old ideas, a man had no right to appropriate to himself that which belonged to the whole tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The pairing may not last for life, but only for each birth; yet if the males which are the strongest and best able to defend or otherwise <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> their females and young, were to select the more attractive females, this would suffice for sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The incessant crossing, however, between tribe and tribe, which necessarily follows from any form of this habit, would tend to keep all the people inhabiting the same country nearly uniform in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and this would interfere with the power of sexual selection in differentiating the tribes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Azara, for instance, describes how <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully a Guana woman bargains for all sorts of privileges, before accepting some one or more husbands; and the men in consequence take unusual <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of their personal appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>21) makes precisely the same remark in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the wild Indians of South America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At this early period the ancestors of man would not be sufficiently <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in intellect to look forward to distant contingencies; they would not foresee that the rearing of all their children, especially their female children, would make the struggle for life severer for the tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus during these times all the conditions for sexual selection would have been more favourable than at a later period, when man had <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in his intellectual powers but had retrograded in his instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" We have seen that each race has its own style of beauty, and we know that it is natural to man to admire each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic point in his domestic animals, dress, ornaments, and personal appearance, when carried a little beyond the average.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If then the several foregoing propositions be admitted, and I cannot see that they are doubtful, it would be an inexplicable circumstance if the selection of the more attractive women by the more powerful men of each tribe, who would rear on an average a greater number of children, did not after the lapse of many generations somewhat modify the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When a foreign breed of our domestic animals is introduced into a new country, or when a native breed is long and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to, either for use or ornament, it is found after several generations to have undergone a greater or less amount of change whenever the means of comparison exist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again, if during many years two <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeders rear animals of the same family, and do not compare them together or with a common standard, the animals are found to have become, to the surprise of their owners, slightly different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Each breeder has impressed, as von Nathusius well expresses it, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his own mind--his own taste and judgment--on his animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals in a state of nature, many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the males, such as size, strength, special weapons, courage and pugnacity, have been acquired through the law of battle.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Women, however, certainly transmit most of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, including some beauty, to their offspring of both sexes; so that the continued preference by the men of each race for the more attractive women, according to their standard of taste, will have tended to modify in the same manner all the individuals of both sexes belonging to the race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the other form of sexual selection (which with the lower animals is much the more common), namely, when the females are the selectors, and accept only those males which excite or charm them most, we have reason to believe that it formerly acted on our progenitors.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Preference on the part of the women, steadily acting in any one direction, would ultimately affect the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the tribe; for the women would generally choose not merely the handsomest men, according to their standard of taste, but those who were at the same time best able to defend and support them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will now examine a little more closely some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which distinguish the several races of man from one another and from the lower animals, namely, the greater or less deficiency of hair on the body, and the colour of the skin.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The absence of hair on the body is to a certain extent a secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; for in all parts of the world women are less hairy than men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore we may reasonably suspect that this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has been gained through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the body in woman is less hairy than in man, and as this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is common to all races, we may conclude that it was our female semi-human ancestors who were first divested of hair, and that this occurred at an extremely remote period before the several races had diverged from a common stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whilst our female ancestors were gradually acquiring this new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of nudity, they must have transmitted it almost equally to their offspring of both sexes whilst young; so that its transmission, as with the ornaments of many mammals and birds, has not been limited either by sex or age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is nothing surprising in a partial loss of hair having been <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed as an ornament by our ape-like progenitors, for we have seen that innumerable strange <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been thus <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed by animals of all kinds, and have consequently been gained through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is it surprising that a slightly injurious <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> should have been thus acquired; for we know that this is the case with the plumes of certain birds, and with the horns of certain stags.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the completion of the process through sexual selection, it is well to bear in mind the New Zealand proverb, "There is no woman for a hairy man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the king of Siam had to bribe a man to marry the first hairy woman in the family; and she transmitted this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to her young offspring of both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is more probable that the hairiness of the former is due to partial reversion; for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have been at some former period long inherited are always apt to return.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have seen that idiots are often very hairy, and they are apt to revert in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to a lower animal type.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>568:--Observations were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully made on the hairiness of 2129 black and coloured soldiers, whilst they were bathing; and by looking to the published table, "it is manifest at a glance that there is but little, if any, difference between the white and the black races in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It should be particularly observed, that both pure blacks and mulattoes were included in the above enumeration; and this is an unfortunate circumstance, as in accordance with a principle, the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of which I have elsewhere proved, crossed races of man would be eminently liable to revert to the primordial hairy <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their early ape-like progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the laws of inheritance are so complex that we can seldom <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> their action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hardly any view <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in this work has met with so much disfavour (see for instance, Sprengel, 'Die Fortschritte des Darwinismus,' 1874, p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>80) as the above explanation of the loss of hair in mankind through sexual selection; but none of the opposed arguments seem to me of much weight, in comparison with the facts shewing that the nudity of the skin is to a certain extent a secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in man and in some of the Quadrumana.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the beard in man, if we turn to our best guide, the Quadrumana, we find beards equally developed in both sexes of many species, but in some, either confined to the males, or more developed in them than in the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In opposition to this view of the retention of the beard from an early period is the fact of its great variability in different races, and even within the same race; for this indicates reversion,--long lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being very apt to vary on re-appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) has a more direct bearing on the present <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; for he has shewn that the motmots, which are known habitually to bite off the barbs of the two central tail- feathers, have the barbs of these feathers naturally somewhat reduced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The best kind of evidence that in man the colour of the skin has been modified through sexual selection is scanty; for in most races the sexes do not differ in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, and only slightly, as we have seen, in others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We know, however, from the many facts already given that the colour of the skin is <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by the men of all races as a highly important element in their beauty; so that it is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which would be likely to have been modified through selection, as has occurred in innumerable instances with the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the order of development during growth, generally indicates the order in which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of a species have been developed and modified during previous generations; and as the newly- born infants of the various races of man do not differ nearly as much in colour as do the adults, although their bodies are as completely destitute of hair, we have some slight evidence that the tints of the different races were acquired at a period subsequent to the removal of the hair, which must have occurred at a very early period in the history of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The females apparently first had their bodies denuded of hair, also as a sexual ornament; but they transmitted this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> almost equally to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not improbable that the females were modified in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s for the same purpose and by the same means; so that women have acquired sweeter voices and become more beautiful than men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It deserves attention that with mankind the conditions were in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s much more favourable for sexual selection, during a very early period, when man had only just attained to the rank of manhood, than during later times.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The views here <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, on the part which sexual selection has played in the history of man, want scientific <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who does not admit this agency in the case of the lower animals, will dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> all that I have written in the later chapters on man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We cannot positively say that this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but not that, has been thus modified; it has, however, been shewn that the races of man differ from each other and from their nearest allies, in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them in their daily habits of life, and which it is extremely probable would have been modified through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have seen that with the lowest savages the people of each tribe admire their own <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities,--the shape of the head and face, the squareness of the cheek- bones, the prominence or depression of the nose, the colour of the skin, the length of the hair on the head, the absence of hair on the face and body, or the presence of a great beard, and so forth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence these and other such points could hardly fail to be slowly and gradually exaggerated, from the more powerful and able men in each tribe, who would succeed in rearing the largest number of offspring, having selected during many generations for their wives the most strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised and therefore most attractive women.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many of the views which have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove erroneous; but I have in every case given the reasons which have led me to one view rather than to another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness: and when this is done, one path towards error is closed and the road to <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is often at the same time opened.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They have long been known, but until recently they told us nothing with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Something may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the surrounding conditions of life, such as abundant food, heat or moisture; and lastly, many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of slight physiological importance, some indeed of considerable importance, have been gained through sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt man, as well as every other animal, presents structures, which seem to our limited knowledge, not to be now of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to him, nor to have been so formerly, either for the general conditions of life, or in the relations of one sex to the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may hope hereafter to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> something about the causes of such occasional modifications, especially through the study of monstrosities: hence the labours of experimentalists, such as those of M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless all the races agree in so many unimportant details of structure and in so many mental peculiarities that these can be accounted for only by inheritance from a common progenitor; and a progenitor thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised would probably deserve to rank as man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to modifications acquired independently of selection, and due to variations arising from the nature of the organism and the action of the surrounding conditions, or from changed habits of life, no single pair will have been modified much more than the other pairs inhabiting the same country, for all will have been continually blended through free intercrossing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By considering the embryological structure of man,--the homologies which he presents with the lower animals,--the rudiments which he retains,--and the reversions to which he is liable, we can partly recall in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> the former condition of our early progenitors; and can approximately place them in their proper place in the zoological series.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The high standard of our intellectual powers and moral <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> is the greatest difficulty which presents itself, after we have been driven to this conclusion on the origin of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But every one who admits the principle of evolution, must see that the mental powers of the higher animals, which are the same in kind with those of man, though so different in degree, are capable of <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed, as soon as the half-art and half-instinct of language came into use; for the continued use of language will have reacted on the brain and produced an inherited effect; and this again will have reacted on the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of language.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) has well remarked, the largeness of the brain in man relatively to his body, compared with the lower animals, may be attributed in chief part to the early use of some simple form of language,--that <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful engine which affixes signs to all sorts of objects and qualities, and excites trains of thought which would never arise from the mere impression of the senses, or if they did arise could not be followed out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, probably follow from the continued <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment and exercise of the other mental faculties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These instincts are highly complex, and in the case of the lower animals give special tendencies towards certain definite actions; but the more important elements are love, and the distinct emotion of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in the fourth chapter I have endeavoured to shew that the moral sense follows, firstly, from the enduring and ever-present nature of the social instincts; secondly, from man's appreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of his fellows; and thirdly, from the high activity of his mental faculties, with past impressions extremely vivid; and in these latter <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s he differs from the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The appreciation and the bestowal of praise and blame both rest on <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>; and this emotion, as we have seen, is one of the most important elements of the social instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sympathy, though gained as an instinct, is also much strengthened by exercise or habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the reasoning powers <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> and experience is gained, the remoter effects of certain lines of conduct on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the individual, and on the general good, are perceived; and then the self-<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing virtues come within the scope of public opinion, and receive praise, and their opposites blame.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But with the less civilised nations reason often errs, and many bad customs and base superstitions come within the same scope, and are then <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed as high virtues, and their breach as heavy crimes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The moral faculties are generally and justly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed as of higher value than the intellectual powers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whatever renders the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> more vivid and strengthens the habit of recalling and comparing past impressions, will make the conscience more sensitive, and may even somewhat compensate for weak social affections and sympathies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The moral nature of man has reached its present standard, partly through the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment of his reasoning powers and consequently of a just public opinion, but especially from his sympathies having been rendered more tender and widely diffused through the effects of habit, example, instruction, and reflection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the more civilised races, the conviction of the existence of an all-seeing Deity has had a potent influence on the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of morality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless the first foundation or origin of the moral sense lies in the social instincts, including <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>; and these instincts no doubt were primarily gained, as in the case of the lower animals, through natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The belief in God has often been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in man's reason, and from a still greater <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in his faculties of <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, curiosity and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who believes in the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment of man from some low organised form, will naturally ask how does this bear on the belief in the immortality of the soul.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing revolts at such a conclusion, whether or not we are able to believe that every slight variation of structure,--the union of each pair in marriage, the dissemination of each seed,--and other such events, have all been ordained for some special purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the lower divisions of the animal kingdom, sexual selection seems to have done nothing: such animals are often affixed for life to the same spot, or have the sexes combined in the same individual, or what is still more important, their perceptive and intellectual faculties are not sufficiently <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d to allow of the feelings of love and jealousy, or of the exertion of choice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In almost every great class a few anomalous cases occur, where there has been an almost complete transposition of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the two sexes; the females assuming <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which properly belong to the males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The laws of inheritance determine whether <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s gained through sexual selection by either sex shall be transmitted to the same sex, or to both; as well as the age at which they shall be developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, when equally transmitted to both sexes can be distinguished from ordinary specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s only by the light of analogy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The belief in the power of sexual selection rests chiefly on the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are confined to one sex; and this alone renders it probable that in most cases they are connected with the act of reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In innumerable instances these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are fully developed only at maturity, and often during only a part of the year, which is always the breeding-season.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is to be especially observed that the males display their attractions with elaborate <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in the presence of the females; and that they rarely or never display them excepting during the season of love.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bearing in mind these facts, and the marked results of man's unconscious selection, when applied to domesticated animals and cultivated plants, it seems to me almost certain that if the individuals of one sex were during a long series of generations to prefer pairing with certain individuals of the other sex, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised in some peculiar manner, the offspring would slowly but surely become modified in this same manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless I know of no fact in natural history more <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful than that the female Argus pheasant should appreciate the exquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing-feather of the male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I differ only in the conviction that the male Argus pheasant acquired his beauty gradually, through the preference of the females during many generations for the more highly ornamented males; the aesthetic capacity of the females having been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d through exercise or habit, just as our own taste is gradually <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the male through the fortunate chance of a few feathers being left unchanged, we can distinctly trace how simple spots with a little fulvous shading on one side may have been developed by small steps into the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful ball-and-socket ornaments; and it is probable that they were actually thus developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If he accepts these conclusions he may, I think, safely extend them to mankind; but it would be superfluous here to repeat what I have so lately said on the manner in which sexual selection apparently has acted on man, both on the male and female side, causing the two sexes to differ in body and mind, and the several races to differ from each other in various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as well as from their ancient and lowly-organised progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man scans with scrupulous <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and pedigree of his horses, cattle, and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to his own marriage he rarely, or never, takes any such <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Everyone does good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, who aids towards this end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for their children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness in marriage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man, like every other animal, has no doubt <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d to his present high condition through a struggle for existence consequent on his rapid multiplication; and if he is to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> still higher, it is to be feared that he must remain subject to a severe struggle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the moral qualities are <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, either directly or indirectly, much more through the effects of habit, the reasoning powers, instruction, religion, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> creature flows in his veins.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But we are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only with the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> as far as our reason permits us to discover it; and I have given the evidence to the best of my ability.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>st living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system--with all these exalted powers--Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had, however, at that time no evidence of monkeys exhibiting this part of their bodies during their courtship; and such display in the case of birds affords the best evidence that the ornaments of the males are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them by attracting or exciting the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>von Fischer, of Gotha, published in 'Der Zoologische Garten,' April 1876, on the expression of monkeys under various emotions, which is well worthy of study by any one interested in the subject, and which shews that the author is a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and acute observer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He says that he was himself at first perplexed by the above action, and was thus led <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to observe several individuals of various other species of monkeys, which he has long kept in his house.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The individuals, however, of the same species vary in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, and some which were very shy never displayed their hinder ends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of the habit, Von Fischer remarks that his monkeys like to have their naked hinder ends patted or stroked, and that they then grunt with pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They often also turn this part of their bodies to other monkeys to have bits of dirt picked off, and so no doubt it would be with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to thorns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact that it is only the monkeys thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised which, as far as at present known, act in this manner as a greeting towards other monkeys renders it doubtful whether the habit was first acquired from some independent cause, and that afterwards the parts in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> were coloured as a sexual ornament; or whether the colouring and the habit of turning round were first acquired through variation and sexual selection, and that afterwards the habit was retained as a sign of pleasure or as a greeting, through the principle of inherited association.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Consequently the whole body of males inhabiting the same country would tend from the effects of constant intercrossing to become modified almost uniformly, but sometimes a little more in one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and sometimes in another, though at an extremely slow rate; all ultimately being thus rendered more attractive to the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor does the belief appear to me altogether fanciful that two sets of females, surrounded by a very different environment, would be apt to acquire somewhat different tastes with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to form, sound, or colour.</li>
