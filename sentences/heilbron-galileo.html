<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To be sure, Galileo enjoyed such epithets as "divine mathematician" and "Tuscan Archimedes," and he spent the first half of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, from 1589 to 1610, as a professor of mathematics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He was a true connoisseur of the arts and sciences, able, says Viviani, to talk intelligently, and with apt quotations, on virtually every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able subject with all sorts of people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This indulgence, coupled with an inventive wit and the adolescent pleasure, which he never outgrew, of scoring off people, made him powerful enemies even among those who <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed his gifts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He never made much use of algebra, disliked compli­ cated calculations of the sort that delighted Kepler, and avoided geometrical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s more difficult than those with which he debuted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> As a young man, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>free despite the family's straitened finances, <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed by friends from among the best families in Florence, clever, witty, sociable, versed in literature and music, and with a gift for geometry and a taste for gambling, Galileo did not resemble much the troubled inventor of modern science familiar from the usual histories.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That makes space for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> development.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Restoring to Galileo his youth in Pisa and Florence, his maturation in Padua, and his megalomaniacal middle age in the Medici court not only gives his history what he might have called momento but also <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s to fix his role as hero of the Scientific Revolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had friends, enemies, and correspondents of all sorts: mathematicians, philoso­ phers, literary people, bureaucrats, princes, cardinals, and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from  viii PREFACE the heroic poems he knew almost by heart.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A genealogical table of the Galilei and a glossary of most people mentioned in the text apart from such household names as Einstein and God, but including <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from Ariosto and Tasso, follow Chapter VIII.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> On the contrary: the main obstacle to overcome in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing Calileo's work is thinking that he was engaged in the same enterprise as modern physicists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Failure to appreciate that his genre was not ours has prompted many unnecessary arguments and mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ings, which it will be a pleasure not to review here.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> It is a great pleasure to thank colleagues for their <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> and support, not only in customary acknowledgment of debt, but also in gratitude that, despite fashionable widespread cynicism about the academy, generosity and encouragement abound in some corners of the Republic of Letters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> in keeping in touch with the wider society I thank, and apologize to, everyone who has listened to my nascent notions about Galileo, especially my wife and sounding board, Alison Browning, my advisor on Venetian courtesans, Wanda Case-Goody, and the Friday night regulars at the Rose & Crown in the Oxfordshire village of Shilton.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>3 CHARACTER ANALYSIS 1 5 16 2 A Tuscan Archimedes 2.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The story lacks a week of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had little interest in the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d planetary astronomy of Tycho and Kepler.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was not an innovator by <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The choice of com­ pliment, "gabrina," adds verisimilitude to the story; the nasty ugly old witch Gabrina is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in Ariosto's Orlando furioso, which Vincenzo admired as much as Galileo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Like Gabrina, Giulia did not <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> with age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is suggestive that the main <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> he put to the horoscopes he cast for his daughters was how rational they would be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" That the price of bread for Galileo should have been a <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> suggests that playing the lute in all possible places had not made Vincenzo wealthy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Each taught a rigid Aristotelianism without agreeing on its prin­ ciples, although both had a deep <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for the <strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong> of the philosophy they interpreted and a deep disdain for the compromises required to subject Greek philosophy to Christian theology," Accordingly, they had no patience with the system of Thomas Aquinas, then recently recognized by the Coun­ cil of Trent as official Catholic teaching and enthusiastically so received by the Dominicans and the Jesuits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Among its hangers-on was a mathemati­ cian, Ostilio Ricci, who would end his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as mathematician to the Grand Duke Ferdinando I.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some well-placed math­ ematicians were arguing, occasionally successfully, that their work deserved greater <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> than philosophers accorded it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Three of these mathematicians were important for Galileo's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He would support Galileo's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er and the mathema­ ticians at the Roman College would <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> it-up to a point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He and his brother, Francesco Maria del Monte, no mathematician but, as a cardinal, a powerful patron, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to impose Galileo on the University of Pisa as its lecturer in mathematics in 1589.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s how tall Socrates was? Quantitative accidents-dates, scores, balance sheets-annoy and bore most people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still, although the height of Socrates does not signify, that of the pole star does; and since knowledge of it allows us to navigate, it must relate to some sort of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Another unexceptionable example of the sometime <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of math­ ematics frequently invoked at the time argued from the spherical shape of the earth to the conclusion that the sun cannot shine on its entire surface at once.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It was no less a <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> if argued the other way around, from the limited illumination to the spherical shape.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> natu­ rally arose whether mathematics made use of the demonstratio potissima.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> How could that axiom be a proper definition or representation of the essence of triangles, which cannot be constructed from parallel lines?" Most people interested in such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in the sixteenth century denied that mathematics met the standard of the demonstratio potissima because it could not establish its premises by the intuitive <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> of sense experience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Consideration of these life-and­ death <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s added excitement to the existence of a mathematician.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If granted equality in <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> and relevance with physics, mathematics might be the Archimedean lever with which, if he could find a place to put it, a math­ ematician might move the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Among the many cultural gurus who <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed develop his taste and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during the four years he lived at home between leaving  A FLORENTINE EDUCATION 9 Pisa without a degree and returning as a professor, the most influential was his father.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They agree as a condition of the discussion that "we always set aside (as Aristotle says in the eighth book of the Physics) not only authority but seemingly plausible reasoning that may be contrary to any perception of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Vincenzo Galilei was a theorist of <strong style='color: red'>integrity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ptolemy had succumbed to a numerology that appeared to secure a tuning based on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ization of musical intervals by the dif­ ferent lengths of otherwise identical vibrating strings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Vincenzo probably had Galileo's <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> in the refinement of the experiments that underlay these ratios.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The  A FLORENTINE EDUCATION 11 best that can be done when instruments play together or accompany singers is to forget the perfect ratios of the various modes and tune everything to equal <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Galileo had had any money, he would have faced the same <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er choice as Strozzi did: marriage, church, or court.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would be <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful when Galileo undertook to instruct the papal court on astronomy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His pertinent extant com­ positions include two handfuls of poems, extensive "Notes" on Petrarca's Rime and Ariosto's Furioso, "Considerations" on the Gerusalemme liberata of Torquato Tasso, outlines for a play, and, though neither poetry nor criti­ cism, two lectures on Dante's Inferno, almost none of them published in their time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galileo's notes and <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s supplied weapons for himself and his friends for deployment in the Italian theatre of the warfare between ancients and moderns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here is a specimen, in which a couplet of Galileian <strong style='color: red'>inventiveness</strong> follows a Petrarchan opening, and the rest proceeds on stand­ ard lines: Now that the sun has plunged, its golden curls ablaze, Into Ocean's waves against Iberia's shores, The alleyways discharge a multitude of whores In beautiful platoons attracting every gaze.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The anonymous editor of the "Considerations on Tasso" who wrote at the end of the eight­ eenth century allowed that most of Galileo's criticisms were sound and that, if reduced to system, "they would constitute a science of action in poetry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"? Several selections of Calileo's writings compiled to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> Italian children learn to write and think contain ample excerpts from his literary criticism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Granting that it is a poem, is it a tragedy, comedy, or epic? Dante called it a comedy, and so it is, because it contains low <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and ends happily.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>57 Strozzi's friend Don Giovanni, an illegitimate son of Cosimo I, was a poeti­ cal engineer, musician, alchemist, and astrologer, a man of immense reach, <strong style='color: red'>tolerant</strong> enough to befriend his Jewish librarian and brave enough to chal­ lenge Galileo over some problems in applied mathematics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Strozzi, also a lifetime defender of Dante, praised Mazzoni's lectures as "full of profound and <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous ideas;" the Alterati elected him a member; and Grand Duke Ferdinando demanded that he accept a professorship at Pisa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He can imitate the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, even in matters scientific, philosophic, and theologi­ cal, provided that he does it poetically, that is, with accessible and credible images.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Concerning this I have written at length in my new book [Della difesa della Commedia di Dante, available at all good book stores], where I also show with what tact Dante has at times introduced either a philosopher or a theologian to discuss matters pertinent to the contemplative sciences in an <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>able fashion, never deviating from the credible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>3 CHARACTER ANALYSIS Critical insights As the Dante dispute culminated, the practiced Florentine academicians undertook to judge the relative merits of Ariosto and Tasso.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The Furi­ oso is a mixture of Greek myth and medieval romance, and, by operation of its magic, of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, and fuller than any of them with episodes that do not <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> its scarcely discernible plot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bradamante <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d the paradox: if the earlier guest had been more beautiful than she, would she have had to leave? The answer can be found at the end of canto 32.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>68 The <strong style='color: red'>inventiveness</strong>, irony, and liveliness of Ariosto's beautifully told tall tales made them immensely popular.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d whether the Furioso, the high entertainment of the age, sinned against the conven­ tions? Tasso's admirers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tasso's crusaders are not perfect; their heroism stutters, they suffer from un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>, indecision, the human condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?' Later critics tend to agree with Galileo's censure of Tasso's prolixity and misplaced grandiloquence, although they do not enter into conversation with him and his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as Galileo did.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?' Galileo's "Considerations on Tasso" often parallel the discussions at the academies, even in their more whimsical parts, although with a bite that has caused his later admirers puzzlement and even embarrassment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Calileo's cuts and thrusts should be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as material for sprightly debates among brash young literary men, private notes for knockdown confrontations with members of the Alterati, who tended to favor Tasso, not formal literary criti­ cism for later depth analysis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He could play very well-against Ariosto as well as Tasso-the Florentine game of culling barbarisms, Latinisms, inept words, pedanticisms, stuffing, lard, veneer," Calileo's substantive criticism of Tasso may provide deeper insights into his than into the poet's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I've always thought that this poet is, in his inven­ tions, above all mean, poor, and miserable, whereas Ariosto is magnificent, rich, and <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>and a great many vases of crystal, agate, lapis lazuli, and other gems, full to overflowing with precious, <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous things, all excel­ lent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?" From which we may infer that Galileo prized <strong style='color: red'>inventiveness</strong> when it produced great and beautiful things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pedestrian <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s or out-of-the-way oddities meant nothing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would observe this principle in holding back his small or partial discoveries until the telescope revealed to him the greatest <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s of the age, and in recommending some of his nicer geometry and cosmological speculations as <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The scene in Armida's pleasure garden just before the arrival of two knights sent by Godfrey to remind Rinaldo of his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> contains the line, "She swoons in his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ss I cheeks flushed and bare I While silver beads of sweat their charms enhance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galileo: "A <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous description of female behavior: and this is one of the reasons that most women prefer people of lower condition to men held in high <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ariosto's <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s seem realistic, because coherent and kept at an ironic distance; Tasso's often fail, because unnecessarily implausible and presented as true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"The palace must have a circumference of hundreds of miles, though it is built on a mountain peak; the base of the mountain must be thousands of miles around; the islet in the Canaries on which it rests must be the largest island in the world; which runs against the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, since all the Canaries are very small.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?" The realistic treatment of the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous in Arios­ to's style became a frequent and powerful literary technique with Galileo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His appreciation of tall tales told realistically would <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him to slide easily from the hypothetical and probable to the true and necessary, as in his eventual rendition of the Copernican system as something akin to revealed <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tancredi is not a coward but a Hamlet <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Was it his classicism or his conservatism that made him "deaf to the more modern in Tasso's pathetic treatments'?" The cause lies deeper: Galileo could not toler­ ate ambiguity in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> any more than in geometry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So, although he could praise Tasso occasionally for a well-turned phrase, as in his description of the façade of Armida's palace, and even for a good speech, as in Argante's retort to Tancredi at the com­ mencement of their final duel (I weep not for my fate but for Jerusalem's), he begins and ends his "Considerations" without a nuance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"?' Calileo's aversion to complexity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which is of a piece with his depreciation of history, is the obverse of his compulsive attention to linguistic  22 GALILEO details.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The avoidance produced his best work and some of his worst "<strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>s," just as it resulted in apt but also in excessive criti­ cism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Calileo's ducking of causal connections in physics and discomfort with depth of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in literature, and his reliance on mathematics in offense and defense, had the same psychological roots.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galileo's particular genius, his literalness, black-and-white judgments, hypochondria, and shallow psychological depth perception made a Manichean <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Going on the defense, he entices his opponent to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Ariosto, the true painter of the beauty of nature, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed Galileo in some way in reading the heavens and revealing the earth, for pictures in the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> contribute not a little to inform and direct the meditations of the philosopher.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>101 The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> on which the case turned was whether Ricasoli was in his right mind when he made his will late in 1589 in favor of a cousin to the exclusion of his sister.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Would it be right for a merchant to take advantage of a deranged gentleman? Following this line of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, the court elicited information that may explain how Galileo, who had no fortune or regular income, could afford to run with the Ricasolis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For much of his flight he had the company of his cousin, Giovanni Ricasoli, and of Galileo, who took <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to keep Ricasoli's relatives informed about their travels.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> That decided Galileo to try to place his troubled friend under medical <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Ricasoli accepted this charade, compounded of true concern, invention, and good humor, and put himself in the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of a doctor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"!" In alarm Galileo advised Ricasoli's uncle Lorenzo Giacomini that Ricasoli "needed very great and urgent <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who suffer much from melancholy humors can be supposed mad, since melancholy humors are among the sorts of infirmity that according to doctors attack the mind; and people who suffer from such humors cannot be deemed very reasonable for only those so qualify who in all their actions make perfect use of memory, speech, and <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We know from the great anatomist of melancholy, Galileo's younger contemporary Robert Burton, that the condition could produce a conviction of knowing the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and a missionary zeal to impose it on others; in its severest form it brought  A FLORENTINE EDUCATION 27 the megalomania that causes its sufferers to found religions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>':" Before he contracted this <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d form of melancholy around 1610, Galileo exhib­ ited only the mild melancholic symptoms of un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>, protectiveness, cir­ cumspection, ironic humor, and scholarly arrogance.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'!" Galileo's extravagant anger at any accusation of prevarication ("the greatest abomination") and his tendency to overkill challenges to his authority may have roots in these baseless attacks on his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>,'!'  2 A Tuscan Archimedes 2.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The Florentines threw back the charge of violating gravity and one of them made a model, to exact measure, to show the stability of the standard model, "for love of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact that Dante supplied this datum to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize a region reserved for Fraudsters should have been a warning to mathematicians who thought to exploit the information that the ninth ditch has a circumference of 22 miles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Greater <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong> can be obtained from the information that the torso of a giant is about 30 spans or 3 frieslanders or three times the height of the great bronze pinecone at St Peters; that a giant frozen waist deep set Dante and Virgil at the bottom of the well; and that Lucifer is of such a size that his arm is to a giant what a giant is to Dante.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the text in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, Aristotle taught that a body possessing absolute heaviness (earth) moves in a right line toward the center of the earth if nothing blocks the fulfill­ ment of its destiny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"!' In this typically clever argument, Galileo replaced physics by mathemat­ ics, scaling up his model without <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the strength of his material.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Mathematical argument pursued resolutely in its own right can preempt other <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, for example, prudence and forbearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>2 BARYCENTRIC EXERCISES Galileo launched his mathematical <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er on a few propositions in the Archimedean idiom and an instrument to implement the line of thought that Archimedes had started in the bathtub.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful (Galileo advised) when interpreting the results to note that the order reverses expectation: the distance of G to the silver mark F indicates the gold content, that from G to the gold mark Ethe silver.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>28 This result sets up the final proposition, which Galileo <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as his special "invention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Taking the known cent­ ers of gravity of the small and large cones (at A and B, <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively) and the unknown center of the frustum at X, he had AB:XB = ([B]-[A]):[A], where the bracketed quantities indicate the volumes of the two cones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Still, mathematics must be correct as well as <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed, and Clavius suspected that his new protégé had indeed commit­ ted the petitio of which he stood accused.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>':" Careful and responsible exegetes too easily can take as <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s of nature what are only accurate readings of texts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Take the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether air weighs (has a tendency downward) in air.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He took up several <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s harder even than these, for example, whether another earth would draw ours or vice versa, and how magnetism works.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" With these indications that Galileo had learned something from his former teacher, let us return to the perplexing <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether air weighs in air.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Buonamici obtained the same result in a similar experiment of greater <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To the uncomfortable <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, can a mathematical result that "troubles" philosophy kill a physical theory, Buonamici gave an unequivocal "no.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Mazzoni, who sends his <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For 700 scudi a year he was reworking his earlier contribution to the philosopher's equivalent of the argument over the relative excellence of Ariosto and Tasso: who is to be pre­ ferred, Plato or Aristotle? Mazzoni's first answer, published in 1576, was "nei­ ther and both"; rightly understood, the Titans of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> had to agree with one  A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES 47 another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Was Plato right in affirming that mathematics best described the constitution of matter, or Aristotle in placing quantity among the least important of nature's accidents? Did the philosopher come closer to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> by exploring the few mathematical ideas he found in his head or the vast range of experience presented by his senses? Mazzoni decided that Aristotle, otherwise reliable always or for the most part, had gone astray by neglecting the quantitative aspect of things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" There exist among Galileo's papers paraphrases of lectures on Aristotle's physics, particularly on <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s related to difficulties it raised for Chris­ tians, and on Aristotle's logic, particularly syllogistic and mathematical demonstrations, given originally at the Roman College, the central Jesuit university.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Many of the positions represented in Galileo's paraphrases came from St Thomas himself, including the resolution, in God's favor, of the awkward problem of establishing any certain <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> about the physical world in the teeth of His omnipotence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> In exchange for guidance in philosophy, Galileo could offer Mazzoni <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> in looking for decisive examples of the errors Aristotle had committed by depreciating mathematics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A brief visit to Buonamici's black hole will suggest how hope­ lessly twenty centuries of commentary had perplexed the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of free fall and projectile motion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In such cases, how does the "violence" of the initial mover survive in the mobile, and how does the original impulse lose its force?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As for  118 GALILEO data, Tycho had a castleful, collected by himself and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants or serfs in the first continuous systematic planetary observations ever undertaken.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Grave <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, these," said the professor, "and worthy of your minds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?" Galileo explained the meaning and relevance of parallax, reported that the nova displayed none, and concluded, as a <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>, that it lay beyond the moon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The menacing <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether a mere measurement could kill established physics again featured high on the philosophical agenda.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The several solutions suggested by friends and opponents of Galileo will indicate the <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>, alarm, and wishful thinking that the recent nova inspired among the commit­ ted learned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why knowledgeable people want to make the heavens corruptible in order to be able to pronounce the nova a star.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Noting that the nova first appeared near and during a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, he supposed it an offspring of their union, "a most <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> of the heavens, given as the last light in this last of the penultimate age of the world, to make us <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the contrivances and <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s of celestial nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Owing to its placement relative to Jupiter and Mercury, the star would expose the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, which is that the world is Tychonic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The authoritative Kepler denied that the nova owed anything to the grand conjunction, or Europe's problems anything to its fading, but to say the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> there was no reason to believe him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galileo's well-attended performances had trespassed beyond the disciplinary boundaries regulating public lectures and, with the authority of the podium, had planted doubt about the general <strong style='color: red'>reliability</strong> of the received world picture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Lorenzini did not pursue the argument at this level, however, but tried to discredit par­ allax measurements on technical grounds that he did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galileo guff<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d at Ruz­ zante's earthy humor and the rough expressive dialect of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and later kept his Florentine friends rollicking with his readings in Padovan.</li>

If they just stick to measuring, what do they <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> whether or not something can be created? If it was made of polenta, couldn't they still see it? Nonetheless, just like Galileo, Matteo speculates about the star's nature and settles on Calileo's theory as the best available.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> On this <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing he wrote most civilly to Galileo, whom he held in honor and affection, he said, and was most eager to serve.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> During his period of greatest <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> in the science of motion, from 1602 to 1609, he probably jumped from theory to experiment and from one idea to another, circled back and forth, inventing the form of a descriptive math­ ematical physics, guided often enough by little more than his buon gusto.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>55 For others, knowledge of the pathway to discovery, with its jumps forward, backward, and sideways, is of surpassing interest, both in its details and in its indications of the modes of human <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Guidobaldo del Monte's notebooks also contain <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s very close to ones Galileo later published as his own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some historians read these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s as records of conversations with Galileo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It is safer to attribute them to "Calileo's group," a set of friends with whom he discussed all sorts of things freely and openly, and to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> them, as the group seems to have done, as common property.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why did he reject the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s about motion as well as the answers given to them by Aristotle and his commentators, among whom we should number Galileo's former self, the author of "De motu antiquiora"? To obtain an answer in this muddle of uncertain dates, perplexed attri­ butions, and reciprocal influences without claiming greater <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> than our information allows, a Galileian dialogue, which permits digressions and approximations, might suit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is, I've been working hard to make ends meet and attend to three children and several clever friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is that I found serious difficulties in our dear old "De motu" and I have not been able to solve them within the old framework.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How does the moon influence the cause of the tides, the diurnal and annual motions of the earth?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He also faced up to the uncomfortable <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the diurnal motion alone could produce tides.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By showing that Ingoli's physical argu­ ments had no force, Galileo would demonstrate to heretics that the Holy Office had not condemned Copernicus from a mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the natural world.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" A quibble by Ingoli over heaviness and its natural place produced something more interesting: all the planets, including the sun, have heavy parts tending to their centers; the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> was, which center coincided with the center of the system.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sagredo: why have people not admitted the Pythagorean scheme that Simplicio almost drew spontaneously?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Something fishier than the dolphins of the title page appeared on its verso: three imprimaturs, one, undated, from Riccardi as Master of the Sacred Palace and the others, dated 11 September 1632, from Pietro Niccolini and Clemente Egidi, <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the Archbishop and Chief Inquisitor of Flor­ ence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The unusual procedure of a prelimi­ nary review indicated that the pope, as Niccolini reported on 5 September, then still <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed Galileo as a friend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>215 The problem of salvation and grace, which had brought the Jesuits and Dominicans into unresolvable conflict, involved the same sorts of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of divine and human freedom, or so Oreggi insinuated by inserting his report of the con­ versation between Barberini and Galileo in 1616 into a discussion of just  308 GALILEO these topics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to allow Galileo to talk with publishers, the report declared, Riccardi had given a provisional imprimatur for printing in Rome on the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing that he would review the sheets as they came from the press.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No more did the copies of his Letter to Christina, which he had sent to Riccardi, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> his case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That did not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Niccolini: perhaps the Copernican is the stronger side and Galileo could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> himself in seeming to prefer it? The Lord Cardinal: "[ Galileo] knew how to express exquisitely and to justify <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>­ fully whatever he wanted [to say].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Here the cardinal spoke the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>v? The celebrated <strong style='color: red'>clarity</strong> of Galileo's prose left him no hiding place.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>May God forgive Galileo and <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> his fellow plotter Ciampoli! "God is omnipotent and can do anything; but if He is omnipotent, why do we want to bind him?" Niccolini replied that, as far as he knew, that was Galileo's opinion too.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"However, [the pope] got upset and told me that one must not impose necessity on the blessed God; seeing that he was losing his temper, I did not want to continue discussing what I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"What Catholic ever conducted such a bitter dispute against heretics, even <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing a <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of faith, as Galileo does against those who maintain the earth's immobility?" Galileo had dismissed fixed-earth philosophers as less than human, ridiculous, small-minded, half-witted, idiotic, and praised Copernicans as superior intellects.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On 30 April, on the intervention of the commissary and the authority of Francesco Barberini, Galileo returned to Niccolini's to "recover from the discomforts and from his usual in<strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Every punishment has been mitigated out of <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for our master the Most Serene Grand Duke, and this is the real and only reason why all possible accommodations have been and will be made.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Maculano asked for authorization to deal "extrajudicially with Gali­ leo to make him <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> his error and, having recognized it, to bring him to confess it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If he were to maintain the fib with which the first interrogation ended, "it would become necessary to use greater rigor in the administration of justice and less <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for all the ramifications of this business.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'?" He felt in fine spirits, having had, he wrote Maria Celeste, "triumphant successes" owing to her prayers and the Niccolinis' <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Please also bear in mind (so Galileo ended his appeal to "the clemency and kindness of heart" of his judges) my <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age and pitiable state of health, and the constant "slanders of those who hate me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There was the sticky <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, however, what heresy Galileo may have held that had raised vehement suspicion in inquisitorial minds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sen­ tence recapitulates the case as written up in the summary report, to which it added that the Bellarmine certificate aggravated rather than ameliorated Gal­ ileo's situation since, "while it says that the said opinion is contrary to Holy Scripture, yet you dared to treat of it, defend it, and show it as probable; nor are you <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed by the license you artfully and cunningly extorted since you  VAINGLORY 317 did not mention the injunction you were under.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He wept like Job on any day he could not perform a s<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d rite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He left a prodigious quantity of manuscripts, including four volumes on the history of Poland written for his patron King Ladislav IV, and a number of essays uneasily combining Calileo's method of reaching <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>-sensible experience and necessary demonstration-with Urban's teaching that the only accessible <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> lies in revelation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In pursu­ ing his new physics, Ciampoli had the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of a student of Castelli's, who served as his secretary for several years between 1637 and 1641.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Was Copernicanism a heresy or not? Did the proscription against teaching it apply only to Gali­ leo? The un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> suggests a difference of opinion among Galileo's judges over the nature and severity of his crime.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Some of the nuncios did their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> zealously, others more languidly, but none could say for certain what the documents, which, as handwritten copies, differed somewhat among themselves, signified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The nuncio to Venice allowed himself to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize both Galilee's views and those of Holy Writ as opinions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"26 Mathematicians within the reach of Rome censored themselves and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized the Copernican system as a hypothesis or supposition if they discussed it at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The Holy Office maintained its clampdown on Galileo, which included monitoring his visitors, because Urban continued to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> him as a clear and present danger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He spent the time in Brescia, sent there, some say, by a caring pope, to keep him from acting rashly, or, others say, drawn there to liberate his brother from jail with the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of the sympathetic cardinal nephew.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Instead, Castelli received the largely pro-forma charge of a Benedictine abbey in the Veneto to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him meet his expenses in Rome, which included outlays for good wine and the tobacco he recommended to Galileo as a cure for everything.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Castelli's ongoing <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> as "mathematician to Pope Urban VIII and pro­ fessor at the University of Rome" dealt with such enduring problems as controlling the River Reno and draining the Pontine Marshes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Castelli, Guiducci, and other Galileists famil­ iar with Galileo's unpublished ideas about motion on inclined planes argued that the cut would not <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the flow because change in elevation, not length of channel, determined change in velocity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Piccolomini did well from his <strong style='color: red'>collaboration</strong> with fate and ended the Thirty Years War in command of the imperial forces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" But experience had exposed its shortcomings (his calculation of Virginia's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> suited Livia's better, and vice versa), the Morandi affair its dangers, and the Bull Inscrutabilis its illegality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>�9 Despite the silk hangings and rieh furnishings of his apartment, Galileo longed to return to Florence and, as he fancied, the grand duke's <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> He urged Cioli to ask Ferdinando II to ask the pope for his release, "and, to give the petition more force, he might adduce the loss of my <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s over so long a time, exaggerating their value somewhat over their true worth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Galileo had therefore to continue to operate in Flor­ ence at a distance, primarily through Maria Celeste, who with the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of Guiducci and Bocchineri had attended to Calileo's business during his con­ finement in Rome.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Maria Celeste: "I pray that you continue [in good health] by governing yourself well particularly with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the drinking that is so hurtful to you, for I fear that .</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> She persuaded him to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> enlarge her brother Vincenzo's house in Costa San Giorgio between Florence and Arcetri, which would be a refuge for him when ill; she succored the ingrate Vincenzo Landucci, left in a pitiable state with two children when the plague took his wife; and she urged Galileo to other good works, like <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing the relatives of his mother.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Perhaps Galileo took the many <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s his daughter rendered too much for granted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Micanzio expressed his admiration in the style of a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in a Galilean dialogue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" "I cannot admire enough how the book of nature is so fully open to your mind that you find the most profound and undetected <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>s in everything.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In reading all my works, no one will find even the smallest shadow of anything straying from piety and <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> toward the Holy Church.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Perhaps a strict interpreter might spy a lapse of piety or zeal in Galileo's <strong style='color: red'>collaboration</strong> in the publication of the Letter to Christina, since he sup­ plied the manuscript and also commented on Diodati's draft preface.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He therefore proposed to acquire a press to print Calileo's work, "which is equally beautiful and novel, as <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous as it is certain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The narrow arena defined by Florence and Rome, in which he had tried universal <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s against parochial interests, now appeared in its true measure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Regarded from Paris, Noailles wrote, "you are the greatest mind in Italy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The discussion opens with a complaint by Sagredo: despite his best efforts, he has not been able to make workmen <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> that if a wooden beam of given length and cross-section can support a weight w, a similar beam with dimensions increased ten-fold should be able to support a weight lOW.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What about stone or metal? Salviati remarks that two flat, highly polished pieces of marble will adhere when their smooth surfaces are pressed together, and asks whether nature's reluctance to admit a void (the cause offered for the adherence of the marbles) can explain the coherence of bodies? To settle the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, Salviati adduces Galileo's dem­ onstration that water has no force of aggregation among its parts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A rolling wheel <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s along the ground a dis­ tance equal to its circumference during each rotation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Fra Paolo had not identi­ fied the "alien" in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Salviati turned to exploding Aristotle's theory of the void with the arguments Galileo had developed by 1610: velocity of fall independent of weight, Archimedean buoyancy, descent along inclined planes, and pendu­ lum swings strictly isochronous ir<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive of amplitude.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Still, it had been worthwhile to hear Salviati's "delicate and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful," "subtle .</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> Simplicio breaks in to declare a preference for the arithmetic formulation (the odd-number rule), which he fully <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s, over Galileo's geometrical one (areas of triangles), which gives him trouble; and he demands some experi­ mental evidence to anchor the theory before the reading continues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> The problem under <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> concerns planes of finite slope.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although a shot at pointblank would, on Galileo's physics, continue its "horizontal" motion in a circle concentric with the earth, he treats it as linear because the distances under <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> are small relative to the earth's cir­ cumference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> appreciate their nature, a sketch of a simpler account, conceptually available to Galileo, will be <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> As a reward for slogging through these demonstrations, Salviati offered his friends a little "<strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> and delight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[This] excited in the minds of those who only wanted to be <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed learned such disdain that, as they are very clever and powerful, they managed to suppress what I had found and published and to block the publication of what remains to me to bring to light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When Noailles undertook to persuade the pope that Galileo had not intended a slight by allowing Simplicio to describe Urban's medicine, Urban replied, "we know it, we know it," but added, as Galileo relayed the report to Micanzio, "reading my Dialogue was most pernicious to Christianity,"?' Urban carried his pastoral <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in this matter to the extraordinary degree of reserving to himself the authority to grant exemptions to read the Dia­ logue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They resumed briefly around 1630, when Galileo had the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of Ippolito Francini, an accomplished lens maker employed in the Medici glass factory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He willingly ran it, however, trusting in Hortensius's discretion, <strong style='color: red'>honesty</strong>, and acuteness of mind: "Since you are very intelligent, I am certain that you will know that there is no other method available to determine longitude than the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful properties of the stars around Iupiter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>':" He appealed to Galileo for theoretical under­ pinnings (the parameters of the satellites' orbits) and instrumental <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> (telescope lenses).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As for the lenses, he would try to engage Francini, and, as a stopgap, would send the best lenses that had ever been constructed, the telescope "with which I have discovered all the celestial <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>s.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Now what will your Reverence say when you compare these three lunar periods with the diurnal, monthly, and annual motions of the sea, over which everyone agrees the moon is the arbiter and overseer?" These guesses perplexed Micanzio if he remem­ bered that in the Dialogue Salviati had already pointed out the daily period of lunar "libration" and referred it, correctly, to parallax: an earth-bound observer looks at slightly different limbs of the moon when it rises and sets, and only if and when it crossed his zenith could he see exactly what the ideal astronomer placed at the earth's center would see.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'!' "The sky, the world, and the universe that my <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ous observations and clear demonstrations enlarged a hundred or a thousand times beyond what all the sages of all the ages before me had seen, are now diminished and restricted for me to no more than the space my person occupies.</li>
