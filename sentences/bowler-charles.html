<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How somebody earned a living, made a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er and got on with family and friends is an essential part of a biography - though in this series it is the subjects’ commitment to science that has got them in, and must always be at the back of the biographer’s mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What was original was that he made the idea scientifically <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able by proposing the mechanism of natural selection - not in his case as the only mechanism for evolution, for he allowed what we would call ‘Lamarckian’ factors a role also, but as the chief mechanism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if we stop to think about it, we find that commitment to a great idea, with a determination to test and refine it, is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of great scientists but not of us ordinary busy people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If I am not an expert on Darwin himself, I have at least devoted a significant fraction of my life to trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the impact of his theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Darwin industry itself has overturned many of the myths surrounding his work, but there is another line of research that has — xi — Preface also <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to throw a different light on the impact of evolutionism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This book uses a survey of his life and work as a vehicle for encouraging the reader to think more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully about how we should interpret a man whose ideas have been used and misused in so many different ways, both inside and outside science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How, then, do we approach the life of a man whose work still arouses such strong and contradictory feelings? It is clearly impossible to launch directly into a minute study of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin has become an almost mythological figure in the emergence of modern culture, his achieve- The Problem of Interpretation ments overlaid with layers of interpretation and misinterpretation designed to influence our <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> of what he did.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For liberals his theory underpinned an optimistic philosophy of progress, providing a conceptual guarantee that things would continue to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> if only nature and society were left to develop on their own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many scientists believe Plate i Darwin as a public figure: caricature from the periodical Vanity Pair, September 30th, 1871 The Problem of Interpretation that his theory of evolution by natural selection has been triumphantly vindicated, providing the basis for the modern attempt to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the development of life on earth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet even within the ranks of professional biologists there are a few who think that Darwin’s ideas were misguided and will have to be modified or even abandoned if science is to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> much further.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>2 Even from the perspective of a specialized historian of science, evaluation of Darwin’s achievements thus requires a value <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> to be made from the very beginning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The resulting debates reveal that even today most ordinary people still do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the basic principles upon which Darwin’s theory is based.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They fear that we shall lose <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for our <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> and for our status as moral beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When conservatives argue that the existing state of society is ‘natural’ because it reflects our biological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, socialists invoke the memory of Darwin and the ‘struggle for existence’ to show that even science itself can be shaped by its political environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>5 De Beer was a biologist who pioneered the discovery and publication of Darwin’s papers, and most historians <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> his efforts as a biographer even though they are aware of his limitations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Inevitably, this entails a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful assessment of how the subject interacted with his or her social and cultural environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What incidents sparked off the train of creative thought, and how was the new idea presented to the world at large? In the case of Darwin, the private papers now available <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to fill in many of the gaps that are missing in his own autobiography and in contemporary accounts of his work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can see precisely how his thoughts flitted backwards and forwards as he tried to assess the various strands of evidence that he thought would bear on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the origin of species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can see how his family life <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to support him and how his wife to some extent served as a sounding board by which he judged the public acceptability of his ideas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the popular <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, scientists are people who make an objective study of nature and come up with factual information that forms a permanent contribution to human knowledge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Unlike the artist, the scientist produces something whose value is un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>able - it cannot for instance rise and fall in popularity according to changing cultural fashions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some would say that the scientist is not creative in the same sense as the artist: he merely looks <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully at nature and records accurately what he sees, imposing no interpretation of his own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although scientific hypotheses must be tested by observation and experiment, it is obvious that all the great scientific theories arose from major leaps of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, from new ideas about how nature might work, which were only subsequently shown to have some factual validity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The availability of the Darwin papers allows psychologists to treat his discovery of natural selection as an important test-case for our <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of creative thinking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>9 They do not want to concede that all science is influenced by ideology but they must invoke the social factor to explain why bad science can sometimes gain a hold on the public <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> someone like Darwin we must be prepared to transcend all these simple black and white alternatives.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what, in the end, was the impact of Darwin’s theory upon Victorian science and thought - and what is its legacy to the modern world? When we move on to consider this wider <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we are forced once again to grapple with issues whose resolution depends on our The Problem of Interpretation attitudes towards the theory itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was writing before the start of the controversies over the adequacy of the Modern Synthesis which have led some biologists to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> the adequacy of the selection theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin’s theory laid the foundations for current thinking on the subject, although later biologists had, of course, found it necessary to make some <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments, especially to Darwin’s rather primitive ideas on heredity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are thus — 10 — The Problem of Interpretation dismissed as side branches leading away from the main line, which is firmly Darwinian in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cultural historians such as Jacques Barzun and Gertrude Himmelfarb blame the Origin of Species for ushering in an age of materialism and the <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of brute force, thus paving the way for the horrors of the twentieth century.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The claim that the ‘Darwinian Revolution’ in science <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to precipitate a major cultural transition also seems to reinforce the view that Darwin merely reflected the ideology of his time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It hardly seems to matter whether you love Darwin’s message or hate it; you cannot escape the fact that it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to overturn the traditional Christian world view.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even the great social Darwinists either ignored or misrepresented what we now <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as the most important aspects of Darwin’s thought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Far from constituting the main line of development in nineteenth-century evolutionism, Darwin’s theory was in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s an anomaly that his contemporaries were unable to come to grips with.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Given the widespread popular mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of Darwinism, it is important for us to be clear about the revolutionary nature of Darwin’s proposals as they are understood by modern biologists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These ‘fitter’ (that is, better adapted) individuals survive and breed more readily than the others and their advantageous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> thus increases in frequency in the next generation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Over a long period the adaptive feature spreads through the whole population and the average <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the species changes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin and the modern Darwinians assume that small changes produced in this way will eventually add up to give the major developments that have <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized the appearance of new forms of life in the course of the earth’s history.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the later nineteenth century many ‘Darwinists’ paid lip <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the idea of natural selection, but they preferred to believe that evolution was, after all, guided inexorably in the direction of progress towards mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only after the modern concept of genetic mutation confirmed that individual variation is essentially random were biologists forced to come to grips with the prospect that evolution might have the open-ended <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> predicted by Darwin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this is so, then the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how Darwin interacted with his contemporaries becomes absolutely crucial.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Once we realize that the selection theory did not carry all before it when first published, we need to ask a series of entirely new <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s about the way in which Darwin interacted with his contemporaries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To what extent had nineteenth-century science and culture begun to move towards an evolutionary viewpoint before the Origin of Species appeared? Why had that movement become blocked so that a book containing an unacceptably radical idea was able to act as the catalyst that precipitated the transition? To what extent did Darwin’s skill at presenting his theory to a scientific and a general audience rest upon his willingness to adapt his language and metaphors to the prevailing values of the time? Why did Darwin’s name become a symbol for progressionist evolutionism if modern biologists <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> his theory as undermining the whole logic of progressionism? To answer these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s we need to get away from the old stereotypes in which Darwin succeeded either because he got the right answer or because he got the wrong answer that everyone preferred to hear about.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A meaningful life of Darwin must try to answer the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s outlined above.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin is an unusual figure in the history of science because he was hailed as a hero in his own lifetime, yet not for those achievements for The Problem of Interpretation which he is most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed today.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must constantly balance the need to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the discoveries <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed by the modern biologist against the historian’s desire to uncover the complex role played by ‘Darwinism’ in the development of nineteenth-century thought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1879 the novelist Samuel Butler, who had conceived a violent distaste for the theory of natural selection, published his Evolution, Old and New to argue that Darwin was by no means the first to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> a theory of evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of these developments were not directly related to the idea of evolution, but <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to pave the way for the developmental view of nature that Darwin would have to interact with.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the development and presentation of Darwin’s theory without reference to these earlier debates can only lead to mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing and oversimplification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They appealed to transmutationism to support the claim that humans are nothing more than highly developed animals, thus undermining the belief that we have a soul capable of appreciating divinely revealed <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s, a belief which always seemed to imply that one should support the existing social hierarchy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In addition, Lamarck held that the simplest forms of life <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d gradually but inevitably along a scale or hierarchy of complexity, until at length the human race was formed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For later biologists, however, Lamarck’s name has become associated more closely with what was actually only a minor part of his theory, the mechanism of the ‘inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics’.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the later nineteenth century some of Darwin’s opponents began to call themselves ‘Lamarckians’, but by this time the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s had been dissociated from the rest of Lamarck’s views and from the materialist label attached to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Modern genetics suggests that, in fact, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s acquired by an adult’s efforts cannot be transmitted to its children.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the beginning of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er Grant was seen as a future leader in his field and his radical opinions were widely circulated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Phrenology was eventually discredited as a pseudo-science because it assumed that a person’s <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> could be read from the bumps on his or her head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although not a Lamarckian in the sense that he accepted the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics, Chambers nevertheless retained the linear progressionism that Grant had associated with the theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>However, for Chambers, the link between evolution and embryology was a fundamental clue to the progressive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of all natural development.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Powell was openly linking this view to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the development of life on earth, and we can see his position as an anticipation of one of the most common reactions to the Origin of Species: acceptance of evolution provided that the mechanism of change retains the element of teleology denied by Darwin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was more concerned with the Evolution before the Origin of Species individual’s positive response to an environmental challenge, and from the first he suspected that such responses could be inherited and thus be incorporated into the species’ biological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In an essay in 1851 on ‘The Development Hypothesis’ Spencer proclaimed his support for Lamarck’s mechanism of the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even some conservative scientists had become aware of the need to postulate some sort of developmental process in nature, but they were forced to tread <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully because any suggestion that mankind was merely a highly developed ape raised theological problems that few were as yet willing to face.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But here too the way forward was blocked, because the blacklisting of Lamarckism meant that there was no <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able mechanism of evolution upon which to build the revolution in science that would be the first step toward imposing a progressionist world view upon Victorian culture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In these circumstances, a new initiative by a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed naturalist was bound to have major repercussions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The French biologist Georges Cuvier made <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful studies of many fossilized creatures and showed that they were unlike any species now alive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of the leading exponents of this view was the Reader in Geology at Oxford, William Buckland, whose popular lectures <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to generate wide interest in the fossil record.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact he was extremely active in the movement that <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to create the outline of the earth’s history that we still accept today.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In particular, they outlined the progressive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the fossil record, which seemed to begin with primitive invertebrates and then move on successively to the ages dominated by fish, reptiles and finally mammals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Adrian Desmond has shown how Owen’s concept of the dinosaur was part of his campaign against Grant: the dinosaurs were the most <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d reptiles, yet they were among the earliest members of their class.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is only Darwin’s modern followers who have been able to come to grips properly with the implications of a theory in which evolution has no preordained goal towards which it must be supposed to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This makes any assessment of his early <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er doubly problematic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before outlining the early stages of Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, it is thus import- The Young Darwin ant for us to be clear about the kind of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s we need to ask if we are to gain a full appreciation of his actions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To what extent did the radical intellectual background of the Darwin family (clearly illustrated by the opinions of Erasmus Darwin) predispose him to challenge the orthodox view of nature? How did this radical background interact with the more conventional education he received at Cambridge? How did the young Darwin gain <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> as a promising naturalist who could begin to speak on equal terms with the great names in the field? How did he set about gathering information on a topic that was likely to arouse strong opinions in almost anyone who knew what he was driving at? To what extent did his awareness of transmutationism’s radical implications shape his quest for ideas and information that would be relevant to his project? Once the theory had begun to emerge, did he find it necessary to modify his views in order to accommodate either scientific or popular prejudices? These are just a few of the topics which need to be addressed in addition to the conventional story of Darwin’s voyage on the Beagle and his investigation of animal breeding.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The historian seeking to evaluate Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er is now confronted with an almost overwhelming wealth of sources.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This was first published (with some sensitive passages on religious <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s omitted) in the Life and Letters collected shortly after his death by his son Francis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have already noted that the autobiography itself was at first edited to remove some of Darwin’s thoughts on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of religion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What follows is an account of Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er that tries to mediate between the need to reveal the scientific foundations of his theory and the necessity of including the insights generated by the latest scholarship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Modern interpretations reveal the extent to which Darwin was absorbed in the scientific thinking of his time, as well as the extent to which he transcended that thinking to produce a radical new approach to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the origin of species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the Darwins belonged to the more radical element of the liberal or Whig tradition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic family attitudes can be seen in the writings and activities of Erasmus Darwin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Charles had a deep <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for his father, who survived until 1848.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was also a good judge of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and a good businessman, amassing a fortune that allowed him to provide his children with an independent income when they grew up.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A recent study by Sylvan Schweber suggests that Darwin’s chemistry may have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to shape his view of the nature of living things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To some extent, Darwin’s later theorizing can be seen as an attempt to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how these living structures interact with their environment in a law-bound manner over long periods of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He also began to interact with Robert Grant, then <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as one of the country’s most promising young naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a detailed study of the Edinburgh period, Phillip Sloan has suggested that Darwin was already becoming an active naturalist with theoretical opinions and that interests aroused at Edinburgh were to remain important through into later episodes of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Instead, they argue that certain themes and interests continued throughout his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, sometimes falling into the background only to be revived again later on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>— 40 — The Young Darwin Sloan argues that this later development was an important prelude to his adoption of transformist views, and points out that he was to retain a lifelong interest in the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of reproduction sparked off by this early research.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A more active disgust was engendered by some unpleasant experiences in the operating theatre, and before long Darwin was becoming convinced that he was not cut out for a medical <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At this time the clergy offered one of the few openings for those seeking a ‘<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able’ profession, apart from medicine and the law, and many clergymen were amateur naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As he later wrote: ‘as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted’.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Cambridge Darwin encountered a very different atmosphere from that prevailing in Edinburgh, an atmosphere designed to reinforce, if only temporarily, the more conservative side of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, however, Cambridge was much less a bastion of High Church Toryism than Oxford.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By working hard at his classics and divinity he managed eventually to gain a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able degree; among the ‘men who did not go in for honours’ he was tenth in the list of January 1831.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was Fox who introduced Darwin to Henslow, thus beginning a friendship which he was later to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as one of the most influential of his whole life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must get away from the image of Darwin as the relatively untrained novice who set out on his voyage around the world with little or no <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the theoretical issues underlying natural history.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>— 44 — The Young Darwin After taking his examinations Darwin had to spend two further terms in residence at Cambridge and it was at this point in his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er that he extended his interests to include geology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>23 Robert Darwin was concerned that the voyage would reflect badly on his son’s <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, especially if he eventually attempted to take up a position in the Church.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wedgwood responded that natural history was a perfectly <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able occupation for a clergyman but hinted that Charles’s commitment to his studies opened up an alternative lifestyle for which the Beagle voyage would be a perfect preparation: ‘His present pursuit of knowledge is in the same track as he would have to follow in the expedition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having met Darwin, Fitzroy decided that the shape of his nose did not indicate sufficient firmness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> (he was a follower of the ‘science’ of physiognomy, according to which <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> was reflected in the facial features).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>— 47 — 4 Ohe Voyage of the “Beagle The voyage of the Beagle is often presented as a watershed in Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, an experience which effectively converted him to evolutionism and thus shaped all his later thinking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin himself encouraged this view when he wrote in the Autobiography ‘The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important event in my life, and has determined my whole <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>2 The scholars of the ‘Darwin industry’ have been forced to battle against the mythological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> acquired by the voyage in order to reconstruct the true story.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we want to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what Darwin was actually doing while circumnavigating the globe, we must look to the notebooks and letters written at the time — which reflect a very different set of interests to those imposed by hindsight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After 1834 he began to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> theories on geological dynamics and he knew that he would be returning with exciting evidence that would influence theoretical debates in England.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here the only inhabitants were sea birds and the parasitic insects they hosted, a fact which gave Darwin food for thought on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how newly formed islands became populated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>13 Fitzroy would later adopt a fundamentalist position on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the Genesis story of creation, but at this point he was far more flexible in his beliefs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their close relationship <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to establish the possibility that one might have been derived from the other by transmutation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But Darwin was also led to ponder the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of what determined the distribution of two such closely related forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Noting that the rodent Toxodon also seemed to have affinities to the pachyderms, he observes: ‘How <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully are the different Orders, at the present time so well separated, blended together in different points of the structure of the Toxodon!’15 This was exactly the kind of relationship that convinced Darwin of the need to see evolution as a branching tree rather than a ladder of progress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The hint that such a relationship might imply transmutation can easily be read into Darwin’s words by anyone familiar with his later theory: ‘This <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He also allowed himself some caustic comments on the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments that would have been made had the colonists been of British rather than Spanish origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin was particularly attracted by one who had been named Jemmy Button, a lively <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> who was now most particular about the state of his dress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>‘It seems yet <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>24 To a large extent, Darwin’s later theorizing would be stimulated by his efforts to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the implications of geological uniform-itarianism for the geographical distribution of living species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He also noted the marine iguanas, diving off the black rocks into the sea where they fed on se<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>ed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>26 There was no ‘eureka’ experience on the Galapagos and Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of their significance developed only slowly over the next few years.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not surprisingly he was soon on good terms with Lyell, whom he praised for his clear-mindedness and his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the work of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin confessed that he was unable to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> Owen’s <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> and other friends warned him that Owen was a difficult man to get along with (in subsequent years he became a bitter opponent of the selection theory, although not of evolutionism in general).</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Much ink has been spilled over the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of Darwin’s illness and a variety of retrospective diagnoses have been offered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These attacks could well have become more intense after he began to realize that his views on the species <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> would bring him into conflict with public opinion and, more directly, with his wife’s religious feelings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A fine modern edition has now made this unique record of scientific <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> available to scholars everywhere (references to the Notebooks below are to the original pagination, clearly indicated in this edition).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor did Darwin conceal the fact that he was becoming interested in the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of evolutionism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin read systematically in the areas of biology that he thought might bear on his research and in works on psychology, political economy and other topics that would throw light on the origins of human <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics (see the list of books at the end of the B Notebook).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1839 he issued a printed list of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s to be answered by breeders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of Darwin’s originality - or lack of it - has long exercised the minds of historians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is one thing to imagine a species being ‘purified’ through the wiping out of deviant individuals, quite another to see that the selection of random variations might actually change the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet, as Frank Sulloway points out, no one else <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed the Galapagos species as proof of evolution, not even Gould himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>26 His views in this area were distinctly pre-genetical in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and they remained an integral part of his thinking throughout the rest of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is important to note that Darwin’s early thinking - including his original formulations of the selection theory — was distinctly teleological in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, though, Darwin was already making a radical break with contemporary thinking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of the most important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of Darwin’s approach is — 79 — The Crucial Years: London, 1837-1842 \J ft- ft ^S^ez^.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Knowledge of the process of adaptive evolution <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s us to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the relationships between living forms and throws some light on the fossil record.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the process is irregular and unpredictable because we can never hope to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> all the possibilities for migration that may open up for a species in the course of its history.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The unique nature of Darwin’s approach was that it offered an <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of historical processes in terms of observable causes without requiring him to attempt the impossible task of describing the whole history of life on earth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Evolution <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s us to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the nature of life on earth through its past - but only in the sense that it illuminates the general processes that have given rise to the particular living species we see today.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was inclined to think that there would be less variation in nature because he saw changed conditions as the factor that would stimulate the production of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Given the ever-present struggle for existence, those individuals who exhibit a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that is adapted to the new conditions will have a better chance of surviving and of transmitting their peculiarity to future generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The natural process of selection is thus analogous to artificial selection but far more effective because it scrutinizes every minute <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of every individual in every generation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He may also have been impressed by the quasi-numerical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Malthus’ demonstration, which fitted in with his search for testable laws.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His system also included an element of inevitable progress that Darwin found impossible to square with his <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the irregular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of biological evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even his private notes reveal how <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful he saw he must be on such topics: ‘To avoid stating how far, I believe, in Materialism, say only that emotions, instincts degrees of talent, which are hereditary are so because brain of child resemble, parent stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many now accept that, despite his <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of the materialist implications of selectionism for human nature, he continued for some time to believe that the natural world was created by a rational God.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact is that, as a biologist, he found himself <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ing assumptions which - as a Victorian Englishman - he found it difficult to shake off.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the human race was the high point of creation, it had reached its pinnacle via a very irregular course which could never have been predicted in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever the creative uses to which Darwin put his doubts about religion and the purpose of evolution, it seems clear that here was the source of the emotional tensions which may have begun to exaggerate his pre<strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> to stomach upsets and heart palpitations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Far from seeing Darwin as a recluse, modern historians <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> at the skill with which he built up a network of communication that would serve his purposes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He also hoped to create a small body of influential scientists who might eventually <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to introduce the theory to a hostile world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin’s monographs on the living and fossil barnacles <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to establish his credentials as a biologist but the work also allowed him to study the variability of populations and the implications of evolutionism for classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin did fear the loss of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ability, but we now know that his refusal to publish stemmed at least in part from a <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> that the theory was not yet complete.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although committed to the metaphor of evolution as a branching tree, he did not yet <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the branches of the tree constantly tended to diverge further and further away from one another.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The penny post <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, introduced in 1840, was very efficient, allowing him to interact with many individuals and institutions at arm’s length.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>10 This Essay is of considerable interest to historians because it gives a detailed outline of how the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of evolution stood in Darwin’s mind at this early stage in his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s his exposition already looks forward to the Origin of Species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the 1844 Essay anticipates much that would appear in the Origin of Species, historians now accept that in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it expresses only an immature version of the theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At this point in his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, Darwin had not realized that the pressure of population would maintain the struggle for existence even in a stable environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He found that in order to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the relationship between this specimen and the rest of the subclass he had to dissect and study members of other species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two volumes of his Monograph on the Sub-Class Cirripedia (1851-4) and the corresponding two volumes of the fossil barnacles are still <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the foundation stone for our modern <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In response to what he took as an implied criticism from Hooker, he wrote ‘How painfully (to me) true is your remark that no one has hardly a right to examine the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of species who has not minutely described many.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>17 He was trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the various forms of barnacles could have been formed by a process such as natural selection in which every stage of development must have been of some use at the time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Natural selection cannot plan ahead; it can only favour those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s that confer an advantage in the current situation, and this imposes limitations that are difficult for anyone wedded to a more teleological view of evolution to appreciate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This in turn highlighted the problem of divergence: why had natural selection acted to produce such a high level of diversity within many groups? By 1847 it is clear that Darwin recognized the deficiency of the 1844 Essay on this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, a <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> that would be reinforced by the palaeontological — io3 — The Years of Development work of Owen and others over the next few years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As David Kohn has shown, this study was based on a form of historical reasoning which is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Darwin’s whole approach to evolution and which sets it apart from the thinking of the vast majority of his contemporaries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even in the late 1830s he had abandoned any notion of a God who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully superintends the process of evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was not yet an atheist, though, since he still <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed evolution by natural selection as the kind of process that might have been instituted by a benevolent God to ensure that His creatures can maintain themselves in a world subject to geological change.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Autobiography records that he was still a theist when he wrote the Origin of Species A A theist believes in a God who not only created but also <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s for and sustains the world - as opposed to a deist who believes merely in a remote and uncaring Creator.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet throughout the rest of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er he would find himself plagued with doubts about the possibility of any meaningful relationship between the Creator and the individual events that take place in the world of living things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Apart from his own slowly ebbing preference for a theistic view of nature, Darwin realized that he must be very <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to minimize the materialistic aspects of his theory in any public pronouncement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The metaphor of the superintending Being was merely a device that would <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> those with theistic beliefs to come to grips with the idea.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The metaphor does not appear in the Origin of Species - yet, as Robert Young has pointed out, the very term ‘natural selection1 <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to encourage the view that nature was, after all, an intelligent agent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difficulty of comparing forms with entirely different fundamental structures led him to <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> whether the very concept of one organism being ‘higher’ than another could be translated into meaningful biological terms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The crucial <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is: did Darwin himself - and his followers after 1859 - fully appreciate this aspect of the theory? In fact Darwin always found it difficult to stand by the most radical implications of divergent evolutionism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two naturalists approached the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> from different angles and differed on important points throughout their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s an unlikely detonator for the cultural explosion that it is supposed to have set off and some modern readers may <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> what all the fuss is about.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As scientific books go it is reasonably accessible to the non-specialist, but one sometimes <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s how many modern readers are able to follow the whole logic of the argument that Darwin develops amidst all the details.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He began his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as a land surveyor and then became a schoolteacher in Leicester.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin read the paper and was interested to note that it used the metaphor of a branching tree of relationships, but he saw no evidence that Wallace had anything to offer on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of an evolutionary mechanism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The paper did have an impact on Charles Lyell’s thinking on the species <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, however, and may have been responsible for Lyell’s recommendation that Darwin — hi — Going Public should write up his theory for publication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Meanwhile Wallace continued to think about the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, and in 1858 the solution came to him while he was suffering from a bout of fever on the island of Gilolo (not, as he later claimed, on the better-known spice island of Ternate).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Careful reading of Wallace’s paper reveals that in several important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s his theory failed to duplicate the essence of Darwin’s thinking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His mechanism did not even address the basic <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how selection acts on individual differences to change a population, because he was interested in how one well-marked variety (what we now call a subspecies) could replace others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace never admitted that his 1858 paper was not a complete expression of the Darwinian theory and in later reprintings he added subtitles that <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to blur the distinctions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Far from being rivals, the two men always treated each other with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> and, later on, with affection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ‘Introduction’ leads the reader directly to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of adaptation which Darwin sees as the central problem of evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He argues briefly that Lamarckism cannot explain all cases of adaptation and points out that the simple progressionism of the 'Vestiges does not even address the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how species become adapted to their environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin was convinced that the analogy with artificial selection was the best way of <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing his readers to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how nature might be able to produce similar changes by an equivalent selective process.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He points out that natural selection acts only to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the organisms’ ability to cope with their environment and thus tries to persuade his readers that, whatever the apparent harshness of natural selection, we can nevertheless see it as a force promoting the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of living things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Reproduction rather than survival is the crucial factor of course, a point illustrated in the section on ‘Sexual selection’ in which Darwin argues that any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> useful in obtaining a mate will become highly developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The antlers of deer and the bright colours of many birds are explained by the fact that the mating habits of the various species allow those males with well-developed secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to attract more females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If natural selection works only by seizing upon advantageous variations, then surely all <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s must be adaptive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet many naturalists were convinced that species possess useless <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was convinced that natural selection can act on instincts just as it can act on physical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Palaeontologists were generally agreed that in any sequence of fossil formations the intermediate forms in time were intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the pigs and camels could now be united into a single group by including fossils which were intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other we have Darwin as the public symbol of the controversial new theory of evolution, the figurehead of the movement by which science was seeking to take control of areas of thought once <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the province of theologians and moralists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact that Darwin himself was not altogether converted to what most people at the time would have meant by ‘Darwinism’ can be seen from the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his later research.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These were not idle or insignificant projects; each <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed evolutionism to throw light on what Darwin knew to be a significant problem in natural history.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cultivating his Garden In many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s life in the Darwin household was unaffected by the publication of the Origin of Species.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He welcomed natural selection not - as we shall see below - because he was convinced that it held all the answers, but because it showed that new ideas on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> were still possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>8 Throughout the rest of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er Huxley would be tempted by the view that new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s might appear suddenly in response to some power directing the course of variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>13 Evolutionism was now secure, although natural selection was still widely <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as only a part of the overall mechanism of change.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pangenesis supposed that each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the offspring was built from a number of gemmules derived from the appropriate part of both parents’ bodies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus it implied that heredity was a process in which parental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were blended together, not transmitted as unchangeable units as Mendel was to demonstrate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>16 As the engineer Fleeming Jenkin pointed out in an 1867 review of the Origin of Species a favourable new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would be swamped by blending because its effect would be halved in each successive generation due to interbreeding with unchanged individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Eiseley suggests that selection could only be seen as an effective mechanism if it were supposed that the favourable new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was inherited as a unit and was thus immune to dilution in this way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pangenesis allowed for the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics because the parents’ bodies actually manufacture their gemmules rather than merely transmitting unit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as in the modern concept of the gene.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jenkin had been thinking of single individuals with significantly new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s - monstrosities or ‘sports of nature’.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some time before Jenkin’s review appeared, Wallace was urging him to insist that for most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s there is a range of variation already existing within the population.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although he never called himself a botanist, — 134 — The Emergence of Darwinism many of these later projects involved studies of plant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics that were intended to show how evolution could have produced them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Francis Darwin, who became his father’s <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant in this long series of experiments, recalled how he would persevere despite the considerable difficulties - counting plant seeds by simple microscope, for instance, in extensive breeding trials.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>20 Darwin also showed that these complex mechanisms could have been produced by natural selection because there are usually other species with less well-developed forms of the complex <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> illustrating the route that evolution might have taken.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From that chance observation flowed eleven years of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful experiments intended to demonstrate the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this assumption, culminating in his book The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization in the Vegetable Kingdom (1876).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>24 But Darwin knew that in most cases the fossil evidence to decide such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s would — 137 — The Emergence of Darwinism be lacking and he chose not to comment in public on the major steps in the ascent of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Where many ‘Darwinians’ saw the reconstruction of the history of life on earth as their major goal, Darwin himself held back because he knew that his particular theory of evolution had more to offer when applied to a different kind of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had never approached the topic from the study of the fossil record and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> his whole technique was quite different to that of many nineteenth-century evolutionists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> Darwin’s later botanical studies were <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of his own personal approach to the problems of evolutionism - but they ignored what many of his contemporaries would have seen as the most important <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in the study of the progress of life on earth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>— 138 — The Emergence of Darwinism Within a decade or two, opponents such as Samuel Butler were complaining that the Darwinists had taken control of the scientific community and established a new dogmatic orthodoxy that suppressed any attempt to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> its basic assumptions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But who were these Darwinians? What did they believe and how did they engineer this transformation? Modern historians now suspect that the answers to such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s are by no means simple.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some Darwinians followed research programmes stemming from the major <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s that Darwin had suggested.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we are to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the scientific revolution that Darwin initiated, we must move beyond the simple assumption that his theory triumphed because an overwhelming body of scientific evidence was immediately brought forward to substantiate it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This suggestion is probably a little too drastic but it does <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to focus attention on the fact that the advent of Darwinism was a social event within the scientific community and must be understood in terms of changing loyalties as well as changing research programmes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was easy for a student of animal form in the abstract to imagine that some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were not shaped by adaptive pressures at all, and equally easy to imagine that the transition from one species to another might be instantaneous, that is, by saltation rather than gradual transformation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He continued to study the geographical distribution of plants with a view to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the role of migration in the evolutionary process.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Huxley is a far more difficult figure to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only in the late 1860s did he begin to search actively for ‘missing links’ in the fossil record that would <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to provide evidence for evolution.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin was able to survive this onslaught primarily because he had prepared the way by building up a small but influential network of naturalists willing to use his idea as an excuse for a renewed assault on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are convinced that Darwin had, in fact, come up with a successful solution to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how species evolve, and have little patience with those of his contemporaries who could not appreciate this.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the theory’s broader implications he still hoped that it would prove possible to reconcile it with a general belief that nature was given the power to develop by a benevolent Creator, but he knew that his own ideas on how the Deity’s intentions were to be realized did not coincide with those of his contemporaries.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They found such an alternative in Lamarck’s old mechanism of the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin himself had never ruled out the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as a supplement to natural selection, and in response to criticism he often insisted that the effect might <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to explain cases where the selection theory seemed to run into difficulties.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>23 But even among the ‘Darwinians’ of the 1860s there were some who gave the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s a much more significant role.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His essay ‘The Development Hypothesis’ of 185124 had tried to promote Lamarckism as the basis for a new assault on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of organic origins.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet Spencer did not abandon Lamarckism for natural selection: his Principles of Biology urged that both the selection of random variation and the preservation of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s must cooperate in the evolutionary process.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their efforts to cope with changes in their environment would produce useful new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (such as the giraffe’s longer neck) which might then be passed on to future generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s Spencer’s emphasis on the individual’s struggle to better itself expressed the Victorians’ faith in self-<strong style='color: red'>help</strong> even more clearly — 170 — The Opponents of Darwinism than Darwin’s natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The problem with natural selection, as far as Spencer was concerned, was that it allowed the individual no freedom to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> itself by its own efforts: if it was born with a harmful <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> then it was doomed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only by allowing for individual self-<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment to participate in evolution was it possible to capture the spirit of the free-enterprise system completely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the liberal ideology, the important aspect of the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s was its implication that the individual had the power to adapt itself to a new environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since Spencer believed that the inevitable consequence of this process over many generations would be progressive evolution, he shared Darwin’s early faith in the <strong style='color: red'>purposefulness</strong> of nature’s activity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the German biologist August Weismann began to argue for a ‘neo-Darwinism’ purged of the Lamarckian element during the 18 80s, Spencer wrote openly in defence of the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>28 The claim that heredity rigidly determined the — 171 — The Opponents of Darwinism individual’s <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was never a part of his philosophy.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And yet the conservatives were forced to accept that some evolution was adaptive, and in their eyes the element of <strong style='color: red'>purposefulness</strong> in the Lamarckian mechanism made it far more acceptable than natural selection as an expression of the Creator’s handiwork.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He soon became convinced not only that the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s was superior to natural selection but that Darwin had been less than honest in his failure to acknowledge the role of his predecessors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In his Evolution Old and New of 1879 Butler developed the claim that the inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s offered a way of reconciling evolutionism with natural theology.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reaction to Chambers’ Vestiges revealed how sensitive the issue was and confirmed Darwin’s feeling that it was necessary to deflect attention to more technical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s so that the case for evolutionism could be discussed more freely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Origin of Species thus avoids the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of human origins except for a single statement that Darwin felt honour-bound to include so that he could not be accused of concealing his beliefs: ‘Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The inheritance of acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s works for mental functions as well as physical structures such as the giraffe’s neck.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As our ancestors learned to live in tribes, so they would have built up the instincts that would regulate behaviour to make <strong style='color: red'>cooperation</strong> and other forms of social interaction possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He studied his own children as a means of trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the order in which the various mental functions appear in the developing mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the assumption that instincts are somehow imprinted into the physical structure of the brain, they must be subject to some individual variation just like any other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the public response to the Origin of Species persuaded Darwin that he must address the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of human origins more directly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The argument began over the fairly technical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how closely the human species was related to the great apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can see no necessity for calling in an additional and proximate cause in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In effect Darwin had to provide what modern evolutionists call an ‘adaptive scenario’ to explain why our ancestors had evolved <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s — 187 — Human Origins that separated them from the apes.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In part this would result from what is now known as ‘group selection’: because of the advantages conferred by <strong style='color: red'>cooperation</strong>, those groups with — 188 — Human Origins more strongly developed social instincts would displace others in which those instincts were less powerful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the size of our societies has increased we have inevitably been led to generalize the moral imperatives forced upon us by evolution, creating religious and moral theories designed to convince us that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for others is an absolute good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s Darwin was a child of his own time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, if no other, Darwin was a ‘social Darwinist’.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even Wallace suggested that the races had branched apart from one another in the remote past and had <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d independently towards the modern human form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was also suspicious of the claim that several related lines could independently <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in the same direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin was prepared to accept that some races have <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d more rapidly in the area of mental progress, perhaps because they have been exposed to a more challenging environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he remained puzzled by many of the physical specializations that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize the modern races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps the negroes’ black coloration was somehow correlated with their bodies’ resistance to tropical diseases, but Darwin found it difficult to see how other racial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics could be explained in terms of adaptation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If particular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s had become associated with sexual attractiveness in certain populations, those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would be enhanced because individuals possessing them to a high degree would reproduce more often than average.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A classic example was that of the Hottentot women in whom ‘the posterior part of the body projects in a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful manner’ a peculiarity which is ‘greatly admired by the men’.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps the clearest evidence that cultural evolutionism was not — l9l — Human Origins merely a spin-off from its biological equivalent can be seen in the very non-Darwinian <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the developmental model used by the archaeologists and anthropologists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Archaeologists such as John Lubbock divided the stone age into a progressive sequence of stages defined by <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments in toolmaking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In effect, modern primitives were relics of the stone age, cultural fossils preserved in areas where the environment did not provide sufficient stimulus for them to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> further up the scale.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin himself drew on this progressionist model in the Descent of Man in order to create the impression that mankind must have <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d from very primitive origins.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>15 To the extent that the Descent of Man made use of the archaeologists’ progressionist model of prehistory, it deflected attention away from the crucial <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of why our earliest ancestors had diverged from those of the apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The developmental scheme postulated in cultural evolution simply assumed that progress was aimed at a single goal (the creation of modern civilization) and used environmental factors merely to explain why some races had <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d further up the scale than others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is significant that Darwin’s heir-apparent in the field of mental evolution, George John Romanes, adopted an explicitly developmental approach that paid little or no attention to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of why the human race had ascended so much further than the apes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Romanes paid little attention to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of why evolutionary pressures should have generated each successive <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> - like Spencer he assumed that progress was more or less inevitable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Given this essentially teleological framework, it is small <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that Romanes retained an interest in — 193 — Human Origins formal religion throughout his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er and, after passing through an agnostic phase, returned eventually to an acceptance of Christianity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin’s brief <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> that his theory of branching evolution made it necessary to specify unique circumstances leading to the establishment of a distinctively human line of evolution was obscured by his own and his followers’ preference for a system in which progress towards higher levels of mentality was taken for granted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what did this progressionist synthesis imply for the social policies of the time? The critics of Darwinism - then and now - imply that the theory opens the floodgates that will allow all traditional moral values to be swept away by a ruthless <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of brute force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nature itself was designed to promote the growth of those values that we hold dear, and thus we can feel pride in our position as the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> guard in the inevitable <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> towards higher things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anthropologists such as Lubbock were quite convinced that modern ‘savages’ retained a primitive level of culture because their mentality remained at a lower level than the more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d whites.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their displacement by the more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d types was only a matter of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The paradox of progressionism was that a belief in the purposeful <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of evolution could be combined with a ruthless attitude towards nature’s failures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>According to some historians Darwinism did indeed usher in a materialistic ethic in which all traditional values were swept away by a <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of brute force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is certainly true that Darwin drew some of his inspiration from the individualism that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized the society in which he lived, and was well read in the classics of laissez-faire economics, including Adam Smith and, of course, Malthus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Descent of Man Darwin noted that the civilized nations have circumvented the ability of natural selection to eliminate the unfit by instituting poor laws, medical <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and other ways of <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing the unfortunate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the moral qualities, some elimination of the worst <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s is always in progress even in the most civilized nations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>20 Thus, far from promoting sheer ruthlessness, natural selection is still <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing to develop the cooperative instincts which lie at the basis of morality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Evolution for the species came about through the accumulation of many generations of individual self-<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, which Spencer assumed would be transmitted from parent to offspring through education.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Human Origins Darwin and Spencer used the concept of the struggle for existence in quite different ways: where Darwin postulated selection acting upon a random variation of hereditary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, Spencer thought most individuals could transcend the limits of inheritance if stimulated by the threat of suffering.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin saw selection as a force that enhanced the social instincts lying at the heart of morality, while Spencer thought that nature rewarded hard work, thrift and initiative as a means of building those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics into the very nature of humanity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The suffering of the unfit was an unfortunate by-product, a necessary harshness designed to eliminate the unfit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in future generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To become a strict Darwinian in human affairs one would have to insist that all aspects of <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> are rigidly determined by heredity, and that progress can only come about through the constant elimination of those individuals unfortunate enough to be born with inferior <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Galton distrusted Darwin’s theory of pangenesis because he preferred to believe that heredity is a much more rigid force determining how parental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are transmitted to the offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They preferred Spencer’s appeal to nature’s hardships as a means of stimulating the unfit to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What, then, should we mean by ‘Darwinism’? Is it the theory of open-ended divergent evolution brought about by natural selection that modern biologists find so exciting, or is it the compromise that Darwin and his contemporaries favoured in which evolution is the mechanism of inevitable progress? There is no simple answer to this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin is a major figure in the history of science because in at least some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s he transcended the values of his own time to create an idea that had the potential for development in later decades.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We should never forget the extent to which he shared the common attitudes of Victorian Britain, but if we pretend that he did nothing more than project those attitudes onto nature we miss the spark of <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> which gave his theory permanent value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The 1870s saw a gradual <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in Darwin’s health, allowing him to continue work on the botanical projects described above in chapter 8.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Darwin retained a faith in the ultimately progressive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of evolution, he was wise enough to realize that it was only in the long term that such a trend would become apparent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of whether there might be some more general element of design in the world he remained confused.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin, with reference to some of his own remarkable works on the ‘Fertilisation of Orchids,’ — 206 — Darwin and the Modern World and upon ‘The Earthworms,’ and various other observations he made of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful contrivances for certain purposes in nature — I said it was impossible to look at these without seeing that they were the effect and the expression of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Biogeography was a major focus of attention in the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ers of evolutionists such as Wallace and Hooker.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In his early <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er the experience of the Galapagos had taught Darwin that geographical isolation was an important factor in speciation (the splitting up of a single parent species into a number of ‘daughter’ species).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin had been willing to allow a role for Lamarckism because he had found it impossible to break with the old viewpoint in which the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are transmitted from parent to offspring is subordinated to the more general problem of how the offspring’s body grows from the material supplied by the parents (the egg and sperm).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was almost impossible for a nineteenth-century biologist to conceive of a study that would concentrate solely on the transmission of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, bypassing the problem of how those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were developed in the growing organism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In such a climate of opinion it was very difficult to think of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as being discrete units transmitted unchanged from one generation to the next.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He realized that natural selection threw the emphasis onto those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s that were preserved intact by heredity, but he was incapable of visualizing those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as units that could be transmitted independently of the process by which they are produced in the growing organism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But pangenesis allowed for the inheritance pf acquire4 <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as well as for random variation, and this was why jDaqyin failed to confront the possibility that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s could be transmitted as units.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As Weismann correctly realized, his vision of the germ plasm’s role made Lamarckism impossible; variation must be the product of changes taking place purely within the germ plasm, and natural selection alone can direct the way in which new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s can build up within the population.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have already seen in chapter 10 how Galton became convinced that the human <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> is rigidly determined by heredity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He developed statistical techniques to allow the study of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> distribution in populations over many generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although Galton himself favoured saltations to originate new species, his approach focused attention on the population and <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to clarify an important point of relevance to Darwin’s theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Like most of his contemporaries Darwin had tended to visualize heredity and variation as two antagonistic processes: heredity was responsible for accurately copying parental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in the offspring, while variation interfered with this process to produce — 213 — Darwin and the Modern World differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pearson was actively hostile to the idea that discrete <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s could be traced because he saw the variation of a population as a continuous range, with most individuals clustered around the midpoint of the range.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in the closing years of the century several factors coincided to make possible the emergence of a new science based on the identification of unit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, a science that would at first be known as Mendelism but which would finally take on its modern name, genetics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the same time the study of variation was leading a few biologists towards the construction of breeding experiments that could trace <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s through a number of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Carl Correns and Hugo De Vries showed that certain plant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s can be treated as distinct units that are visible over many generations, even though in some cases the ‘recessive’ version of a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is completely masked by the ‘dominant’ form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the start of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er Bateson had been trained as an evolutionary morphologist and had attempted to reconstruct the origin of the vertebrates by studying the embryology of some of the lowest modern forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the hope of turning evolution into an experimental science Bateson began to study variation and he soon became interested in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s that seemed most likely to have been produced instantaneously rather than by the accumulation of minute differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He attacked the selection theory vigorously, claiming that the environment had no power to interfere with the production of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by saltations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the hope of identifying the distinct <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s produced in this way he began to set up breeding experiments and was thus well prepared to acknowledge the significance of Mendel’s laws when they were announced by Correns and De Vries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Far from being hailed as the salvation of Darwinism, then, the new science of genetics was founded by biologists who were convinced that evolution took place by the sudden appearance of discrete new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bateson had no time for Darwinism, and Pearson, whose biometrical approach was firmly committed to the natural selection of continuously varying <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, rejected the discrete units of the Mendelians as irrelevant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Attention was now firmly fixed on the ability of heredity to transmit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in an absolutely fixed manner from one generation to the next.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The geneticists were no longer interested in the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of how the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were manifested in individual development and they were thus not inclined to see growth as a force directing evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lamarckism and orthogenesis — 215 — Darwin and the Modern World were inconceivable within their view of heredity: evolution consisted of the production of new genetic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by mutation, and mutation was a process that could not be controlled by events taking place during the growth of the embryo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Evolution was the process by which new genetic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s were introduced into the population.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The only <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s remaining were: how large are the new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and does selection by the environment have any control over how new mutations spread into the population? Over the next few decades the geneticists gradually realized that large mutations are invariably harmful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If evolution is to make use of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s produced in this way, it is likely to be only the smaller changes that will have a chance to be perpetuated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fisher was one of Pearson’s students but he soon realized that the statistical approach of biometry would have to take account of the genetical processes responsible for the transmission of unit <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He showed that the continuous range of variation studied by the Darwinians was actually sustained by the circulation of a number of genetic factors, each of which had some effect on a particular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fisher also showed how natural selection could alter the range of variation by enhancing the reproduction of those genes responsible for producing a favourable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> within a particular environment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what role did Darwin’s theory play in the loss of faith that is so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of modern times? Critics such as the creationists blame evolutionism for most of the world’s ills.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But did Darwin’s theory really play such a decisive role in undermining faith in the purposeful <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the universe which produced us? We have seen that, in his own time, evolutionism succeeded only because it pandered to the prevailing faith that nature was progressive and hence purposeful in its actions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such an attitude would have emerged in Victorian times without Darwin’s <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of course.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet we should be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to recognize the other factors that were involved in the rise of militarism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Modern science honours Darwin both as the focus for the debate which established evolutionism as an integral part of biology and as the founder of the mechanism which is still <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the most plausible explanation of how evolution works.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any attempt to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> Darwin the man must first take into account the multiple roles that his name has played within the symbolism of both nineteenth-and twentieth-century thought.</li>
