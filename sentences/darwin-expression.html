<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless they are faithful copies, and are much superior for my purpose to any drawing, however <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully executed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>MANY works have been written on Expression, but a greater number on Physiognomy,--that is, on the <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> through the study of the permanent form of the features.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The older treatises,[1] which I have consulted, have been of little or no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Another somewhat old essay, namely, the 'Discours,' delivered 1774-1782, by the well-known Dutch anatomist Camper,[3] can hardly be considered as having made any marked <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in the subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The following works, on the contrary, deserve the fullest <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is generally admitted that his <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation which exists between the movements of expression and those of respiration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bell devrait etre medite par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de l'homme, par les philosophes aussi bien que par les artistes, car, sous une apparence plus legere et sous le pretexte de l'esthetique, c'est un des plus beaux monuments de la science des <strong style='color: red'>rapport</strong>s du physique et du moral.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreau, in speaking of the act of frowning, that is, of the contraction of the muscle called by French writers the _soucilier_ (_corrigator supercilii_), remarks with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>:--"Cette action des sourciliers est un des symptomes les plus tranches de l'expression des affections penibles ou concentrees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is a very unusual manner of determining the priority of scientific works; but such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s are of extremely little importance in comparison with their relative merits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the above passage there is but a slight, if any, <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in the philosophy of the subject, beyond that reached by the painter Le Brun, who, in 1667, in describing the expression of fright, says:--"Le sourcil qui est abaisse d'un cote et eleve de l'autre, fait voir que la partie elevee semble le vouloir joindre au cerveau pour le garantir du mal que l'ame apercoit, et le cote qui est abaisse et qui parait enfle,--nous fait trouver dans cet etat par les esprits qui viennent du cerveau en abondance, comme polir couvrir l'aine et la defendre du mal qu'elle craint; la bouche fort ouverte fait voir le saisissement du coeur, par le sang qui se retire vers lui, ce qui l'oblige, voulant respirer, a faire un effort qui est cause que la bouche s'ouvre extremement, et qui, lorsqu'il passe par les organes de la voix, forme un son qui n'est point articule; que si les muscles et les veines paraissent enfles, ce n'est que par les esprits que le cerveau envoie en ces parties-la.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Duchenne has greatly <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d the subject by his treatment of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one has more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully studied the contraction of each separate muscle, and the consequent furrows produced on the skin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has also, and this is a very important <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, shown which muscles are least under the separate control of the will.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He enters very little into theoretical <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, and seldom attempts to explain why certain muscles and not others contract under the influence of certain emotions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>65), is as follows:--"Il resulte, de tous les faits que j'ai rappeles, que les sens, l'<strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> et la pensee ellememe, si elevee, si abstraite qu'on la suppose, ne peuvent s'exercer sans eveiller un sentiment correlatif, et que ce sentiment se traduit directement, sympathiquement, symboliquement ou metaphoriquement, dans toutes les spheres des organs exterieurs, qui la racontent tous, suivant leur mode d'action propre, comme si chacun d'eux avait ete directement affecte.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Si une bille devie legerement de la direction que le joueur pretend zlui imprimer, ne l'avez-vous pas vu cent fois la pousser du <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>, de la tete et meme des epaules, comme si ces mouvements, purement symboliques, pouvaient rectifier son trajet? Des mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la bille manque d'une impulsion suffisante.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>212) the following case:--"un jeune chien A oreilles droites, auquel son maitre presente de loin quelque viande appetissante, fixe avec ardeur ses yeux sur cet objet dont il suit tous les mouvements, et pendant que les yeux <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ent, les deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet pouvait etre entendu.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Here, instead of speaking of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> between the ears and eyes, it appears to me more simple to believe, that as dogs during many generations have, whilst intently looking at any object, pricked their ears in order to perceive any sound; and conversely have looked intently in the direction of a sound to which they may have listened, the movements of these organs have become firmly associated together through long-continued habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Here we have, as I believe, the true theory of a large number of expressions; but the chief interest and difficulty of the subject lies in following out the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully complex results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I infer that some one (but who he is I have not been able to ascertain) formerly <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d a nearly similar view, for Sir C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[14] But man himself cannot express love and <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong> by external signs, so plainly as does a dog, when with drooping ears, hanging lips, flexuous body, and wagging tail, he meets his beloved master.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bell had been <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed about the expression of affection in the dog, he would no doubt have answered that this animal had been created with special instincts, adapting him for association with man, and that all further enquiry on the subject was superfluous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By this doctrine, anything and everything can be equally well explained; and it has proved as pernicious with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Expression as to every other branch of natural history.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we witness any deep emotion, our <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is so strongly excited, that close observation is forgotten or rendered almost impossible; of which fact I have had many curious proofs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> is another and still more serious source of error; for if from the nature of the circumstances we expect to see any expression, we readily imagine its presence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to acquire as good a foundation as possible, and to ascertain, independently of common opinion, how far particular movements of the features and gestures are really expressive of certain states of the mind, I have found the following means the most <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This excellent observer has with unwearied kindness sent me copious notes and descriptions, with valuable suggestions on many points; and I can hardly over-estimate the value of his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several of the expressions were instantly recognised by almost everyone, though described in not exactly the same terms; and these may, I think, be relied on as <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>ful, and will hereafter be specified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, the most widely different judgments were pronounced in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to some of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This exhibition was of use in another way, by convincing me how easily we may be misguided by our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>; for when I first looked through Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Duchenne's photographs, reading at the same time the text, and thus learning what was intended, I was struck with admiration at the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>fulness of all, with only a few exceptions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[19] The story of the composition is generally told with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful force and <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> by skilfully given accessories.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These queries were written after a considerable interval of time, during which my attention had been otherwise directed, and I can now see that they might have been greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) When a man is indignant or defiant does he frown, hold his body and head erect, square his shoulders and clench his fists? (4) When considering deeply on any subject, or trying to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> any puzzle, does he frown, or wrinkle the skin beneath the lower eyelids? (5.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It follows, from the information thus acquired, that the same state of mind is expressed throughout the world with remarkable uniformity; and this fact is in itself interesting as evidence of the close similarity in bodily structure and mental <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of all the races, of mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sixthly, and lastly, I have attended as closely as I could, to the expression of the several passions in some of the commoner animals; and this I believe to be of paramount importance, not of course for deciding how far in man certain expressions are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of certain states of mind, but as affording the safest basis for generalisation on the causes, or origin, of the various movements of Expression.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In observing animals, we are not so likely to be biassed by our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the reasons above assigned, namely, the fleeting nature of some expressions (the changes in the features being often extremely slight); our <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> being easily aroused when we behold any strong emotion, and our attention thus distracted; our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> deceiving us, from knowing in a vague manner what to expect, though certainly few of us know what the exact changes in the countenance are; and lastly, even our long familiarity with the subject,--from all these causes combined, the observation of Expression is by no means easy, as many persons, whom I have asked to observe certain points, have soon discovered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it is difficult to determine, with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>, what are the movements of the features and of the body, which commonly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize certain states of the mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there remains the much greater difficulty of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the cause or origin of the several expressions, and of judging whether any theoretical explanation is trustworthy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter method, I am inclined to think, is the most <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able of all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difficulty of judging of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of any theoretical explanation, and of testing it by some distinct line of investigation, is the great drawback to that interest which the study seems well fitted to excite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to my own observations, I may state that they were commenced in the year 1838; and from that time to the present day, I have occasionally attended to the subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>-------- I will now give the names of the gentlemen to whom, as I have said, I am deeply indebted for information in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the expressions exhibited by various races of man, and I will specify some of the circumstances under which the observations were in each case made.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Maoris of New Zealand, the Rev.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Rajah Brooke has given me some information with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Dyaks of Borneo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Respecting the Malays, I have been highly successful; for Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Scott, curator of the Botanic Gardens, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed the various tribes of men therein employed during a considerable period, and no one has sent me such full and valuable details.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Turning to Africa, I have been unfortunate with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the negroes, though Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would have been comparatively easy to have obtained information in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the negro slaves in America; but as they have long associated with white men, such observations would have possessed little value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bridges, a catechist residing with the Fuegians, answered some few <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s about their expression, addressed to him many years ago.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Washington Matthews Assistant-Surgeon in the United States Army, also observed with special <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> (after having seen my queries, as printed in the 'Smithsonian Report') some of the wildest tribes in the Western parts of the United States, namely, the Tetons, Grosventres, Mandans, and Assinaboines; and his answers have proved of the highest value.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The three chief principles stated--The first principle--Serviceable actions become habitual in association with certain states of the mind, and are performed whether or not of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in each particular case--The force of habit--Inheritance--Associated habitual movements in man--Reflex actions--Passage of habits into reflex actions--Associated habitual movements in the lower animals--Concluding remarks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_The principle of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able associated Habits_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Certain complex actions are of direct or indirect <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> under certain states of the mind, in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations, desires, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Certain states of the mind lead to certain habitual actions, which are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, as under our first principle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to our _first Principle_, it is notorious how powerful is the force of habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That some physical change is produced in the nerve-cells or nerves which are habitually used can hardly be doubted, for otherwise it is impossible to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the tendency to certain acquired movements is inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Erskine in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to his countrymen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In most of the foregoing cases, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the associated movements were acquired through habit; but with some individuals, certain strange gestures or tricks have arisen in association with certain states of the mind, owing to wholly inexplicable causes, and are undoubtedly inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are other actions which are commonly performed under certain circumstances, independently of habit, and which seem to be due to imitation or some sort of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we are conscious of the presence of an irritating particle in our nostrils or windpipe--that is, when the same sensory nerve-cells are excited, as in the case of sneezing and coughing--we can voluntarily expel the particle by forcibly driving air through these passages; but we cannot do this with nearly the same force, rapidity, and <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, as by a reflex action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These latter movements, however, can be prevented, if the danger does not appear to the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> imminent; but our reason telling us that there is no danger does not suffice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My will and reason were powerless against the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> of a danger which had never been experienced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The violence of a start seems to depend partly on the vividness of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, and partly on the condition, either habitual or temporary, of the nervous system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was obviously impossible that a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully-guarded infant could have learnt by experience that a rattling sound near its eyes indicated danger to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The radiation of nerve-force from strongly-excited nerve-cells to other connected cells, as in the case of a bright light on the retina causing a sneeze, may perhaps aid us in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how some reflex actions originated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, dogs of all kinds when intently watching and slowly approaching their prey, frequently keep one of their fore-legs doubled up for a long time, ready for the next cautious step; and this is eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the pointer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, if we rightly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the meaning of the above cat-like habit, of which there can be little doubt, we have a purposeless remnant of an habitual movement, which was originally followed by some remote progenitor of the dog-genus for a definite purpose, and which has been retained for a prodigious length of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dogs scratch themselves by a rapid movement of one of their hind-feet; and when their backs are rubbed with a stick, so strong is the habit, that they cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> rapidly scratching the air or the ground in a useless and ludicrous manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In like manner the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful power which a chicken possesses only a few hours after being hatched, of picking up small particles of food, seems to be started into action through the sense of hearing; for with chickens hatched by artificial heat, a good observer found that "making a noise with the finger-nail against a board, in imitation of the hen-mother, first taught them to peck at their meat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have now, I think, sufficiently shown the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of our first Principle, namely, that when any sensation, desire, dislike, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certain states of the mind lead, as we have seen in the last chapter, to certain habitual movements which were primarily, or may still be, of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; and we shall find that when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these have never been of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not one of the above movements, so clearly expressive of affection, are of the least direct <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, not a little difficult to represent affection in a dog, whilst <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing his master and wagging his tail, as the essence of the expression lies in the continuous flexuous movements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>10] Let us now look at a cat in a directly opposite frame of mind, whilst feeling affectionate and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing her master; and mark how opposite is her attitude in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let it further be observed how widely different is the whole bearing of an affectionate cat from that of a dog, when with his body crouching and flexuous, his tail lowered and wagging, and ears depressed, he <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses his master.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any one who has watched monkeys will not doubt that they perfectly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> each other's gestures and expression, and to a large extent, as Rengger asserts,[201] those of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the power of intercommunication is certainly of high <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to many animals, there is no _a priori_ improbability in the supposition, that gestures manifestly of an opposite nature to those by which certain feelings are already expressed, should at first have been voluntarily employed under the influence of an opposite state of feeling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When two young dogs in play are growling and biting each other's faces and legs, it is obvious that they mutually <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> each other's gestures and manners.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It cannot be supposed that he knew that I should <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> his expression, and that he could thus soften my heart and make me give up visiting the hot-house.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this principle alone can I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the gestures and expressions which come under the present head of antithesis have originated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If indeed they are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to man or to any other animal, in aid of inarticulate cries or language, they will likewise be voluntarily employed, and the habit will thus be strengthened.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whether or not of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> as a means of communication, the tendency to perform opposite movements under opposite sensations or emotions would, if we may judge by analogy, become hereditary through long practice; and there cannot be a doubt that several expressive movements due to the principle of antithesis are inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trembling is of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, often of much dis<strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and cannot have been at first acquired through the will, and then rendered habitual in association with any emotion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[302] The manner in which the secretions of the alimentary canal and of certain glands--as the liver, kidneys, or mammae are affected by strong emotions, is another excellent instance of the direct action of the sensorium on these organs, independently of the will or of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able associated habit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The heart, which goes on uninterruptedly beating night and day in so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful a manner, is extremely sensitive to external stimulants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A brief <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the outward signs of some of the stronger sensations and emotions will best serve to show us, although vaguely, in how complex a manner the principle under <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the direct action of the excited nervous system of the body, is combined with the principle of habitually associated, <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able movements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Herbert Spencer remarks, it may be received as an "un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>able <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that, at any moment, the existing quantity of liberated nerve-force, which in an inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling, MUST expend itself in some direction--MUST generate an equivalent manifestation of force somewhere;" so that, when the cerebro-spinal system is highly excited and nerve-force is liberated in excess, it may be expended in intense sensations, active thought, violent movements, or increased activity of the glands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the movements of certain muscles of the face under great suffering, as well as from other emotions, these will be best considered when we treat of the special expressions of man and of the lower animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will now turn to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic symptoms of Rage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it does not seem improbable that the principle of associated habit may in part account for, or at least augment, some of the above-named <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic symptoms of extreme terror.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No emotion is stronger than maternal love; but a mother may feel the deepest love for her <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less infant, and yet not show it by any outward sign; or only by slight <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing movements, with a gentle smile and tender eyes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A physician once remarked to me as a proof of the exciting nature of anger, that a man when excessively jaded will sometimes invent imaginary offences and put himself into a passion, unconsciously for the sake of reinvigorating himself; and since hearing this remark, I have occasionally recognized its full <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter action is perhaps due to the principle of antithesis, betraying an inward sense of <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>lessness and that nothing can be done.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fear again is the most depressing of all the emotions; and it soon induces utter, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less prostration, as if in consequence of, or in association with, the most violent and prolonged attempts to escape from the danger, though no such attempts have actually been made.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A man or animal driven through terror to desperation, is endowed with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful strength, and is notoriously dangerous in the highest degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But actions of this kind are often combined with others, which follow from our first principle, namely, that actions which have often been of direct or indirect <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, under certain states of the mind, in order to gratify or relieve certain sensations, desires, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, are still performed under analogous circumstances through mere habit although of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Naturalists have remarked, I believe with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that social animals, from habitually using their vocal organs as a means of intercommunication, use them on other occasions much more freely than other animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it follows that the voice, from having been habitually employed as a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able aid under certain conditions, inducing pleasure, pain, rage, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the human voice, under the influence of various emotions, has been discussed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one can listen to an eloquent orator or preacher, or to a man calling angrily to another, or to one expressing astonishment, without being struck with the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Spencer further shows that emotional speech, in all the above <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s is intimately related to vocal music, and consequently to instrumental music; and he attempts to explain the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities of both on physiological grounds--namely, on "the general law that a feeling is a stimulus to muscular action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[403] From this fact, and from the analogy of other animals, I have been led to infer that the progenitors of man probably uttered musical tones, before they had acquired the power of articulate speech; and that consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion, it tends to assume, through the principle of association, a musical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Laughter maybe either high or low; so that, with adult men, as Haller long ago remarked,[406] the sound partakes of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the vowels (as pronounced in German) _O_ and _A_; whilst with children and women, it has more of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of _E_ and _I_; and these latter vowel-sounds naturally have, as Helmholtz has shown, a higher pitch than the former; yet both tones of laughter equally express enjoyment or amusement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Litchfield, who has long attended to the subject of music, has been so kind as to give me the following remarks:--"The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, what is the essence of musical 'expression' involves a number of obscure points, which, so far as I am aware, are as yet unsolved enigmas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A great part of the emotional effect of a song depends on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the action by which the sounds are produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In songs, for instance, which express great vehemence of passion, the effect often chiefly depends on the forcible utterance of some one or two <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic passages which demand great exertion of vocal force; and it will be frequently noticed that a song of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> fails of its proper effect when sung by a voice of sufficient power and range to give the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic passages without much exertion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"It is on this RELATIVE association of the sounds that all the essentially <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic effects which are summed up in the phrase 'musical expression,' depend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" But leaving aside these complex <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s and confining ourselves to the simpler sounds, we can, at least, see some reasons for the association of certain kinds of sounds with certain states of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A scream, for instance, uttered by a young animal, or by one of the members of a community, as a call for <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, will naturally be loud, prolonged, and high, so as to penetrate to a distance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, together with surprise, pain be felt, there is a tendency to contract all the muscles of the body, including those of the face, and the lips will then be drawn back; and this will perhaps account for the sound becoming higher and assuming the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of _Ah!_ or _Ach!_ As fear causes all the muscles of the body to tremble, the voice naturally becomes tremulous, and at the same time husky from the dryness of the mouth, owing to the salivary glands failing to act.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can, I think, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why porcupines have been provided, through the modification of their protective spines, with this special sound-producing instrument.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett, who has had such wide experience with animals of all kinds, does not doubt that this is the case; but it is a different <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the power of erection was primarily acquired for this special purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will first give a considerable body of facts showing how general this action is with mammals, birds and reptiles; retaining what I have to say in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to man for a future chapter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sutton, the intelligent keeper in the Zoological Gardens, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed for me the Chimpanzee and Orang; and he states that when they are suddenly frightened, as by a thunderstorm, or when they are made angry, as by being teased, their hair becomes erect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ford[409] as having his crest of hair "erect and projecting forward, his nostrils dilated, and his under lip thrown down; at the same time uttering his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify his antagonists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I showed a stuffed snake to a Peccary, the hair rose in a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful manner along its back; and so it does with the boar when enraged.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He gives as an instance a hybrid goldfinch of a most irascible <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, which when approached too closely by a servant, instantly assumes the appearance of a ball of ruffled feathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor must we overlook the part which variation and natural selection may have played; for the males which succeeded in making themselves appear the most terrible to their rivals, or to their other enemies, if not of overwhelming power, will on an average have left more offspring to inherit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities, whatever these may be and however first acquired, than have other males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When frogs are seized by snakes, which are their chief enemies, they enlarge themselves <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully; so that if the snake be of small size, as Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The puff-adder (_Clotho arietans_) is remarkable in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>; but I believe, after <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully watching these animals, that they do not act thus for the sake of increasing their apparent bulk, but simply for inhaling a large supply of air, so as to produce their surprisingly loud, harsh, and prolonged hissing sound.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore it is by no means improbable that any sounds or signs by which the venomous species could instantly make themselves recognized as dangerous, would be of more <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to them than to the innocuous species which would not be able, if attacked, to inflict any real injury.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is no greater improbability in various structures, such as the rattle of the rattle-snake,--the lateral scales of the Echis,--the neck with the included ribs of the Cobra,--and the whole body of the puff-adder,--having been modified for the sake of warning and frightening away their enemies, than in a bird, namely, the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful Secretary-hawk (_Gypogeranus_) having had its whole frame modified for the sake of killing snakes with impunity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally we can see that if, on the one hand, those individual snakes, which were best able to frighten away their enemies, escaped best from being devoured; and if, on the other hand, those individuals of the attacking enemy survived in larger numbers which were the best fitted for the dangerous task of killing and devouring venomous snakes;--then in the one case as in the other, beneficial variations, supposing the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to vary, would commonly have been preserved through the survival of the fittest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--The ears through their movements are highly expressive in many animals; but in some, such as man, the higher apes, and many ruminants, they fail in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A savage frame of mind is thus shown, but only in the case of those animals which fight with their teeth; and the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which they take to prevent their ears being seized by their antagonists, accounts for this position.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The movement is different from the falling down and slight drawing back of the ears, when a dog feels pleased and is <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed by his master.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The lynx has remarkably long ears; and their retraction, when one of these animals is approached in its cage, is very conspicuous, and is eminently expressive of its savage <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Lastly, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to monkeys.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, other kinds--and this is a great anomaly in comparison with most other animals--retract their ears, show their teeth, and jabber, when they are pleased by being <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the upright position of the tail, it seems to depend (but whether this is really the case I know not) on the elevator muscles being more powerful than the depressors, so that when all the muscles of the hinder part of the body are in a state of tension, the tail is raised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Speaking of animals in general, including the dog, he says,[502] "C'est toujours la partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses ou les donne.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lorsque toute la longueur des flancs et du corps est sensible, l'animal serpente et rampe sous les <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses; et ces ondulations se propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may be concentrated on the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses of their master! Dogs have another and striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands or faces of their masters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This habit probably originated in the females <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of cleansing them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This was noticed long ago by Somerville, who says, And with a courtly grin, the fawning bound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose Upward he curls, and his large sloe-back eyes Melt in soft blandishments, and <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> joy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ers like a mad creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters, and that from some <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> or connection between the muscles, the tail is then drawn closely inwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they are mutually conscious of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful power of each other's jaws, and are extremely cautious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tamed wolves and jackals, when <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed by their masters, jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground belly upwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[504] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from the Gaboon, depress its ears when <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wolves and jackals, when frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been described as <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ering round his master in circles and figures of eight, like a dog, with his tail between his legs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many years ago I observed in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a very tame English fox, When <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed by the keeper, wagged its tail, depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the attitude assumed by a cat when preparing to fight with another cat, or in any way greatly irritated, is so widely different from that of a dog approaching another dog with hostile intentions; for the cat uses her fore-feet for striking, and this renders a crouching position convenient or necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No cause can be assigned with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> for the tail being lashed or curled from side to side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The distension of the nostrils is not for the sake of scenting the source of danger, for when a horse smells <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully at any object and is not alarmed, he does not dilate his nostrils.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--The various species and genera of monkeys express their feelings in many different ways; and this fact is interesting, as in some degree bearing on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, whether the so-called races of man should be ranked as distinct species or varieties; for, as we shall see in the following chapters, the different races of man express their emotions and sensations with remarkable uniformity throughout the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this wrinkling, which is so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of our own laughter, is more plainly seen in some other monkeys.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The teeth in the upper jaw in the chimpanzee are not exposed when they utter their laughing noise, in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they differ from us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>16] [Illustration: Cynopithecus niger, pleased by being <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>17] I have already had occasion to remark on the curious manner in which two or three species of Alacacus and the _Cynopithecus niger_ draw back their ears and utter a slight jabbering noise, when they are pleased by being <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, however, something strange about this case, for two specimens subsequently kept in the Gardens, and believed to be the same species, have never been seen to weep, though they were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed by the keeper and myself when much distressed and loudly screaming.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The lips of young orangs and chimpanzees are protruded, sometimes to a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful degree, under various circumstances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we try to perform some little action which is difficult and requires <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, for instance, to thread a needle, we generally close our lips firmly, for the sake, I presume, of not disturbing our movements by breathing; and I noticed the same action in a young Orang.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the countenances, and more especially the gestures, of orangs and chimpanzees are in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s highly expressive, I doubt whether on the whole they are so expressive as those of some other kinds of monkeys.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In comparison with man, their faces are inexpressive, chiefly owing to their not frowning under any emotion of the mind--that is, as far as I have been able to observe, and I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to this point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I showed a little dressed-up doll to the _Cynopithecus niger_, it stood motionless, stared intently with widely opened eyes, and <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d its ears a little forwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sufficient facts have now been given with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the expressions of various animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He who will look at a dog preparing to attack another dog or a man, and at the same animal when <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing his master, or will watch the countenance of a monkey when insulted, and when fondled by his keeper, will be forced to admit that the movements of their features and their gestures are almost as expressive as those of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have collected twelve, most of them made purposely for me; and they all exhibit the same general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the order in which the several muscles contract in firmly compressing the eyes, I am indebted to Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fold or furrow may be seen in all the photographs, and is very <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the expression of a crying child; though a nearly similar fold is produced in the act of laughing or Smiling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as the screaming-fit actually began, all the muscles round the eyes were strongly contracted, and the mouth widely opened in the manlier above described; so that at this early period the features assumed the same form as at a more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Piderit[606] lays great stress on the contraction of certain muscles which draw down the nose and narrow the nostrils, as eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of a crying expression.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the crying, however, changes at a very early age, as I noticed in my own infants,--the passionate cry differing from that of grief.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This difference may perhaps be attributed to weeping being restrained, as we shall immediately see, at a more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age, under most circumstances excepting grief; and to the influence of such restraint being transmitted to an earlier period of life, than that at which it was first practised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Crichton Browne, that nothing is more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of simple melancholia, even in the male sex, than a tendency to weep on the slightest occasions, or from no cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The screaming of infants consists of prolonged expirations, with short and rapid, almost spasmodic inspirations, followed at a somewhat more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age by sobbing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old, the inspirations were so rapid and strong that they approached in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to sobbing; when 138 days old I first noticed distinct sobbing, which subsequently followed every bad crying-fit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I may mention, on the same authority, that the whole eye certainly <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s a little during each violent expiration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the protection of the eye during violent expiratory efforts by the pressure of the eyelids, Professor Donders concludes from his various observations that this action certainly limits or entirely removes the dilatation of the vessels.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless much evidence cannot at present be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d to prove that the eye actually suffers injury from the want of support during violent expiration; but there is some.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[617] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the internal vessels, Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bell's observations, and more especially from the more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful investigations by Professor Donders, that the firm closure of the eyelids during the screaming of children is an action full of meaning and of real <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sutton <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee, and he found that both always closed their eyes in sneezing and coughing, but not whilst screaming violently.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless they were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly, and they seemed to contract these muscles; but they moved about their cages so rapidly, that it was difficult to observe with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the several foregoing cases with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Man, there can, I think, be no doubt that the contraction of the muscles round the eyes, during violent expiration or when the expanded chest is forcibly compressed, is, in some manner, intimately connected with the secretion of tears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In these latter cases the secretion of tears is an incidental result, and of no direct <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a further illustration of the view here <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, I may remark that if, during an early period of life, when habits of all kinds are readily established, our infants, when pleased, had been accustomed to utter loud peals of laughter (during which the vessels of their eyes are distended) as often and as continuously as they have yielded when distressed to screaming-fits, then it is probable that in after life tears would have been as copiously and as regularly secreted under the one state of mind as under the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although in accordance with this view we must look at weeping as an incidental result, as purposeless as the secretion of tears from a blow outside the eye, or as a sneeze from the retina being affected by a bright light, yet this does not present any difficulty in our <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how the secretion of tears serves as a relief to suffering.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As Gratiolet remarks, whenever our attention is long concentrated on any subject, we forget to breathe, and then relieve ourselves by a deep inspiration; but the sighs of a sorrowful person, owing to his slow respiration and languid circulation, are eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the eyebrows, they may occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or pretended distress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fold is a highly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered oblique, as may be seen in figs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A lady belonging to a family famous for having produced an extraordinary number of great actors and actresses, and who can herself give this expression "with singular <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>," told Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, more probable that these <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully accurate observers intentionally sacrificed <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> for the sake of beauty, than that they made a mistake; for rectangular furrows on the forehead would not have had a grand appearance on the marble.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Crichton Browne, at my request, closely attended to this expression in the numerous insane patients under his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in the West Biding Asylum; and he is familiar with Duchenne's photographs of the action of the grief-muscles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He informs me that they may constantly be seen in energetic action in cases of melancholia, and especially of hypochondria; and that the persistent lines or furrows, due to their habitual contraction, are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the physiognomy of the insane belonging to these two classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Browne <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed for me during a considerable period three cases of hypochondria, in which the grief-muscles were persistently contracted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Patrick Nicol has also kindly observed for me several cases in the Sussex Lunatic Asylum, and has communicated to me full details with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to three of them; but they need not here be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have, at least, received trustworthy accounts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Hindoos, Dhangars (one of the aboriginal hill-tribes of India, and therefore belonging to a quite distinct race from the Hindoos), Malays, Negroes and Australians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the latter, two observers answer my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> in the affirmative, but enter into no details.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to negroes, the lady who told me of Fra Angelico's picture, saw a negro towing a boat on the Nile, and as he encountered an obstruction, she observed his grief-muscles in strong action, with the middle of the forehead well wrinkled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Scott saw, the eyebrows became slightly oblique, with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic puckering or swelling at the inner ends, but the wrinkles on the forehead were not present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both these cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence of a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is necessary to observe <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully, as the peculiar opposed action of these muscles is not nearly so plain in children, owing to their foreheads not easily wrinkling, as in adults.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, after a little boy had been vaccinated, which made him scream and cry violently, the surgeon gave him an orange brought for the purpose, and this pleased the child much; as he stopped crying all the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic movements were observed, including the formation of rectangular wrinkles in the middle of the forehead.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As children and women cry much more freely than men, and as grown-up persons of both sexes rarely weep except from mental distress, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the grief-muscles are more frequently seen in action, as I believe to be the case, with children and women than with men; and with adults of both sexes from mental distress alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact may indeed be inferred from what has just been stated with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to infants when doubtfully beginning to cry, or endeavouring to stop crying; for they then generally command all the other facial muscles more effectually than they do the depressors of the corners of the mouth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two excellent observers who had no theory on the subject, one of them a surgeon, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully watched for me some older children and women as with some opposed struggling they very gradually approached the point of bursting out into tears; and both observers felt sure that the depressors began to act before any of the other muscles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of this latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in her eyes becoming slightly suffused with tears; and we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this, as the lacrymal glands are less under the control of the will than the facial muscles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Through steps such as these we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is, that as soon as some melancholy thought passes through the brain, there occurs a just perceptible drawing down of the corners of the mouth, or a slight raising up of the inner ends of the eyebrows, or both movements combined, and immediately afterwards a slight suffusion of tears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this case, as well as in many others, the links are indeed <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful which connect cause and effect in giving rise to various expressions on the human countenance; and they explain to us the meaning of certain movements, which we involuntarily and unconsciously perform, whenever certain transitory emotions pass through our minds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[803] Their countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile; their joyousness is increased, and they grin, chuckle, or giggle, whenever food is placed before them, or when they are <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssed, are shown bright colours, or hear music.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Laughter in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> is analogous with weeping, which with adults is almost confined to mental distress, whilst with children it is excited by bodily pain or any suffering, as well as by fear or rage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt there is much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in this view, but not, as it appears to me, the whole <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wrinkles are thus formed under the eyes, and, with old people, at their outer ends; and these are highly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of laughter or smiling.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the disease <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s other muscles become involved, but until complete fatuity is reached, the prevailing expression is that of feeble benevolence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A bright and sparkling eye is as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of a pleased or amused state of mind, as is the retraction of the corners of the mouth and upper lip with the wrinkles thus produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But why the sounds which man utters when he is pleased have the peculiar reiterated <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of laughter we do not know.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For they are all <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic and expressive of a pleased state of mind in various kinds of monkeys.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gaika, the brother of the chief Sandilli, answers my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> on this bead, with the words, "Yes, that is their common practice.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the age of 113 days these little noises, which were always made during expiration, assumed a slightly different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and were more broken or interrupted, as in sobbing; and this was certainly incipient laughter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The art of screaming, on the other hand, from being of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to infants, has become finely developed from the earliest days.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My informants, from various parts of the Old and New Worlds, answer in the affirmative to my queries on this head, and they give some particulars with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Hindoos, Malays, and New Zealanders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We probably owe this desire to inherited habit, in association with the nursing and tending of our children, and with the mutual <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses of lovers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[823] The feelings which are called tender are difficult to analyse; they seem to be compounded of affection, joy, and especially of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sympathy with the distresses of others, even with the imaginary distresses of a heroine in a pathetic story, for whom we feel no affection, readily excites tears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So does <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the happiness of others, as with that of a lover, at last successful after many hard trials in a well-told tale.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sympathy appears to constitute a separate or distinct emotion; and it is especially apt to excite the lacrymal glands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This holds good whether we give or receive <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The feeling of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> is commonly explained by assuming that, when we see or hear of suffering in another, the idea of suffering is called up so vividly in our own minds that we ourselves suffer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this explanation is hardly sufficient, for it does not account for the intimate alliance between <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and affection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We undoubtedly sympathize far more deeply with a beloved than with an indifferent person; and the <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> of the one gives us far more relief than that of the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to joy, its natural and universal expression is laughter; and with all the races of man loud laughter leads to the secretion of tears more freely than does any other cause excepting distress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless it is not a little remarkable that <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the distresses of others should excite tears more freely than our own distress; and this certainly is the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is still more remarkable that <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the happiness or good fortune of those whom we tenderly love should lead to the same result, whilst a similar happiness felt by ourselves would leave our eyes dry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We should, however, bear in mind that the long-continued habit of restraint which is so powerful in checking the free flow of tears from bodily pain, has not been brought into play in preventing a moderate effusion of tears in <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the sufferings or happiness of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Music has a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful power, as I have elsewhere attempted to show,[824] of recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong emotions which were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable, our early progenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as several of our strongest emotions--grief, great joy, love, and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>--lead to the free secretion of tears, it is not surprising that music should be apt to cause our eyes to become suffused with tears, especially when we are already softened by any of the tenderer feelings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--As devotion is, in some degree, related to affection, though mainly consisting of <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>, often combined with fear, the expression of this state of mind may here be briefly noticed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> kneeling posture, with the hands upturned and palms joined, appears to us, from long habit, a gesture so appropriate to devotion, that it might be thought to be innate; but I have not met with any evidence to this effect with the various extra-European races of mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[901] There is much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in these remarks, but hardly the whole <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I asked several persons, without explaining my object, to listen intently to a very gentle tapping sound, the nature and source of which they all perfectly knew, and not one frowned; but a man who joined us, and who could not conceive what we were all doing in profound silence, when asked to listen, frowned much, though not in an ill-temper, and said he could not in the least <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what we all wanted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[904] From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, we may conclude that frowning is not the expression of simple reflection, however profound, or of attention, however close, but of something difficult or displeasing encountered in a train of thought or in action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the same way as naturalists find it advisable to trace the embryological development of an organ in order fully to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> its structure, so with the movements of expression it is advisable to follow as nearly as possible the same plan.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" As the effort of viewing with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> under a bright light a distant object is both difficult and irksome, and as this effort has been habitually accompanied, during numberless generations, by the contraction of the eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been much strengthened; although it was originally practised during infancy from a quite independent cause, namely as the first step in the protection of the eyes during screaming.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The belief that the habit of contracting the brows is continued when there is no need whatever to exclude too much light, receives support from the cases formerly alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are acted on under certain circumstances in a useless manner, from having been similarly used, under analogous circumstances, for a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the forehead should be pressed or rubbed, as deep thought tries the brain; but why the hand should be raised to the mouth or face is far from clear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When I first looked at this photograph, knowing what was intended, my <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> added, as I believe, what was necessary, namely, a frowning brow; and consequently the expression appeared to me true and extremely morose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We thus see that the protrusion of the lips, especially with young children, is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of sulkiness throughout the greater part of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For it is not at all unusual for animals to retain, more or less perfectly, during early youth, and subsequently to lose, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which were aboriginally possessed by their adult progenitors, and which are still retained by distinct species, their near relations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A cross child, sitting on its parent's knee, will lift up the near shoulder, then jerk it away, as if from a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ss, and afterwards give a backward push with it, as if to push away the offender.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, also, a small and weak lower jaw, which seems to indicate that the mouth is not habitually and firmly closed, is commonly thought to be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of feebleness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears to me that there probably is some <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in this view, for we are apt to press the teeth hard together during violent exertion, and this is not requisite to prevent expiration, whilst the muscles of the chest are strongly contracted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The habitual and firm closure of the mouth would thus come to show decision of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and decision readily passes into obstinacy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shakspeare sums up the chief <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of rage as follows:-- "In peace there's nothing so becomes a man, As modest stillness and <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>; But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger: Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit To his full height! On, on, you noblest English.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The lips are sometimes protruded during rage in a manner, the meaning of which I do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, unless it depends on our descent from some ape-like animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He hisses forth his curses through his set teeth, and his whole expression assumes the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of extreme ferocity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Browne remarks, is <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous in a being ordinarily so torpid that he takes about fifteen seconds, when attracted by any noise, to turn his head from one side to the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Maudsley thinks that the same view may be extended to the brain in its degenerated condition in some insane patients; and asks, whence come "the savage snarl, the destructive <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, the obscene language, the wild howl, the offensive habits, displayed by some of the insane? Why should a human being, deprived of his reason, ever become so brutal in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, as some do, unless he has the brute nature within him?"[1012] This <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> must, as it would appear, he answered in the affirmative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--These states of the mind differ from rage only in degree, and there is no marked distinction in their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic signs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The respiration is likewise a little hurried; and as all the muscles serving for this function act in association, the wings of the nostrils are somewhat raised to allow of a free indraught of air; and this is a highly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic sign of indignation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, however, an exception with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to clenching the fists, which seems confined chiefly to the men who fight with their fists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have received similar accounts, except as to the clenching of the fists, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Malays of the Malacca peninsula, the Abyssinians, and the natives of South Africa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the natives of India, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although some persons smile more on one side of their face than on the other, it is not easy to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why in cases of derision the smile, if a real one, should so commonly be confined to one side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bulmer, an Australian missionary in a remote part of Gipps' Land, says, in answer to my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> about the uncovering of the canine on one side, "I find that the natives in snarling at each other speak with the teeth closed, the upper lip drawn to one side, and a general angry expression of face; but they look direct at the person addressed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Three other observers in Australia, one in Abyssinia, and one in China, answer my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> on this head in the affirmative; but as the expression is rare, and as they enter into no details, I am afraid of implicitly trusting them.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gaika in his answers to my queries remarks, that contempt is commonly shown by his countrymen, the Kafirs, by smiling; and the Rajah Brooke makes the same observation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Dyaks of Borneo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the face, moderate disgust is exhibited in various ways; by the mouth being widely opened, as if to let an offensive morsel drop out; by spitting; by blowing out of the protruded lips; or by a sound as of clearing the throat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rothrock, for instance, answers with a decided affirmative with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to certain wild Indian tribes of North America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was all the more comical, as I doubt whether the child felt real disgust--the eyes and forehead expressing much surprise and <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The whole expression of pride stands in direct antithesis to that of <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>; so that nothing need here be said of the latter state of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Helplessness, Impotence: Shrugging the shoulders_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have never seen very young English children shrug their shoulders, but the following case was observed with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> by a medical professor and excellent observer, and has been communicated to me by him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is nothing very unusual, though the fact is interesting, in these children having gained by inheritance a habit during early youth, and then discontinuing it; for it is of frequent occurrence with many kinds of animals that certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are retained for a period by the young, and are then lost.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I presume that it is complete, as, in answer to my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> descriptive of the movements of the shoulders, arms, hands, and face, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Asa Gray saw an Arab dragoman in Alexandria acting exactly as described in my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong>, when an old gentleman, on whom he attended, would not go in the proper direction which had been pointed out to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Barber has never seen this gesture with the Kafirs of South Africa; and Gaika, judging from his answer, did not even <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what was meant by my description.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Australians, four of my informants answer by a simple negative, and one by a simple affirmative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>None of the above movements are of the least <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The actions and attitude of a <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less man are, in every one of these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, exactly the reverse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>we may imagine one of the figures on the left side to have just said, "What do you mean by insulting me?" and one of the figures on the right side to answer, "I really could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less man unconsciously contracts the muscles of his forehead which are antagonistic to those that cause a frown, and thus raises his eyebrows; at the same time he relaxes the muscles about the mouth, so that the lower jaw drops.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less or apologetic man often wishes to show his state of mind, he then acts in a conspicuous or demonstrative manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In accordance with the fact that squaring the elbows and clenching the fists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races, when they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it appears that a <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less or apologetic frame of mind is expressed in many parts of the world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without turning inwards the elbows and opening the hands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lieber stated to the contrary,[1119] I should have imagined that these gestures might have been acquired or learnt by her, considering her <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful sense of touch and appreciation of the movements of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Schmalz, in his remarkable dissertation on the education of the deaf and dumb, as well as of children raised only one degree above idiotcy, assumes that they can always both make and <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the common signs of affirmation and negation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Australians, seven observers agree that a nod is given in affirmation; five agree about a lateral shake in negation, accompanied or not by some word; but Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This movement would perhaps have been described by a less <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer as a lateral shake.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to negation, if we admit that the shaking of the finger or hand from side to side is symbolic of the lateral movement of the head; and if we admit that the sudden backward movement of the head represents one of the actions often practised by young children in refusing food, then there is much uniformity throughout the world in the signs of negation, and we can see how they originated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to nodding in affirmation, the exceptions are rather more numerous, namely with some of the Hindoos, with the Turks, Abyssinians, Dyaks, Tagals, and New Zealanders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This figure expresses surprise with much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I showed it to twenty-four persons without a word of explanation, and one alone did not at all <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what was intended.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) My informants answer with remarkable uniformity to the same effect, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the various races of man; the above movements of the features being often accompanied by certain gestures and sounds, presently to be described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The chief Gaika and others answer _yes_ to my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Kafirs of South Africa; and so do others emphatically with reference to the Abyssinians, Ceylonese, Chinese, Fuegians, various tribes of North America, and New Zealanders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are highly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the expression of surprise or astonishment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ogle[1206] has been so kind as to search the best recent authorities on the functions of the eustachian tube, and he informs me that it is almost conclusively proved that it remains closed except during the act of deglutition; and that in persons in whom the tube remains abnormally open, the sense of hearing, as far as external sounds are concerned, is by no means <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; on the contrary, it is impaired by the respiratory sounds being rendered more distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of my sons was awakened in the night by a noise under circumstances which naturally led to great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and after a few minutes he perceived that his mouth was widely open.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have seen that an indignant man holds his head erect, squares his shoulders, turns out his elbows, often clenches his fist, frowns, and closes his mouth; whilst the attitude of a <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less man is in every one of these details the reverse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Barber says that the Kafirs and Fingoes express astonishment by a serious look and by placing the right hand upon the mouth, Littering the word _mawo_, which means '<strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I use the word 'terror' for extreme fear; but some writers think it ought to be confined to cases in which the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> is more particularly concerned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the skin is much affected under the sense of great fear, we see in the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous and inexplicable manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ogle <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully watched him the next morning, while he was being handcuffed and taken away by the police.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to fear, as exhibited by the various races of man, my informants agree that the signs are the same as with Europeans.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Some of the signs of fear deserve a little further <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Crichton Browne with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the insane.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He has sent me photographs of two women, taken in the intervals between their paroxysms, and he adds with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to one of these women, "that the state of her hair is a sure and convenient criterion of her mental condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>---- will soon <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>, for her hair is getting smooth; and I always notice that our patients get better whenever their hair ceases to be rough and unmanageable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Browne has often seen this muscle quivering and contracting in the insane, he has not been able to connect its action with any emotional condition in them, though he <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to patients suffering from great fear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wood, who has studied with such <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> the muscles of the human body, as shown by his various publications, has often seen the platysma contracted in vomiting, nausea, and disgust; also in children and adults under the influence of rage,--for instance, in Irishwomen, quarrelling and brawling together with angry gesticulations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first sensation of fear, or the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> of something dreadful, commonly excites a shudder.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Munro's statement, that with parrots the iris is affected by the passions, independently of the amount of light, seems to bear on this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; but Professor Donders informs me, that he has often seen movements in the pupils of these birds which he thinks may be related to their power of accommodation to distance, in nearly the same manner as our own pupils contract when our eyes converge for near vision.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In these cases there is no danger to ourselves; but from the power of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> and of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> we put ourselves in the position of the sufferer, and feel something akin to fear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the involuntary bristling of the hair, we have good reason to believe that in the case of animals this action, however it may have originated, serves, together with certain voluntary movements, to make them appear terrible to their enemies; and as the same involuntary and voluntary actions are performed by animals nearly related to man, we are led to believe that man has retained through inheritance a relic of them, now become useless.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many children, at a somewhat more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age blush in a strongly marked manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Crichton Browne observed for me those under his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, but never saw a genuine blush, though he has seen their faces flash, apparently from joy, when food was placed before them, and from anger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Paget then perceived that by asking this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> he had caused the mother to blush; and she exhibited the same peculiarity as her daughter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Browne, together with his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants, visited her whilst she was in bed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a rather curious <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> why, in most cases the face, ears, and neck alone redden, inasmuch as the whole surface of the body often tingles and grows hot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Stack so much that he could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> bursting out into a laugh; and then "the old man blushed up to the roots of his hair.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This latter statement agrees with what I remember of the Fuegian, Jemmy Button, who blushed when he was quizzed about the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which he took in polishing his shoes, and in otherwise adorning himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Aymara Indians on the lofty plateaus of Bolivia, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Forbes says,[1313] that from the colour of their skins it is impossible that their blushes should be as clearly visible as in the white races; still under such circumstances as would raise a blush in us, "there can always be seen the same expression of <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> or confusion; and even in the dark, a rise of temperature of the skin of the face can be felt, exactly as occurs in the European.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the capillaries of the face in the negro become filled with blood, under the emotion of shame, we may feel confident; because a perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized albino negress, described by Buffon,[1317] showed a faint tinge of crimson on her cheeks when she exhibited herself naked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The true explanation apparently lies in the intimate <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> which exists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and face, and that of the brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, there exists, as cannot be doubted, an intimate <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> between the capillary circulation in that part of the brain on which our mental powers depend, and in the skin of the face, it is not surprising that the moral causes which induce intense blushing should likewise induce, independently of their own disturbing influence, much confusion of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--These consist of shyness, shame, and <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>; the essential element in all being self-attention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hereafter the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> will be discussed, how it has arisen that the consciousness that others are attending to our personal appearance should have led to the capillaries, especially those of the face, instantly becoming filled with blood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1325] A young man, not very liable to blush, will blush intensely at any slight ridicule of his appearance from a girl whose judgment on any important subject lie would dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bridges, blush "chiefly in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to women, but certainly also at their own personal appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Of all parts of the body, the face is most considered and <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed, as is natural from its being the chief seat of expression and the source of the voice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1326] The face, therefore, will have been subjected during many generations to much closer and more earnest self-attention than any other part of the body; and in accordance with the principle here <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why it should be the most liable to blush.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as the face is the part of the body which is most <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed, it is intelligible that any one ashamed of his personal appearance would desire to conceal this part of his body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The habit, so general with every one who feels ashamed, of turning away, or lowering his eyes, or restlessly moving them from side to side, probably follows from each glance directed towards those present, bringing home the conviction that he is intently <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed; and he endeavours, by not looking at those present, and especially not at their eyes, momentarily to escape from this painful conviction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shyness seems to depend on sensitiveness to the opinion, whether good or bad, of others, more especially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to external appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Strangers neither know nor <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> anything about our conduct or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but they may, and often do, criticize our appearance: hence shy persons are particularly apt to be shy and to blush in the presence of strangers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Persons who are exceedingly shy are rarely shy in the presence of those with whom they are quite familiar, and of whose good opinion and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> they are perfectly assured;--for instance, a girl in the presence of her mother.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With very young children it is difficult to distinguish between fear and shyness; but this latter feeling with them has often seemed to me to partake of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the wildness of an untamed animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to blushing from strictly moral causes, we meet with the same fundamental principle as before, namely, <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the opinion of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless as they depend on the fixed custom of our equals and superiors, whose opinion we highly <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>, they are considered almost as binding as are the laws of honour to a gentleman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So strong, also, is the power of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> that a sensitive person, as a lady has assured me, will sometimes blush at a flagrant breach of etiquette by a perfect stranger, though the act may in no way concern her.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Modesty_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--This is another powerful agent in exciting blushes; but the word <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> includes very different states of the mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It implies <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>, and we often judge of this by persons being greatly pleased and blushing at slight praise, or by being annoyed at praise which seems to them too high according to their own <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> standard of themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blushing here has the usual signification of <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the opinion of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> frequently relates to acts of indelicacy; and indelicacy is an affair of etiquette, as we clearly see with the nations that go altogether or nearly naked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A blush due to this form of <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> is, moreover, apt to be intense, because it generally relates to the opposite sex; and we have seen how in all cases our liability to blush is thus increased.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We apply the term 'modest,' as it would appear, to those who have an <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> opinion of themselves, and to those who are extremely sensitive about an indelicate word or deed, simply because in both cases blushes are readily excited, for these two frames of mind have nothing else in common.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shyness also, from this same cause, is often mistaken for <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> in the sense of <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several ladies, who are great blushers, are unanimous in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to solitude; and some of them believe that they have blushed in the dark.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Forbes has stated with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Aymaras, and from my own sensations, I have no doubt that this latter statement is correct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this be so, we must attribute the result to the force of inveterate habit and association, under a state of mind closely analogous to that which ordinarily excites a blush; nor need we feel surprise at this, as even <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with another person who commits a flagrant breach of etiquette is believed, as we have just seen, sometimes to cause a blush.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, then, I conclude that blushing,--whether due to shyness--to shame for a real crime--to shame from a breach of the laws of etiquette--to <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> from <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>--to <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> from an indelicacy--depends in all cases on the same principle; this principle being a sensitive <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the opinion, more particularly for the depreciation of others, primarily in relation to our personal appearance, especially of our faces; and secondarily, through the force of association and habit, in relation to the opinion of others on our conduct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The belief that blushing was SPECIALLY designed by the Creator is opposed to the general theory of evolution, which is now so largely accepted; but it forms no part of my <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> here to argue on the general <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who believe in design, will find it difficult to account for shyness being the most frequent and efficient of all the causes of blushing, as it makes the blusher to suffer and the beholder uncomfortable, without being of the least <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to either of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Through the force of association, the same effects will tend to follow whenever we think that others are considering or censuring our actions or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, my father told me of a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, who certainly had heart-disease and died from it, and who positively stated that his pulse was habitually irregular to an extreme degree; yet to his great disappointment it invariably became regular as soon as my father entered the room.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we direct our whole attention to any one sense, its acuteness is increased;[1340] and the continued habit of close attention, as with blind people to that of hearing, and with the blind and deaf to that of touch, appears to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the sense in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> permanently.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By what means attention--perhaps the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful of all the wondrous powers of the mind--is effected, is an extremely obscure subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, the power of attention seems to rest, either chiefly, or as some physiologists think, exclusively, on the vaso-motor system being affected in such a manner that more blood is allowed to flow into the capillaries of the part in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To give another, and, in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, more appropriate illustration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Men and women, and especially the young, have always valued, in a high degree, their personal appearance; and have likewise <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed the appearance of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our self-attention is excited almost exclusively by the opinion of others, for no person living in absolute solitude would <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> about his appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Through the force, also, of association and inheritance our capillaries are relaxed, whenever we know, or imagine, that any one is blaming, though in silence, our actions, thoughts, or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and, again, when we are highly praised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this hypothesis we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that the face blushes much more than any other part of the body, though the whole surface is somewhat affected, more especially with the races which still go nearly naked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the young are much more affected than the old, and women more than men; and why the opposite sexes especially excite each other's blushes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to real shame from moral delinquencies, we can perceive why it is not guilt, but the thought that others think us guilty, which raises a blush.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A man reflecting on a crime committed in solitude, and stung by his conscience, does not blush; yet he will blush under the vivid recollection of a detected fault, or of one committed in the presence of others, the degree of blushing being closely related to the feeling of <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for those who have detected, witnessed, or suspected his fault.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Modesty from <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong>, or from an indelicacy, excites a vivid blush, as both relate to the judgment or fixed customs of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the intimate <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> which exists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and of the brain, whenever there is intense blushing, there will be some, and often great, confusion of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As blushing, according to this hypothesis, is an indirect result of attention, originally directed to our personal appearance, that is to the surface of the body, and more especially to the face, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the meaning of the gestures which accompany blushing throughout the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The three leading principles which have determined the chief movements of expression--Their inheritance--On the part which the will and intention have played in the acquirement of various expressions--The instinctive <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of expression--The bearing of our subject on the specific unity of the races of man--On the successive acquirement of various expressions by the progenitors of man--The importance of expression--Conclusion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first of these principles is, that movements which are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in gratifying some desire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become so habitual that they are performed, whether or not of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, whenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see also the influence of habit in all the emotions and sensations which are called exciting; for they have assumed this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from having habitually led to energetic action; and action affects, in an indirect manner, the respiratory and circulatory system; and the latter reacts on the brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are as full of significance to us in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to expression, as are ordinary rudiments to the naturalist in the classification and genealogy of organic beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus also <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the fact that the young and the old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the same state of mind by the same movements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, however, we turn to less common gestures in ourselves, which we are accustomed to look at as artificial or conventional,--such as shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence, or the raising the arms with open hands and extended fingers, as a sign of <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>,--we feel perhaps too much surprise at finding that they are innate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The evidence with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the inheritance of nodding and shaking the head, as signs of affirmation and negation, is doubtful; for they are not universal, yet seem too general to have been independently acquired by all the individuals of so many races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the expressive movements due to the principle of antithesis, it is clear that the will has intervened, though in a remote and indirect manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even infants, if <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to, find out at a very early age that their screaming brings relief, and they soon voluntarily practise it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is perhaps worth <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> whether movements at first used only by one or a few individuals to express a certain state of mind may not sometimes have spread to others, and ultimately have become universal, through the power of conscious and unconscious imitation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Patients thus affected imitate, without <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing every absurd gesture which is made, and every word which is uttered near them, even in a foreign language.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An infant may scream either intentionally or instinctively to show that it wants food; but it has no wish or intention to draw its features into the peculiar form which so plainly indicates misery; yet some of the most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic expressions exhibited by man are derived from the act of screaming, as has been explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although most of our expressive actions are innate or instinctive, as is admitted by everyone, it is a different <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether we have any instinctive power of recognizing them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1402] Monkeys soon learn to distinguish, not only the tones of voice of their masters, but the expression of their faces, as is asserted by a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1403] Dogs well know the difference between <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing and threatening gestures or tones; and they seem to recognize a <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>ate tone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as far as I can make out, after repeated trials, they do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> any movement confined to the features, excepting a smile or laugh; and this they appear, at least in some cases, to recognize.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, do our children acquire their knowledge of expression solely by experience through the power of association and reason? As most of the movements of expression must have been gradually acquired, afterwards becoming instinctive, there seems to be some degree of _a priori_ probability that their <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> would likewise have become instinctive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When five months old, he seemed to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> a <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>ate, expression and tone of voice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore it seems to me that an innate feeling must have told him that the pretended crying of his nurse expressed grief; and this through the instinct of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> excited grief in him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lemoine argues that, if man possessed an innate knowledge of expression, authors and artists would not have found it so difficult, as is notoriously the case, to describe and depict the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic signs of each particular state of mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, great ignorance of details does not prevent our recognizing with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> and promptitude various expressions, I do not see how this ignorance can be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d as an argument that our knowledge, though vague and general, is not innate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is far more probable that the many points of close similarity in the various races are due to inheritance from a single parent-form, which had already assumed a human <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disgust would have been shown at a very early period by movements round the mouth, like those of vomiting,--that is, if the view which I have suggested <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the source of the expression is correct, namely, that our progenitors had the power, and used it, of voluntarily and quickly rejecting any food from their stomachs which they disliked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the various facts just alluded to, and given in the course of this volume, it follows that, if the structure of our organs of respiration and circulation had differed in only a slight degree from the state in which they now exist, most of our expressions would have been <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this case we should not have displayed some of our most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic expressions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We readily perceive <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> in others by their expression; our sufferings are thus mitigated and our pleasures increased; and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever amount of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> the so-called science of physiognomy may contain, appears to depend, as Haller long ago remarked,[1404] on different persons bringing into frequent use different facial muscles, according to their <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s; the development of these muscles being perhaps thus increased, and the lines or furrows on the face, due to their habitual contraction, being thus rendered deeper and more conspicuous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shakespeare, who from his <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful knowledge of the human mind ought to be an excellent judge, says:-- Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit, That, from her working, all his visage wann'd; Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! _Hamlet_, act ii.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, as far as possible, the source or origin of the various expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men around us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess much interest for us.</li>
