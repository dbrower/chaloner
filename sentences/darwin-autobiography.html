<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To many this may seem an impossibility; but those who knew my father will <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it was not only possible, but natural.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The autobiography bears the heading, 'Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,' and end with the following note:--"Aug.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] A German Editor having written to me for an account of the development of my mind and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> with some sketch of my autobiography, I have thought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest my children or their children.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember in the early part of my school life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed earnestly to God to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> me, and I well remember that I attributed my success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>led how generally I was aided.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To my deep mortification my father once said to me, "You <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Looking back as well as I can at my <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during my school life, the only qualities which at this period promised well for the future, were, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever interested me, and a keen pleasure in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing any complex subject or thing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle of the vernier of a barometer with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to diversified tastes, independently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare, generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Early in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the <strong style='color: red'>veracity</strong> of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the "Beagle".</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I think that my <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> was then very affectionate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to science, I continued collecting minerals with much zeal, but quite unscientifically--all that I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d about was a new-_named_ mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I must have observed insects with some little <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, for when ten years old (1819) I went for three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in Shropshire.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In my simplicity I remember <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He made all the gases and many compounds, and I read with great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> several books on chemistry, such as Henry and Parkes' 'Chemical Catechism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he called me very unjustly a "poco curante," and as I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why this part of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what medicines to give, which I made up myself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father, who was by far the best judge of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> whom I ever knew, declared that I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would get many patients.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty regularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> about them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I looked at him and at the whole scene with some <strong style='color: red'>awe</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these Societies, more than any other similar honour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful stone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I think of this lecture, I do not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that I determined never to attend to Geology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To hear of praise from an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity, is, I think, good for a young man, as it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s to keep him in the right course.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Accordingly I read with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to be a clergyman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and some time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings, in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a public discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump of <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> developed enough for ten priests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Classics I did nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the attendance was almost nominal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education of my mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By answering well the examination <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were all in the highest spirits, I cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> looking back to these times with much pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was the mere passion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared their external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s with published descriptions, but got them named anyhow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er more than any other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my brother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly prepared to <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot resist mentioning a trifling incident, which showed his kind <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now I do not suppose any other professor of botany could have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed laughing at my coming in such a hurry to make such a communication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he agreed how interesting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how well it was known; so I left him not in the least mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so remarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to communicate my discoveries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I became also acquainted with several other men older than me, who did not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> much about science, but were friends of Henslow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>D<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>s, afterwards Dean of Hereford, and famous for his success in the education of the poor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During my last year at Cambridge, I read with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and profound interest Humboldt's 'Personal Narrative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Herschel's 'Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,' stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I copied out from Humboldt long passages about Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned excursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and D<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>s, for on a previous occasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the party declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think that they were only half in earnest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I was then utterly astonished at Sedgwick not being delighted at so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful a fact as a tropical shell being found near the surface in the middle of England.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We spent many hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, as Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw a trace of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and terminal moraines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Afterwards, on becoming very intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fitz-Roy's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was a singular one, with very many noble features: he was devoted to his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and indomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would undertake any sort of trouble to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> those whom he thought deserved <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s one of the most noble which I have ever known.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The voyage of the "Beagle" has been by far the most important event in my life, and has determined my whole <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er; yet it depended on so small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to Shrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as the shape of my nose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the first real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of observation were <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, though they were always fairly developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had brought with me the first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied attentively; and the book was of the highest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to me in many ways.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jago in the Cape de Verde islands, showed me clearly the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful superiority of Lyell's manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author, whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> when in after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in describing <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good practice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That my mind became developed through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark made by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a sceptical <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for on first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and exclaimed, "Why, the shape of his head is quite altered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I could not at the time <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how he could have learnt anything of my proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had read some of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical Society of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held November 16, 1835, and printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members of the Society.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All this shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that in after years, though I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d in the highest degree for the approbation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I did not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> much about the general public.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) on December 13th, where all my collections were under the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of Henslow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Journal had been written with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and my chief labour was making an abstract of my more interesting scientific results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of his chief <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics was his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the interest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to him my views on coral reefs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During this time I saw also a good deal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his breakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of curious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related to minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful examination of living reefs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will give my impressions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His mind was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, as it appeared to me, by clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> all possible objections to my suggestion, and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A second <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic was his hearty <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the work of other scientific men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This I did, and believe now that it was the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I felt a high <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> for Sir J.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He told me that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to each, of the facts which he thought might prove <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to him, and that he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his memory was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I asked him how at first he could judge what facts would be <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, and he answered that he did not know, but that a sort of instinct guided him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether his pictures of men were true ones is another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s on the minds of men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man well fitted to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He thought it a most ridiculous thing that any one should <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little slower, or moved at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many of the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter discovery has at last been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to attribute the whole account to my fertile <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During the voyage of the "Beagle" I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by the South American <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to be very ancient in a geological sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I worked on true Baconian principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale, more especially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to domesticated productions, by printed enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by extensive reading.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as they become modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d very little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace; and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Within late years several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s more correctly than I did.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sprengel's <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' For some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With Lythrum we have the still more <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful case of three forms standing in a similar relation to one another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An unverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if anyone should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, as an astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and rendered intelligible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to have paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to his origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this time forward I occasionally attended to the subject, both with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to man and our domesticated animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation' was published in the autumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe, the endless and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful contrivances for the transportal of pollen from one plant to another of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus Darwin' published, and I added a sketch of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and habits from material in my possession.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank's <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, our 'Power of Movement in Plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r full.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have said that in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> my mind has changed during the last twenty or thirty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, novels which are works of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, though not of a very high order, have been for years a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relief and pleasure to me, and I often bless all novelists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed by my fellow naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From my early youth I have had the strongest desire to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> or explain whatever I observed,--that is, to group all facts under some general laws.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is advisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few men, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment or observations, which would have proved directly or indirectly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author from several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a full complement of seed, although the parent plants had been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully protected from the access of insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The account was published in a most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able Journal, that of the Royal Society of Belgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why, except that there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding animals made me think this very improbable.</li>
