<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>First then let us lay down how many <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s we have to consider.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 2 At the beginning of the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> we must postulate the principles we are accustomed constantly to use for our scientific investigation of nature, that is we must take for granted principles of this universal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which appear in all Nature's work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Part 3 After these preliminaries, we go on to the next <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For animals which make the aforesaid change (of place) by the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of organized parts (I mean feet for example, or wings or similar organs) have the left and right distinguished in greater detail, while those which are not differentiated into such parts, but make the differentiation in the body itself and so progress, like some footless animals (for example snakes and caterpillars after their kind, and besides what men call earth-worms), all these have the distinction spoken of, although it is not made so manifest to us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now there is in place a superior, an intermediate, and an inferior; in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to place bipeds have their superior part corresponding to the part of the universe; quadrupeds, polypods, and footless animals to the intermediate part, and plants to the inferior.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Clearly then if any of the opposite pairs of parts (right and left, that is, superior and inferior, before and behind) have a movement of their own, each of them has for common original of its movements the juncture of the parts in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Among land animals this is the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the movement of snakes, and among water animals of eels, and conger-eels and also lampreys, in fact of all that have their form snakelike.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 8 The reason why snakes are limbless is first that nature makes nothing without purpose, but always <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s what is the best possible for each individual, preserving the peculiar essence of each and its intended <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and secondly the principle we laid down above that no Sanguineous creature can move itself at more than four points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so nothing can walk on three limbs or on one; in the latter case it has no support at all on which to rest the body's weight, in the former only in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of one pair of opposites, and so it must necessarily fall in endeavouring so to move.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A walking creature <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s from each of its members alternately, for in this way it recovers the same figure that it had at first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When then one leg is <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d it becomes the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For if one leg is at right angles to the ground and the other is <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, the latter will be at once equal and greater.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so flying insects, and birds (Schizoptera) whose tails are ill-adapted for the use in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, for example peacocks, and domestic cocks, and generally birds that hardly fly, cannot steer a straight course.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The flight of insects is slow and frail because the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their feathery wings is not proportionate to the bulk of their body; this is heavy, their wings small and frail, and so the flight they use is like a cargo boat attempting to make its voyage with oars; now the frailty both of the actual wings and of the outgrowths upon them contributes in a measure to the flight described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But birds are in general at the opposite pole to flying insects as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s their feathers, but especially the swiftest flyers among them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 11 So much then for these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also evident from these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s that a bird cannot possibly be erect in the sense in which man is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reason that they bend forward is the same as in the case of man, for in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they are like mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And plainly the lower limbs are opposed in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the upper, because the first joints are opposites, the shoulder bending forwards, the hip backwards; wherefore also the ankle bends backwards, and the wrist of the hand forwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If now we survey generally birds and winged insects, and animals which swim in a watery medium, all I mean that make their progress in water by dint of organs of movement, it is not difficult to see that it is better to have the attachment of the parts in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> oblique to the frame, exactly as in fact we see it to be both in birds and insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have given above the reason why its legs are not turned in under, that is the hardness and shell-like <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of its integument.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their legs are short, and being set back are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able for swimming.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It remains, after determining these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, to investigate the problems of Life and Death.</li>
