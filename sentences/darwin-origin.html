<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; and this cannot possibly be here done.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance which I have received from very many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under Domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms of life, and leads to what I have called Divergence of Character.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the four succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly, the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, Hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the Geological Record.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Causes of Variability--Effects of Habit--Correlation of Growth--Inheritance--Character of Domestic Varieties--Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and Species--Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species--Domestic Pigeons, their Differences and Origin--Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects--Methodical and Unconscious Selection--Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions--Circumstances favourable to Man's power of Selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment or modification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A long list could easily be given of "sporting plants;" by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from that of the rest of the plant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is well worth while <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why a peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in individuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to its grandfather or grandmother or other more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to their aboriginal stocks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There would be great difficulty in proving its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally {15} revert in some of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that is, to lose their acquired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, whilst kept under the same conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus arising shall be preserved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than in true species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Domestic races of the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; by which I mean, that, although differing {16} from each other, and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of generic value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ widely in determining what <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Horner's researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the Nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages, like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in Egypt? The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may, without here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to sheep and goats I can form no opinion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to horses, from reasons which I cannot give here, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races have descended from one {19} wild stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to ducks and rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure, I do not doubt that they have all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection of those individual mongrels, which present any desired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species, I can hardly believe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certainly, a breed intermediate between _two very distinct_ breeds could not be got without extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and long-continued selection; nor can I find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the domestic breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, seems very improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{25} Some facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the colouring of pigeons well deserve <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; for instance, I crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown and black birds; these I again crossed together, and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> derived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which has been lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed {27} species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very abnormal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in certain <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, as compared with all other Columbidæ, though so like in most other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s to the rock-pigeon; the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, I can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondly, although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these varieties, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thirdly, those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fourthly, pigeons have been watched, and tended with the utmost <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and loved by many people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;" and, continues the courtly historian, "His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d them astonishingly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The paramount importance of these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will be obvious when we treat of Selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could have descended from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of selection as "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his flock, but to change it altogether.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pigeons, that "he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; {32} all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely allied sub-breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see an astonishing <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With animals this {33} kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less as to allow his worst animals to breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, I cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries, {35} would <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful drawings of the breeds in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> had been made long ago, which might serve for comparison.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By a similar process of selection, and by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful training, the whole body of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights they carry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In plants the same gradual process of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether {37} or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful skill of gardeners, in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art, I cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> or modify most of our plants up to their present {38} standard of usefulness to man, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This, perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages have more of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can, I think, further <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the frequently abnormal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s for what is internal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which is dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that {40} most fleeting of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> than usual in matching his best animals and thus <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>s them, and the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When further <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilization of the inhabitants,--slowly to add to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic features of the breed, whatever they may be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply {41} sufficient, with extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this principle Marshall has remarked, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the sheep of parts of Yorkshire, that "as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly _in small lots_, they never can be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> enclosure of the land plays a part.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment and formation of new breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When in any country several domestic breeds have once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been greatly exaggerated, both in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an important part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> or dis<strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the species, and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter will be explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{47} Those forms which possess in some considerable degree the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of species, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the most important for us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good and true species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Practically, when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, he treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Watson, to whom I lie under deep obligation for <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the islets of the little Madeira group there are many insects which are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized as varieties in Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice? if that between America and Europe is ample, will that between the Continent and the Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or Ireland, be sufficient? It must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly-competent judges as varieties, have so perfectly the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of species that they are ranked by other highly-competent judges as good and true species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well deserve <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>; for several interesting lines of argument, from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These plants differ considerably in appearance; they have a different flavour, and emit a different odour; they flower at slightly different periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they ascend mountains to different heights; they have different geographical ranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during several years by {50} that most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer Gärtner, they can be crossed only with much difficulty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if his observations be widely extended, he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation,--and the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{53} Guided by theoretical <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, I thought that some interesting results might be obtained in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the nature and relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several well-worked floras.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as did subsequently Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker permits me to add, that after having <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the "struggle for existence," "divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>," and other <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, hereafter to be discussed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a different <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To test the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now Fries has remarked in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to plants, and Westwood in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of Divergence of Character, {58} we shall see how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, then, varieties have the same general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as species, for they cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the forms which they connect; and except, secondly by a certain amount of {59} difference, for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all these several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> these analogies, if species have once existed as varieties, and have thus originated: whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s us but little in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how species arise in nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most {61} plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>st parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than W.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nothing is easier than to admit in words the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s always in mind--never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of {67} its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This subject has been ably treated by several authors, and I shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at considerable length, more especially in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the feral animals of South America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life! I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have, also, reason to believe that <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From experiments which I have lately tried, I have found that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; but <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees alone visit the red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence I have very little doubt, that if the {74} whole genus of <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The number of <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newman, who has long attended to the habits of <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees, believes that "more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newman says, "Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this case we can clearly see that if we wished in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> to give the plant the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is good thus to try in our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> to give any form some advantage over another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Natural Selection--its power compared with man's selection--its power on <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of trifling importance--its power at all ages and on both sexes--Sexual Selection--On the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species--Circumstances favourable and unfavourable to Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals--Slow action--Extinction caused by Natural Selection--Divergence of Character, related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation--Action of Natural Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the descendants from a common parent--Explains the Grouping of all organic beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to variation? Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? I think we shall see that it can act most effectually.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall best <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In such case, every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of {83} them could anyhow be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not Nature effect? Man can act only on external and visible <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s: Nature <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Can we <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, then, that Nature's productions should be far "truer" in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being, yet <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and structures, which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the most trifling importance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It has been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> in the act of hatching.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> his breed by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection of the best cocks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I strongly suspect that some well-known laws, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the fleetness of his greyhounds by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and methodical selection, or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying {91} to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an individual so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised would be able to obtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red {95} clover, which is visited by <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, again, if <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus I can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I must trust to some general <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other view are inexplicable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this remarkable fact, which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising element; for we know of no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s and from the many special facts which I have collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am strongly inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d in a corresponding degree with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If there exist organic beings which never intercross, uniformity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> can be retained amongst them, as long as their conditions of life remain the same, only through the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification, uniformity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> can be given to their modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently competition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we turn to nature to test the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of these remarks, and look at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total number of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic,--that is, have been produced there, and nowhere else.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species {106} there supported, but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these many species become modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, others will have to be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas probably have been in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s highly favourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species, and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can, perhaps, on these views, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger Europæo-Asiatic area.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, by renewed elevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there will again be severe competition: the most favoured or <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties will be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> still further the inhabitants, and thus produce new species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d within any given period, and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s I think it inevitably follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, will naturally suffer most.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions, through the selection of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms by man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" _Divergence of Character.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the differences slowly become greater, the inferior animals with intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, being neither very swift nor very strong, will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here, then, we see in man's productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> both from each other and from their common parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural circumstances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now let us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction, will tend to act.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The accompanying diagram will aid us in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing this rather perplexing subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> comes in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the varieties or modified descendants, proceeding from the common parent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from (A).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The modified offspring from the later and more highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the same way, for instance, the English race-horse and English pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from their original stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced three forms, a^{10}, f^{10}, and m^{10}, which, from having diverged in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In each genus, the species, which are already extremely different in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d state of a species, as well as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become extinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by later and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d lines of descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between species a^{14} and z^{14} will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The intermediate species, also (and this is a very important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>), which connected the original species (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct, and have left no descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the new species F^{14}, which is supposed not to have diverged much in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having descended from a form which stood between the two parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between the two groups descended from these species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as these two groups have gone on diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the type of their parents, the new species (F^{14}) will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall, when we come to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this subject, and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the same orders, or families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often, in some degree, intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between existing groups; and we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this fact, for {125} the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I); and as these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and from inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three genera descended from (A), the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One large group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Within the same large {126} group, the later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d sub-groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification, but I may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection; and it leads to the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sexual selection will also give <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s useful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution, of which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot or to naturalised productions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and to much extinction of the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and intermediate forms of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact--the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming {129} sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the view that each species has been independently created, I can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings; but, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I believe this simile largely speaks the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Effects of external conditions--Use and disuse, combined with natural selection; organs of flight and of vision--Acclimatisation--Correlation of growth--Compensation and economy of growth--False correlations--Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures variable--Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable: specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s more variable than generic: secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s variable--Species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner--Reversions to long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s--Summary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have remarked in the first chapter--but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the remark--that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; and to {132} this system being functionally disturbed in the parents, I chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact of varieties of one species, when they range {133} into the zone of habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of such species, accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flight;--these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably with disuse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Far from feeling any surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to animals, several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is a very obscure <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d--for it is now as tender as ever it was--as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the Umbelliferæ these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can see, of the slightest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can thus only <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, are apt to be highly variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I infer also from an observation made by Professor Owen, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the length of the arms of the ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, when displayed in any unusual manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The term, secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, used by Hunter, applies to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rule applies to males and females; but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, it applies {151} more rarely to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, may be due to the great variability of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly attended to Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ extremely little even in different genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous amount of diversification: the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great, that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In our domestic animals, if any part, or the whole animal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It further deserves notice that these variable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, produced by man's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is notorious that specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are more variable than generic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists would <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>, namely, that specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are more variable than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement, that specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are more variable than generic; but I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that some _important_ organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has _differed_ considerably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been _variable_ in the individuals of some of the species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And this fact shows that a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Or to state the case in another manner:--the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus, are called generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in common I attribute to {156} inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species, fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been inherited from a remote period, since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus, are called specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and as these specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are very variable; I think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this proposition will be granted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The cause of the original variability of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s is not manifest; but we can see why these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been accumulated by sexual selection, which {157} is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, than in other parts of their structure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same number of joints in the tarsi is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> generally common to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidæ, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly; and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the highest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, or those which distinguish species from species, than of generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, or those which the species possess in common;--that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species;--that the great variability of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and the great amount of difference in these same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s between closely allied species;--that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation,--are all principles closely connected together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{159} _Distinct species present analogous variations; and a variety of one species often assumes some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of an allied species, or reverts to some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of an early progenitor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feet,--<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all these marks are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt it is a very surprising fact that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s should reappear after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to the foreign breed for many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a breed which has not been crossed, but in which _both_ parents have lost some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations {161} distant, but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an ascendancy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some facts; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> being inherited for an endless number of generations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all know them to be, thus inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have descended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s another species; this other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the presence of all important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s will be governed by natural selection, in accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As, however, we never know the exact <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the common ancestor of a group, we could not distinguish these two {162} cases: if, for instance, we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion, from the number of the markings, which are correlated with the blue tint, and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, though under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an anciently existing <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (either from reversion or from analogous variation) which already occur in some other members of the same group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species; and this shows, unless all these forms be considered as independently created species, that the one in varying has assumed some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the same part or organ in an allied species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting any important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but from occurring in several species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of _all_ colours; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one instance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a trace in a {164} bay horse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My son made a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can implicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with _three_ short parallel stripes on each shoulder.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an {166} accident, that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, is--that there is a _tendency_ in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes prevails.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed; and there are very many other correlations of growth, the nature of which we are utterly unable to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rudimentary organs, from being useless, will be dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by natural selection, and hence probably are variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s--that is, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent--are more variable than generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed within this same period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are highly variable, and such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s differ much in the species of the same group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when a species with any extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of many modified descendants--which on my view must be a very slow process, requiring a long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of their ancient progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads:--Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined? Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of {172} such <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the inimitable perfection? Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection? What shall we say to so <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells, which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians? Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed, their fertility is unimpaired? The two first heads shall be here discussed--Instinct and Hybridism in separate chapters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d parent or other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? It will be much more convenient to discuss this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting {173} profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If I am right in believing that allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, {176} the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> adapt a varying species to a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then, I think, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;--why as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But a far more important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, as I believe, is that, during the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists {177} in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> their stocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill-variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be further <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d through natural selection and gain further advantages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> would have been far more difficult, and I could have given no answer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let the climate and vegetation change, let other competing {181} rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also became modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d in structure in a corresponding manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, can hardly be considered real.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His reason ought to conquer his <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>; though I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing {189} slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers; and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully selecting each alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a distincter image.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting description of these parts, <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this remark is indeed shown by that old but somewhat exaggerated canon in natural history of "Natura non facit saltum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" We meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so? Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so commonly linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why she should not; for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a leap, but must <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> by the shortest and slowest steps.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--As natural selection acts by life and death,--by the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structure,--I have sometimes felt much difficulty in {195} <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the origin of simple parts, of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the first place, we are much too ignorant in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the whole economy of any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a former chapter I have given instances of most trifling <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh, which, from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are really of very little importance, and which have originated from quite secondary causes, independently of natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, probably have some little direct influence on the organisation; that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s reappear from the law of reversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures; and finally, that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of animals having a will, to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection; as it is, I have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to sexual selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation; and I have here alluded to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause {199} of the slight analogous differences between species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But by far the most important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera? If we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many members of the same great order, and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death of some few members.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we admire the truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the community for any other end, and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her instantly to destroy the {203} young queens her daughters as soon as born, or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful metamorphoses in function are at least possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the theory of natural selection we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, "Natura non facit saltum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters; but I have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject separately, especially as so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful an instinct as that of the hive-bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term; but every one <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s what is meant, when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds' nests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{208} But I could show that none of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of instinct are universal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at all, he might truly be said to have done so instinctively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It can be clearly shown that the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instincts have originated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the general <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of individuals of the same species, born in a state of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude of facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall thus also be enabled to see the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive parts which habit and the selection of {213} so-called accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and tastes, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when different breeds of dogs are {214} crossed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the first tendency to point was once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the {215} work; and unconscious selection is still at work, as each man tries to procure, without intending to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breed, dogs which will stand and hunt best.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall, perhaps, best <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection, by considering a few cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will select only three, out of the several which I shall have to discuss in my future work,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the comb-making power of the hive-bee; these two latter instincts have generally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful of all known instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the old bird profited by this occasional habit, or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird, than by their own mother's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time; then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gray and to some other observers, the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for her own offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So utterly <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with their larvae and pupæ to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful an instinct could have been perfected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>sanguinea from one nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully carrying (instead of being carried by, as in the case of F.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instinct of making slaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Both in Switzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the larvæ, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that the masters in this country receive much less <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At one end of a short series we have <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully described and figured by Pierre Huber.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, this bee would make a structure as <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully perfect as that of the hive-bee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have further to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer, she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey; in the same way as the rude <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By such {228} modifications of instincts in themselves not very <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful,--hardly more <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful than those which guide a bird to make its nest,--I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these flat bottoms, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax, perceiving when they have gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d the wax away to the proper thinness, and then stopping their work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d away on both sides.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement, on the summit of the ridge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seems at first to add to the difficulty of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as Huber has stated, {232} a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d, the planes of intersection between these spheres.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bee, if she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax would be saved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, as I believe, the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful of all known instincts, that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural selection having by slow degrees, more and more perfectly, led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As far as instinct alone is concerned, the prodigious difference in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> between the workers and the perfect females, would have been far better exemplified by the hive-bee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal {237} in the ordinary state, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure, this being inherited by its offspring, which again varied and were again selected, and so onwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence I can see no real difficulty in any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not doubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could be slowly formed by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts extraordinarily {239} different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste alone carry a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard or imprison.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful and well-established facts at once annihilate my theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have been rendered by natural selection, as I believe to be quite possible, different from the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that each successive, slight, profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest, but in a few alone; and that by the long-continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification, all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this view we ought occasionally to find neuter-insects of the same species, in the same nest, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find, even often, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes differed <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, as I believe, the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each other and from {242} their parents, has originated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am surprised that no one has <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of Lamarck.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly the same instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of South America lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush: how it is that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build "cock-nests," to roost in, like the males of our distinct Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of {244} any other known bird.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the larvae of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in these and in many other cases, Gärtner is obliged <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to count the seeds, in order to show that there is any degree of sterility.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely, Kölreuter and Gärtner, should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the very same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also most instructive to compare--but I have not space here to enter on details--the evidence <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by our best botanists on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author, from experiments made during different years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though Gärtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased, but generally greatly decreased.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful an observer as Gärtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with a pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other species, yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with scientific <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, deserve some notice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to animals, much fewer experiments have been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully tried than with plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter alternative seems to me the most probable, and I am inclined to believe in its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, although it rests on no direct evidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge is in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of difference in any recognisable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is sufficient to prevent two species crossing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are certain hybrids which instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between their two parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed, the case is {265} very different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must, however, be confessed that we cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, excepting on vague hypotheses, several facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the sterility of hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All that I have attempted to show, is that in two cases, in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s allied, sterility is the common result,--in the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, and this seems to me by far the most important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by man's methodical and unconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither wishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive system, or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from man selecting only {272} external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system; from these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s and facts, I do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which I have taken with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--Independently of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of fertility, the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> could be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follows according to Gärtner the same laws.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when, one variety is crossed with {275} another variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have been slowly acquired by selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ much or little from each other, namely in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Laying aside the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of fertility and sterility, {276} in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that the two most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and not of differences in the reproductive system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, excluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s from all its modified descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic features of these two breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing their origin, it would not have been possible to have {281} determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms of life tend to supplant the old and un<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may at least confidently believe that no rocky coast 500 feet in height commonly yields at the rate of a foot per century; for this would be the same in amount as a cliff one yard in height retreating twelve yards in twenty-two years; and no one, I think, who has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed the shape of old fallen fragments at the base of cliffs, will admit any near approach to such rapid wearing away.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the terrestrial productions which lived during the Secondary and Palæozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to mammiferous remains, a single glance at the historical table published in the Supplement to Lyell's Manual, will bring home the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, how accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I feel much confidence in the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of these views, for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by Sir C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the foregoing <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s it cannot be doubted that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, I can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived; but I can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One other <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is worth notice: with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties; and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place, but if possessed {302} of any decided advantage, or when further modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If then, there be some degree of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in these remarks, we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We continually forget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our geological formations have been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and of the United States.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these and similar <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic {307} beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they do not present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in any degree intermediate between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{308} To the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the difficulty of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can perhaps <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on the principle of competition, and on that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form which does not become in some degree modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, {315} will be liable to be exterminated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why a species when once lost should never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from their distinct progenitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d offspring, it is quite {316} incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>; and the rule strictly accords with my theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms are intimately connected together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully sudden.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one I think can have <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>led more at the extinction of species, than I have done.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I may repeat what I published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to feel no surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{321} Hence the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest allies of that species, _i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class, which yield their places to other species which have been modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped severe competition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palæozoic period and of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time {322} between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We need not <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> at extinction; if we must <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of each species depends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any information in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to their geological position, no one would have suspected that they had co-existed with still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters co-existed with the {324} Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary stages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore as new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d groups spread throughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the extinct forms of life <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be disputed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Vertebrata, whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist, Owen, showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority could not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that Palaeozoic animals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s between two living forms, the objection is probably valid.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most common case, especially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s groups now widely separated from each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and {331} Batrachians, the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the more recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is some <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in the remark.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must not, however, assume that divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of {332} life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, has become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet he who objected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living genera of three families together, intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, would be justified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, for instance, we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each {333} other by a dozen <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, in this case the genera, at the early period marked VI.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, would differ by a lesser number of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the common progenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between their modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All that we have a right to expect, is that those groups, which have within known geological periods undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s than do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palæontologists seems frequently to be the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between that which preceded and that which succeeded it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the {334} diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between the forms of life above and below.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, between the preceding and succeeding faunas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palæontologists as intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between those of the overlying carboniferous, and underlying Silurian system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is no real objection to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the statement, that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The species extreme in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, intermediate in age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To compare small things with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and still less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this same <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, is the fact, insisted on by all palæontologists, that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not doubt that this process of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but I can see no way of testing this sort of progress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking that the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this doctrine is very far from proved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at least in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered--a discovery of which the chance is very small.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This relationship is even more clearly seen in the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful collection of fossil bones made by MM.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this "law of the succession of types,"--on "this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>North America formerly partook strongly of the present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in the caves of Brazil, there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to the species still living in South America; and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>; that {342} only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species; and that varieties have at first often been local.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer this latter <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the Silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which are those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together one grand system; for all are connected by generation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, from the continued tendency to divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it displays <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since {345} become widely divergent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for the forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, all the chief laws of palæontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms of life, produced by the laws of variation still acting round us, and preserved by Natural Selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most diversified conditions; the most humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under almost every temperature.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment; and thus they will become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, {351} and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are thus brought to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth's surface.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty, in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now found.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by general <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, that each species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that a region, of which {355} most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region, whence it has been stocked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view of the relation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ much (by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in an ingenious paper by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The previous remarks on "single and multiple centres of creation" do not directly bear on another allied <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>,--namely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With those organic beings which never intercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have descended from a succession of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties, which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so that, at each {356} successive stage of modification and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To illustrate what I mean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several facts in distribution,--such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain degree of relation (as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessitated on the view <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by Forbes and admitted by his many followers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Watson) from the somewhat northern <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the flora in comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds, during the Glacial epoch.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering that the several above means of transport, and that several other means, which without {364} doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years, it would I think be a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and th<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d ground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus also <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the fact that the Alpine plants of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will generally {368} have been due south and north.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree warmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States believe to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil Gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their present homes; but I have met with no satisfactory evidence with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since the Glacial period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this view we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the relationship, with very little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe,--a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can further <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the singular fact remarked on by several observers, that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their inhabitants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, I think, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America; and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine animals, in the Mediterranean and in the seas of Japan,--areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So on the Silla of Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Cordillera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the plants of that large island.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dana, that "it is certainly a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its Crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to America, and by Alph.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>de Candolle in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Australia, that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will only say that as far as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia, I believe that towards the close of the Glacial period, icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, have been largely concerned in their dispersal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to {384} fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the second place, salt-water fish can with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and {385} subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I could not even <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d age they would voluntarily drop off.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nature, like a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This view would remove many difficulties, but it would not, I think, explain all the facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to insular productions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which bear on the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even the uniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s is not quite fair.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the effects of this intercrossing, {391} it should be remembered that the offspring of such crosses would almost certainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional cross would produce more effect than might at first have been anticipated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Madeira, again, is inhabited by a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its shores: now, though we do not know how sea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to se<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>ed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported far more easily than {392} land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of open sea.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many remarkable little facts could be given with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the inhabitants of remote islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully searched the oldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not found a single {394} instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> can easily be answered; for no {395} terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position, and we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the absence of all terrestrial mammals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on this head in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the great Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival, could have reached their present homes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould has given several interesting cases in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the land-shells of the islands of the Pacific.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As this species has a thick cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous operculum, I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it recovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{398} The most striking and important fact for us in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why should this be so? why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I have elsewhere shown, in a quite <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous manner, by very closely related species; so that the inhabitants of each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> throughout the group, just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s I think we need not greatly <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> at the endemic and representative species, which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, not having universally spread from island to island.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The principle which determines the general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not identically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,--the colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes,--is of the widest application throughout nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, also, some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>de Candolle in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to plants, namely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all {407} the changes of climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period; if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the many and curious means of occasional transport,--a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts, I think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the same parents, are not insuperable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by some general <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of sub-genera, genera, and families.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my theory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration, I do not think that the difficulties are insuperable; though they often are in this case, and in that of the individuals of the same species, extremely great.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On these same principles, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of migration, one group of beings, even within the same class, should have all its species endemic, and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Groups of species, belonging either to a certain period of time, or to a certain area, are often <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by trifling <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in common, as of sculpture or colour.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency in their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to diverge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, to supplant and exterminate the less divergent, the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, and preceding forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But what is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions,--that is, by one sentence to give the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such expressions as that famous one of Linnæus, and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form, that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s do not make the genus, but that the genus gives the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, seem to imply that something more is included in our classification, than mere resemblance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely "adaptive or analogical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s;" but to the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of these resemblances we shall have to recur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, "The generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, I have always <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as affording very clear indications of its true affinities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any one of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s singly is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Numerous instances could be given of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are universally admitted as highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in the definition of whole groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the angle of the jaws in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of insects are folded--mere colour in certain Algæ--mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would, I think, have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to {417} birds and reptiles, as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The importance, for classification, of trifling <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, mainly depends on their being correlated with several other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of more or less importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The value indeed of an aggregate of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s is very evident in natural history.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, also, it has been found, that a classification founded on any single <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is universally constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The importance of an aggregate of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, even when none are important, alone explains, I think, that saying of Linnæus, that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s do not give the genus, but the genus gives the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>de Jussieu has remarked, "the greater number of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the species, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" But when Aspicarpa produced in France, during several years, only degraded flowers, departing so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order, yet M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Practically when naturalists are at work, they do {418} not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which they use in defining a group, or in allocating any particular species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If they find a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for propelling the blood, or for aërating it, or those for propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in classification; but in some groups of animals all these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of quite subordinate value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can see why <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of course include all ages of each species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are the most important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same fact holds good with flowering plants, of which the two main divisions have been founded on <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from the embryo,--on the number and position of the {419} embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In our discussion on embryology, we shall see why such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nothing can be easier than to define a number of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s common to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has hitherto been found impossible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the Articulata.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the comparative value of the various groups of species, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{420} All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reader will best <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what is meant, if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position; for F originally was intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between A and I, and the several genera descended from these two genera will {422} have inherited to a certain extent their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>; whereas with sheep the horns are much less <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, because less constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In tumbler pigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others {424} in the important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If it could be proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour and other important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from negroes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, or that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, is known to every naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams of separating them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{425} As descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvæ are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? I believe it has thus been unconsciously used; and only thus can I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore we choose those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which, as far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> not how trifling a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its inheritance from a common parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may err in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to single points of structure, but when several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, let them be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have been inherited from a common ancestor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{426} And we know that such correlated or aggregated <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have especial value in classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why a species or a group of species may depart, in several of its most important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics, from its allies, and yet be safely classed with them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This may be safely done, and is often done, as long as a sufficient number of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, let them be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let two forms have not a single <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in common, yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same class.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see why embryological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are of such high classificatory importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on these views, the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On my view of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s being of real importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why analogical or adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can also <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the apparent paradox, that the very same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to inhabit for instance {428} the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can perhaps <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore we must suppose either that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very ancient Marsupial, which will have had a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in some degree intermediate with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all existing Marsupials; or {430} that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of its ancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their common progenitor, or of an early member of the group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the species descended from a common parent, together with their retention by inheritance of some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in common, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the common parent of a whole family of species, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred {431} of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There has been still less in some other classes, as in that of the Crustacea, for here the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully diverse forms are still tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We could not, as I have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the many descendants from one dominant parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages, although having few <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in common, {433} under one species; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their parent; and I believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct group, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and yet use these same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s within the limits of the same group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the same law in comparing the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex {437} mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic (as Owen has observed) of all low or little-modified forms; therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebræ; the unknown progenitor of the articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many spiral whorls of leaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps, we need not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> at discovering in such parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained by the strong principle of inheritance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part, as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On my view these terms may be used literally; and the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, which they would probably have retained through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the w<strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of the lion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one will suppose that the stripes on the w<strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, {440} are of any use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er is active, and has to provide for itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups, the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the {442} adult: thus Owen has remarked in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to cuttle-fish, "there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed;" and again in spiders, "there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is not, at what period of life any variation has been caused, but at what period it is fully displayed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant whether most of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These two principles, if their <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> be admitted, will, I believe, explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly {445} caused by selection under domestication; but having had <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic breeds of Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic points of difference--for instance, that of the width of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences which give value to each breed, and which have been accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies: firstly, from the young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage {448} of development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar habits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this view we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together! The meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for instance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same species) resembling each other most closely in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, one of which will have full-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of membrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the {451} rudiments represent wings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The wing of the penguin is of high <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and acts as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wings of birds; not that I believe this to be the case, it is more probably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx is useless, and is truly rudimentary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development {453} and in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have now given the leading facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to rudimentary organs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature? An eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus act? Can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed, can be of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? When a man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo, and their lesser relative size in the adult.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited--we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications; the value set upon <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, if constant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most trifling {457} importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance; the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied, together with their modification through natural selection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we extend the use of this element of descent,--the only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings,--we shall <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what is meant by the natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited at a corresponding period, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the great leading facts in Embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts, which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function; and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or {458} organs, though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The importance of embryological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That many and serious objections may be <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection, I do not deny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,--that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its kind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree, variable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together; but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two species are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover _directly_ connecting {463} links between them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the intermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will generally be modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate varieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can answer these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and {465} <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; and when they do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest Silurian strata, I can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth chapter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is certain that he can largely influence the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That many of the breeds produced by man have to a large extent the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the individuals of the same species come in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of the same genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man, though acting on external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s alone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one admits that there are at least individual differences in species under {469} nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this same {470} view we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, the species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they are clustered in little groups round other species--in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s they resemble varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of species of the same genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>New and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dominant species belonging to the {471} larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at the same time more divergent in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around us, and which has prevailed throughout all time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor ought we to <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We need not <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> at the sting of the bee causing the bee's own death; at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act, with the great majority slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both cases physical conditions seem to have produced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone, they occasionally assume some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the species proper to that zone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both varieties and species reversions to long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s occur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon! On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should the specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species, supposed to have been created independently, have differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have become in a high degree permanent, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this fact; for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other; {474} and therefore these same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would be more likely still to be variable than the generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have been inherited without change for an enormous period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Glancing at instincts, <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous as some are, they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can thus <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions of life, {475} yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need not <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on the principle of natural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between the {476} fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, the progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in comparison with its later descendants; and thus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between existing and allied groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Recent forms are generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient and extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms have conquered the older and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d organic beings in the struggle for life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in Distribution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see the full meaning of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see why certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are far more <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able than others for classification;--why adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, though of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any {479} importance in classification; why <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from rudimentary parts, though of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the being, are often of high classificatory value; and why embryological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are the most valuable of all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, however slight their vital importance may be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may cease <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiæ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions {480} of life; and we can clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have now recapitulated the chief facts and <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s which have thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long course of descent, by the preservation or the natural selection of many successive slight favourable variations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although I am fully convinced of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the views given in this volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any one whose <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> with <strong style='color: red'>impartial</strong>ity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They admit that a multitude of forms, which till lately {483} they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have every external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic feature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away in force.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the views <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by me in this volume, and by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter point will become a far more essential <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> than it is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, without rejecting the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The terms used by naturalists of affinity, relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, rudimentary and aborted organs, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become! A grand and almost untrodden field of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> will be opened, on the causes and laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We possess no {487} pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of any kind which have long been inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the nature of long-lost structures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of one being entailing the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment or the extermination of others; it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful have been, and are being, evolved.</li>
