<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Ethics he has described the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> necessary for the good life, but that life is for him essentially to be lived in society, and when in the last chapters of the Ethics he comes to the practical application of his inquiries, that finds expression not in moral exhortations addressed to the individual but in a description of the legislative opportunities of the statesman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aristotle has none of the high enthusiasm or poetic <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> of Plato.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His ideal is constructed not of pure reason or poetry, but from <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and sympathetic study of a wide range of facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, though as a criticism it is curiously inept, reveals his own attitude admirably: "Let us remember that we should not dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the experience of ages; in the multitude of years, these things, if they were good, would certainly not have been unknown; for almost everything has been found out, although sometimes they are not put together; in other cases men do not use the knowledge which they have.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Aristotle in his Constitutions had made a study of one hundred and fifty-eight constitutions of the states of his day, and the fruits of that study are seen in the continual reference to concrete political experience, which makes the Politics in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s a critical history of the workings of the institutions of the Greek city state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ostensibly it is merely a continuation of the Ethics, but it comes to treat political <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s from a purely political standpoint.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This combination of idealism and <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for the teachings of experience constitutes in some ways the strength and value of the Politics, but it also makes it harder to follow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to an <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the Politics if something is said on those two points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a way of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further, the constitution within the framework of which the ordinary process of administration and passing of decrees went on, was always <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the work of a special man or body of men, the lawgivers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So Herodotus recounts that when the people of Cyrene asked the oracle of Delphi to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> them in their dissensions, the oracle told them to go to Mantinea, and the Mantineans lent them Demonax, who acted as a "setter straight" and drew up a new constitution for Cyrene.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again the Milesians, Herodotus tells us, were long troubled by civil discord, till they asked <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> from Paros, and the Parians sent ten commissioners who gave Miletus a new constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aristotle's Politics, then, is a handbook for the legislator, the expert who is to be called in when a state wants <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is one of the most marked <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of Greek political theory that Plato and Aristotle think of the statesman as one who has knowledge of what ought to be done, and can <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> those who call him in to prescribe for them, rather than one who has power to control the forces of society.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He assumes the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic Platonic view that all men seek the good, and go wrong through ignorance, not through evil will, and so he naturally <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the state as a community which exists for the sake of the good life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is in the state that that common seeking after the good which is the profoundest <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> about men and nature becomes explicit and knows itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The state is for Aristotle prior to the family and the village, although it succeeds them in time, for only when the state with its conscious organisation is reached can man <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the secret of his past struggles after something he knew not what.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence for Aristotle as for Plato, the natural state or the state as such is the ideal state, and the ideal state is the starting-point of political <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In accordance with the same line of thought, imperfect states, although called perversions, are <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by Aristotle as the result rather of misconception and ignorance than of perverse will.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They have come short of the perfect state through mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the end or through ignorance of the proper means to the end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Aristotle is right in seeing that political government demands equality, not in the sense that all members of the state should be equal in ability or should have equal power, but in the sense that none of them can properly be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed simply as tools with which the legislator works, that each has a right to say what will be made of his own life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Most political <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s are concerned with the construction and expression of the general will, and with attempts to ensure that the political machinery made to express the general will shall not be exploited for private or sectional ends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Aristotle's mixed constitution springs from a <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of sectional interests in the state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we come to Aristotle's analysis of existing constitutions, we find that while he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s them as imperfect approximations to the ideal, he also thinks of them as the result of the struggle between classes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But now this is not true, as will be evident to any one who will consider this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> in the most approved method.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As, in an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into every other subject, it is necessary to separate the different parts of which it is compounded, till we arrive at their first elements, which are the most minute parts thereof; so by the same proceeding we shall acquire a knowledge of the primary parts of a city and see wherein they differ from each other, and whether the rules of art will give us any <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance in examining into each of these things which are mentioned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And when many villages so entirely join themselves together as in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to form but one society, that society is a city, and contains in itself, if I may so speak, the end and perfection of government: first founded that we might live, but continued that we may live happily.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Such a one must naturally be of a quarrelsome <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and as solitary as the birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let these then be considered as the three distinct parts of a family: some think that the providing what is necessary for the family is something different from the government of it, others that this is the greatest part of it; it shall be considered separately; but we will first speak of a master and a slave, that we may both <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the nature of those things which are absolutely necessary, and also try if we can learn anything better on this subject than what is already known.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As in all arts which are brought to perfection it is necessary that they should have their proper instruments if they would complete their works, so is it in the art of managing a family: now of instruments some of them are alive, others inanimate; thus with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the pilot of the ship, the tiller is without life, the sailor is alive; for a servant is as an instrument in many arts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now life is itself what we use, and not what we employ as the efficient of something else; for which reason the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s of a slave are for use.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER V But whether any person is such by nature, and whether it is advantageous and just for any one to be a slave or no, or whether all slavery is contrary to nature, shall be considered hereafter; not that it is difficult to determine it upon general principles, or to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it from matters of fact; for that some should govern, and others be governed, is not only necessary but useful, and from the hour of their birth some are marked out for those purposes, and others for the other, and there are many species of both sorts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may then, as we affirm, perceive in an animal the first principles of herile and political government; for the soul governs the body as the master governs his slave; the mind governs the appetite with a political or a kingly power, which shows that it is both natural and advantageous that the body should be governed by the soul, and the pathetic part by the mind, and that part which is possessed of reason; but to have no ruling power, or an improper one, is hurtful to all; and this holds true not only of man, but of other animals also, for tame animals are naturally better than wild ones, and it is advantageous that both should be under subjection to man; for this is productive of their common safety: so is it naturally with the male and the female; the one is superior, the other inferior; the one governs, the other is governed; and the same rule must necessarily hold good with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He then is by nature formed a slave who is qualified to become the chattel of another person, and on that account is so, and who has just reason enough to know that there is such a faculty, without being indued with the use of it; for other animals have no perception of reason, but are entirely guided by appetite, and indeed they vary very little in their use from each other; for the advantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises from their bodily strength administering to our necessities; for it is the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen different from each other, that the one should be robust for their necessary purposes, the others erect, useless indeed for what slaves are employed in, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties of war and peace; though these rules do not always take place, for slaves have sometimes the bodies of freemen, sometimes the souls; if then it is evident that if some bodies are as much more excellent than others as the statues of the gods excel the human form, every one will allow that the inferior ought to be slaves to the superior; and if this is true with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the body, it is still juster to determine in the same manner, when we consider the soul; though it is not so easy to perceive the beauty of [1255a] the soul as it is of the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VI But it is not difficult to perceive that those who maintain the contrary opinion have some reason on their side; for a man may become a slave two different ways; for he may be so by law also, and this law is a certain compact, by which whatsoever is taken in battle is adjudged to be the property of the conquerors: but many persons who are conversant in law call in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> this pretended right, and say that it would be hard that a man should be compelled by violence to be the slave and subject of another who had the power to compel him, and was his superior in strength; and upon this subject, even of those who are wise, some think one way and some another; but the cause of this doubt and variety of opinions arises from hence, that great abilities, when accompanied with proper means, are generally able to succeed by force: for victory is always owing to a superiority in some advantageous circumstances; so that it seems that force never prevails but in consequence of great abilities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some persons, entirely resting upon the right which the law gives (for that which is legal is in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s just), insist upon it that slavery occasioned by war is just, not that they say it is wholly so, for it may happen that the principle upon which the wars were commenced is unjust; moreover no one will say that a man who is unworthily in slavery is therefore a slave; for if so, men of the noblest families might happen to be slaves, and the descendants of slaves, if they should chance to be taken prisoners in war and sold: to avoid this difficulty they say that such persons should not be called slaves, but barbarians only should; but when they say this, they do nothing more than inquire who is a slave by nature, which was what we at first said; for we must acknowledge that there are some persons who, wherever they are, must necessarily be slaves, but others in no situation; thus also it is with those of noble descent: it is not only in their own country that they are Esteemed as such, but everywhere, but the barbarians are <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed on this account at home only; as if nobility and freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other not so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The master is not so called from his knowing how to manage his slave, but because he is so; for the same reason a slave and a freeman have their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive appellations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is also one sort of knowledge proper for a master, another for a slave; the slave's is of the nature of that which was taught by a slave at Syracuse; for he for a stipulated sum instructed the boys in all the business of a household slave, of which there are various sorts to be learnt, as the art of cookery, and other such-like <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, of which some are allotted to some, and others to others; some employments being more honourable, others more necessary; according to the proverb, "One slave excels another, one master excels another:" in such-like things the knowledge of a slave consists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The knowledge of the master is to be able properly to employ his slaves, for the mastership of slaves is the employment, not the mere possession of them; not that this knowledge contains anything great or <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able; for what a slave ought to know how to do, that a master ought to know how to order; for which reason, those who have it in their power to be free from these low attentions, employ a steward for this business, and apply themselves either to public affairs or philosophy: the knowledge of procuring what is necessary for a family is different from that which belongs either to the master or the slave: and to do this justly must be either by war or hunting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the first place then, some one may doubt whether the getting of money is the same thing as economy, or whether it is a part of it, or something subservient to it; and if so, whether it is as the art of making shuttles is to the art of weaving, or the art of making brass to that of statue founding, for they are not of the same <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; for the one supplies the tools, the other the matter: by the matter I mean the subject out of which the work is finished, as wool for the cloth and brass for the statue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Others live exercising violence over living creatures, one pursuing this thing, another that, these preying upon men; those who live near lakes and marshes and rivers, or the sea itself, on fishing, while others are fowlers, or hunters of wild beasts; but the greater part of mankind live upon the produce of the earth and its cultivated fruits; and the manner in which all those live who follow the direction of nature, and labour for their own subsistence, is nearly the same, without ever thinking to procure any provision by way of exchange or merchandise, such are shepherds, husband-men, [1256b] robbers, fishermen, and hunters: some join different employments together, and thus live very agreeably; supplying those deficiencies which were wanting to make their subsistence depend upon themselves only: thus, for instance, the same person shall be a shepherd and a robber, or a husbandman and a hunter; and so with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the rest, they pursue that mode of life which necessity points out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For which reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly conversant about trade, and the business of it to be able to tell where the greatest profits can be made, being the means of procuring abundance of wealth and possessions: and thus wealth is very often supposed to consist in the quantity of money which any one possesses, as this is the medium by which all trade is conducted and a fortune made, others again <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> it as of no value, as being of none by nature, but arbitrarily made so by compact; so that if those who use it should alter their sentiments, it would be worth nothing, as being of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> for any necessary purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus also there are no limits to the art of medicine, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the health which it attempts to procure; the same also is true of all other arts; no line can be drawn to terminate their bounds, the several professors of them being desirous to extend them as far as possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Thus in the art of acquiring riches there are no limits, for the object of that is money and possessions; but economy has a boundary, though this has not: for acquiring riches is not the business of that, for which reason it should seem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see the contrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches add to their money without end; the cause of which is the near connection of these two arts with each other, which sometimes occasions the one to change employments with the other, as getting of money is their common object: for economy requires the possession of wealth, but not on its own account but with another view, to purchase things necessary therewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that some persons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper object of economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved and hoarded up without end; the reason for which <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> is, that they are intent upon living, but not upon living well; and this desire being boundless in its extent, the means which they aim at for that purpose are boundless also; and those who propose to live well, often confine that to the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense; so that as this also seems to depend upon what a man has, all their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is to get money, and hence arises the other cause for this art; for as this enjoyment is excessive in its degree, they endeavour to procure means proportionate to supply it; and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing in money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their powers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER X We have now determined what was before doubtful, whether or no the art of getting money is his business who is at the head of a family or a state, and though not strictly so, it is however very necessary; for as a politician does not make men, but receiving them from the hand of nature employs them to proper purposes; thus the earth, or the sea, or something else ought to supply them with provisions, and this it is the business of the master of the family to manage properly; for it is not the weaver's business to make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguish what is good and useful from what is bad and of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; and indeed some one may inquire why getting money should be a part of economy when the art of healing is not, as it is as requisite that the family should be in health as that they should eat, or have anything else which is necessary; and as it is indeed in some particulars the business both of the master of the family, and he to whom the government of the state is entrusted, to see after the health of those under their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, but in others not, but the physician's; so also as to money; in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it is the business of the master of the family, in others not, but of the servant; but as we have already said, it is chiefly nature's, for it is her part to supply her offspring with food; for everything finds nourishment left for it in what produced it; for which reason the natural riches of all men arise from fruits and animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now money-making, as we say, being twofold, it may be applied to two purposes, the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> of the house or retail trade; of which the first is necessary and commendable, the other justly censurable; for it has not its origin in [1258b] nature, but by it men gain from each other; for usury is most reasonably detested, as it is increasing our fortune by money itself, and not employing it for the purpose it was originally intended, namely exchange.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Agriculture also should be understood, and the management of arable grounds and orchards; and also the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of bees, and fish, and birds, from whence any profit may arise; these are the first and most proper parts of domestic management.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to gaining money by exchange, the principal method of doing this is by merchandise, which is carried on in three different ways, either by sending the commodity for sale by sea or by land, or else selling it on the place where it grows; and these differ from each other in this, that the one is more profitable, the other safer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There was a certain person in Sicily who laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hand in buying up all the iron from the iron merchants; so that when the dealers came from the markets to purchase, there was no one had any to sell but himself; and though he put no great <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> upon it, yet by laying out fifty talents he made an hundred.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This man's view and Thales's was exactly the same; both of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves: it is useful also for politicians to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> these things, for many states want to raise money and by such means, as well as private families, nay more so; for which reason some persons who are employed in the management of public affairs confine themselves to this province only.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XIII It is evident then that in the due government of a family, greater attention should be paid to the several members of it and their virtues than to the possessions or riches of it; and greater to the freemen than the slaves: but here some one may doubt whether there is any other virtue in a slave than his organic <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, and of higher estimation than these, as temperance, fortitude, justice, and such-like habits, or whether they possess only bodily qualities: each side of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> has its difficulties; for if they possess these virtues, wherein do they differ from freemen? and that they do not, since they are men, and partakers of reason, is absurd.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nearly the same <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> may be made concerning a woman and a child, whether these also have their proper virtues; whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, and whether a child is temperate or no; and indeed this <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> ought to be general, whether the virtues of those who, by nature, either govern or are governed, are the same or different; for if it is necessary that both of them should partake of the fair and good, why is it also necessary that, without exception, the one should govern, the other always be governed? for this cannot arise from their possessing these qualities in different degrees; for to govern, and to be governed, are things different in species, but more or less are not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And yet it is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that one party ought to have them, and the other not; for if he who is to govern should not be temperate and just, how can he govern well? or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well? for he who is intemperate [1260a] and a coward will never do what he ought: it is evident then that both parties ought to be virtuous; but there is a difference between them, as there is between those who by nature command and who by nature obey, and this originates in the soul; for in this nature has planted the governing and submitting principle, the virtues of which we say are different, as are those of a rational and an irrational being.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus also must it necessarily be with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to moral virtues; all must be supposed to possess them, but not in the same manner, but as is best suited to every one's employment; on which account he who is to govern ought to be perfect in moral virtue, for his business is entirely that of an architect, and reason is the architect; while others want only that portion of it which may be sufficient for their station; from whence it is evident, that although moral virtue is common to all those we have spoken of, yet the temperance of a man and a woman are not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, though Socrates thought otherwise; for the courage of the man consists in commanding, the woman's in obeying; and the same is true in other particulars: and this will be evident to those who will examine different virtues separately; for those who use general terms deceive themselves when they say, that virtue consists in a good <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of mind, or doing what is right, or something of this sort.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They do much better who enumerate the different virtues as Georgias did, than those who thus define them; and as Sophocles speaks of a woman, we think of all persons, that their 'virtues should be applicable to their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, for says he, "Silence is a woman's ornament," but it is not a man's; and as a child is incomplete, it is evident that his virtue is not to be referred to himself in his present situation, but to that in which he will be complete, and his preceptor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In like manner the virtue of a slave is to be referred to his master; for we laid it down as a maxim, that the use of a slave was to employ him in what you wanted; so that it is clear enough that few virtues are wanted in his station, only that he may not neglect his work through idleness or fear: some person may <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> if what I have said is true, whether virtue is not necessary for artificers in their calling, for they often through idleness neglect their work, but the difference between them is very great; for a slave is connected with you for life, but the artificer not so nearly: as near therefore as the artificer approaches to the situation of a slave, just so much ought he to have of the virtues of one; for a mean artificer is to a certain point a slave; but then a slave is one of those things which are by nature what they are, but this is not true [1260b] of a shoemaker, or any other artist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is necessary, I am sensible, for every one who treats upon government, to enter particularly into the relations of husband and wife, and of parent and child, and to show what are the virtues of each and their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive connections with each other; what is right and what is wrong; and how the one ought to be followed, and the other avoided.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will begin with that part of the subject which naturally presents itself first to our <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But as it is evidently better, that these should continue to exercise their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive trades; so also in civil society, where it is possible, it would be better that the government should continue in the same hands; but where it [1261b] is not (as nature has made all men equal, and therefore it is just, be the administration good or bad, that all should partake of it), there it is best to observe a rotation, and let those who are their equals by turns submit to those who are at that time magistrates, as they will, in their turns, alternately be governors and governed, as if they were different men: by the same method different persons will execute different offices.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER III But admitting that it is most advantageous for a city to be one as much as possible, it does not seem to follow that this will take place by permitting all at once to say this is mine, and this is not mine (though this is what Socrates <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s as a proof that a city is entirely one), for the word All is used in two senses; if it means each individual, what Socrates proposes will nearly take place; for each person will say, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own property, and of everything else that may happen to belong to him, that it is his own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, there would be another inconvenience attending this proposal, for what is common to many is taken least <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of; for all men <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> more what is their own than what others share with them in, to which they pay less attention than is incumbent on every one: let me add also, that every one is more negligent of what another is to see to, as well as himself, than of his own private business; as in a family one is often worse served by many servants than by a few.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, in consequence of this, [1262a] whenever any citizen behaved well or ill, every person, be the number what it would, might say, this is my son, or this man's or that; and in this manner would they speak, and thus would they doubt of the whole thousand, or of whatever number the city consisted; and it would be uncertain to whom each child belonged, and when it was born, who was to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of it: and which do you think is better, for every one to say this is mine, while they may apply it equally to two thousand or ten thousand; or as we say, this is mine in our present forms of government, where one man calls another his son, another calls that same person his brother, another nephew, or some other relation, either by blood or marriage, and first extends his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to him and his, while another <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s him as one of the same parish and the same tribe; and it is better for any one to be a nephew in his private capacity than a son after that manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, it will be impossible to prevent some persons from suspecting that they are brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers to each other; for, from the mutual likeness there is between the sire and the offspring, they will necessarily conclude in what relation they stand to each other, which circumstance, we are informed by those writers who describe different parts of the world, does sometimes happen; for in Upper Africa there are wives in common who yet deliver their children to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive fathers, being guided by their likeness to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seems also more advantageous for the state, that the husbandmen should have their wives and children in common than the military, for there will be less affection [1262b] among them in that case than when otherwise; for such persons ought to be under subjection, that they may obey the laws, and not seek after <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But now in a city which admits of this community, the tie of friendship must, from that very cause, be extremely weak, when no father can say, this is my son; or son, this is my father; for as a very little of what is sweet, being mixed with a great deal of water is imperceptible after the mixture, so must all family connections, and the names they go by, be necessarily dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed in such a community, it being then by no means necessary that the father should have any <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for him he called a son, or the brothers for those they call brothers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are two things which principally inspire mankind with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and love of their offspring, knowing it is their own, and what ought to be the object of their affection, neither of which can take place in this sort of community.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER V We proceed next to consider in what manner property should be regulated in a state which is formed after the most perfect mode of government, whether it should be common or not; for this may be considered as a separate <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> from what had been determined concerning [1263a] wives and children; I mean, whether it is better that these should be held separate, as they now everywhere are, or that not only possessions but also the usufruct of them should be in common; or that the soil should have a particular owner, but that the produce should be brought together and used as one common stock, as some nations at present do; or on the contrary, should the soil be common, and should it also be cultivated in common, while the produce is divided amongst the individuals for their particular use, which is said to be practised by some barbarians; or shall both the soil and the fruit be common? When the business of the husbandman devolves not on the citizen, the matter is much easier settled; but when those labour together who have a common right of possession, this may occasion several difficulties; for there may not be an equal proportion between their labour and what they consume; and those who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the produce, will certainly complain of those who take a large share of it and do but little for that.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Upon the whole, as a community between man and man so entire as to include everything possible, and thus to have all things that man can possess in common, is very difficult, so is it particularly so with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to property; and this is evident from that community which takes place between those who go out to settle a colony; for they frequently have disputes with each other upon the most common occasions, and come to blows upon trifles: we find, too, that we oftenest correct those slaves who are generally employed in the common offices of the family: a community of property then has these and other inconveniences attending it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the manner of life which is now established, more particularly when embellished with good morals and a system of equal laws, is far superior to it, for it will have the advantage of both; by both I mean properties being common, and divided also; for in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it ought to be in a manner common, but upon the whole private: for every man's attention being employed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutual complaints against each other; nay, by this means industry will be increased, as each person will labour to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> his own private property; and it will then be, that from a principle of virtue they will mutually perform good offices to each other, according to the proverb, "All things are common amongst friends;" and in some cities there are traces of this custom to be seen, so that it is not impracticable, and particularly in those which are best governed; some things are by this means in a manner common, and others might be so; for there, every person enjoying his own private property, some things he <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>s his friend with, others are considered as in common; as in Lacedaemon, where they use each other's slaves, as if they were, so to speak, their own, as they do their horses and dogs, or even any provision they may want in a journey.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to pleasure, it is unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man should think he has something which he may call his own; for it is by no means to no purpose, that each person should have an affection for himself, for that is natural, and yet to be a self-lover is justly censured; for we mean by that, not one that simply loves himself, but one that loves himself more than he ought; in like manner we blame a money-lover, and yet both money and self is what all men love.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, it is very pleasing to us to oblige and <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> our friends and companions, as well as those whom we are connected with by the rights of hospitality; and this cannot be done without the establishment of private property, which cannot take place with those who make a city too much one; besides, they prevent every opportunity of exercising two principal virtues, <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> and liberality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Modesty with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the female sex, for this virtue requires you to abstain from her who is another's; liberality, which depends upon private property, for without that no one can appear liberal, or do any generous action; for liberality consists in imparting to others what is our own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This system of polity does indeed recommend itself by its good appearance and specious pretences to humanity; and when first proposed to any one, must give him great pleasure, as he will conclude it to be a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful bond of friendship, connecting all to all; particularly when any one censures the evils which are now to be found in society, as arising from properties not being common, I mean the disputes which happen between man and man, upon their different contracts with each other; those judgments which are passed in court in consequence of fraud, and perjury, and flattering the rich, none of which arise from properties being private, but from the vices of mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But yet, whosoever shall introduce any education, and think thereby to make his city excellent and <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able, will be absurd, while he expects to form it by such regulations, and not by manners, philosophy, and laws.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor has Socrates told us (nor is it easy to say) what plan of government should be pursued with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the individuals in the state where there is a community of goods established; for though the majority of his citizens will in general consist of a multitude of persons of different occupations, of those he has determined nothing; whether the property of the husbandman ought to be in common, or whether each person should have his share to himself; and also, whether their wives and children ought to be in common: for if all things are to be alike common to all, where will be the difference between them and the military, or what would they get by submitting to their government? and upon what principles would they do it, unless they should establish the wise practice of the Cretans? for they, allowing everything else to their slaves, forbid them only gymnastic exercises and the use of arms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And if they are not, but these should be in the same situation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their property which they are in other cities, what sort of a community will there be? in one city there must of necessity be two, and those contrary to each other; for he makes the military the guardians of the state, and the husbandman, artisans, and others, citizens; and all those quarrels, accusations, and things of the like sort, which he says are the bane of other cities, will be found in his also: notwithstanding Socrates says they will not want many laws in consequence of their education, but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets, the markets, and the like, while at the same time it is the education of the military only that he has taken any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, if he makes the wives common, while the property [1264b] continues separate, who shall manage the domestic concerns with the same <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which the man bestows upon his fields? nor will the inconvenience be remedied by making property as well as wives common; and it is absurd to draw a comparison from the brute creation, and say, that the same principle should regulate the connection of a man and a woman which regulates theirs amongst whom there is no family association.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy as Socrates has done; for he would have persons of the same rank always in office, which becomes the cause of sedition even amongst those who are of no account, but more particularly amongst those who are of a courageous and warlike <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; it is indeed evidently necessary that he should frame his community in this manner; for that golden particle which God has mixed up in the soul of man flies not from one to the other, but always continues with the same; for he says, that some of our species have gold, and others silver, blended in their composition from the moment of their birth: but those who are to be husbandmen and artists, brass and iron; besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says, that the legislator ought to make all the citizens happy; but it is impossible that the whole city can be happy, without all, or the greater, or some part of it be happy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He thinks also that the women ought to go to war, and have the same education as the soldiers; as to other particulars, he has filled his treatise with matter foreign to the purpose; and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to education, he has only said what that of the guards ought to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For now with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the number just spoken of, it must be acknowledged that he would want the country of Babylonia for them, or some one like it, of an immeasurable extent, to support five thousand idle persons, besides a much greater number of women and servants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He will also do well, if he has some <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the neighbouring states, if he intends that his community should maintain any political intercourse with them, for it is not only necessary that they should <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> that practice of war which is adapted to their own country, but to others also; for admitting that any one chooses not this life either in public or private, yet there is not the less occasion for their being formidable to their enemies, not only when they invade their country, but also when they retire out of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, a man may live moderately and miserably at the same time; he had therefore better have proposed, that they should live both moderately and liberally; for unless these two conspire, luxury will come in on the one hand, or wretchedness on the other, since these two modes of living are the only ones applicable to the employment of our substance; for we cannot say with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to a man's fortune, that he is mild or courageous, but we may say that he is prudent and liberal, which are the only qualities connected therewith.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is more necessary than even to regulate property, to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the increase of the people should not exceed a certain number; and in determining that, to take into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> those children who will die, and also those women who will be barren; and to neglect this, as is done in several cities, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VII There are also some other forms of government, which have been proposed either by private persons, or philosophers, or politicians, all of which come much nearer to those which have been really established, or now exist, than these two of Plato's; for neither have they introduced the <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong> of a community of wives and children, and public tables for the women, but have been contented to set out with establishing such rules as are absolutely necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That an equality of goods was in some degree <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to strengthen the bands of society, seems to have been known to some of the ancients; for Solon made a law, as did some others also, to restrain persons from possessing as much land as they pleased.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he should have said particularly what education he intended, nor is it of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to have this to much one; for this education may be one, and yet such as will make the citizens over-greedy, to grasp after honours, or riches, or both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What remedy then shall we find for these three disorders? And first, to prevent stealing from necessity, let every one be supplied with a moderate subsistence, which may make the addition of his own industry necessary; second to prevent stealing to procure the luxuries of life, temperance be enjoined; and thirdly, let those who wish for pleasure in itself seek for it only in philosophy, all others want the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance of men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has also been very desirous to establish such rules as will conduce to perfect the internal policy of his state, and he ought also to have done the same with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its neighbours and all foreign nations; for the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s of the military establishment should take place in planning every government, that it may not be unprovided in case of a war, of which he has said nothing; so also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to property, it ought not only to be adapted to the exigencies of the state, but also to such dangers as may arise from without.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, indeed, some advantage in an equality of goods amongst the citizens to prevent seditions; and yet, to say <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, no very great one; for men of great abilities will stomach their being put upon a level with the rest of the community.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But for this purpose the first object is, not so much to establish an equality of fortune, as to prevent those who are of a good <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> from desiring more than their own, and those who are of a bad one from being able to acquire it; and this may be done if they are kept in an inferior station, and not exposed to injustice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This man was in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s too eager after notice, and seemed to many to live in a very affected manner, with his flowing locks and his expensive ornaments, and a coarse warm vest which he wore, not only in the winter, but also in the hot weather.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As he was very desirous of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a universal scholar, he was the first who, not being actually engaged in the management of public affairs, sat himself to inquire what sort of government was best; and he planned a state, consisting of ten thousand persons, divided into three parts, one consisting of artisans, another of husbandmen, and the third of soldiers; he also divided the lands into three parts, and allotted one to sacred purposes, another to the public, and the third to individuals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first of these was to supply what was necessary for the established <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of the gods; the second was to be allotted to the support of the soldiery; and the third was to be the property of the husbandman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now when any matter is brought to arbitration, it is customary for many persons to confer together upon the business that is before them; but when a cause is brought before judges it is not so; and many legislators take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the judges shall not have it in their power to communicate their sentiments to each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to these honours which he proposes to bestow on those who can give any information useful to the community, this, though very pleasing in speculation, is what the legislator should not settle, for it would encourage informers, and probably occasion commotions in the state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Upon the whole, all persons ought to endeavour to follow what is right, and not what is established; and it is probable that the first men, whether they sprung out of the earth, or were saved from some general calamity, had very little <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing or knowledge, as is affirmed of these aborigines; so that it would be absurd to continue in the practice of their rules.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if we consider this matter in another point of view, it will appear to require great caution; for when the advantage proposed is trifling, as the accustoming the people easily to abolish their laws is of bad consequence, it is evidently better to pass over some faults which either the legislator or the magistrates may have committed; for the alterations will not be of so much <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> as a habit of disobeying the magistrates will be of dis<strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, here is another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; if the laws are to be altered, are they all to be altered, and in every government or not, and whether at the pleasure of one person or many? all which particulars will make a great difference; for which reason we will at present drop the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, to pursue it at some other time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER IX There are two <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s which offer themselves with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the government established at Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in almost all other states whatsoever; one is whether their laws do or do not promote the best establishment possible? the other is whether there is anything, if we consider either the principles upon which it is founded or the executive part of it, which prevents the form of government that they had proposed to follow from being observed; now it is allowed that in every well-regulated state the members of it should be free from servile labour; but in what manner this shall be effected is not so easy to determine; for the Penestse have very often attacked the Thessalians, and the Helots the Lacedaemonians, for they in a manner continually watch an opportunity for some misfortune befalling them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In whatever city then the women are not under good regulations, we must look upon one half of it as not under the restraint of law, as it there happened; for the legislator, desiring to make his whole city a collection of warriors with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the men, he most evidently accomplished his design; but in the meantime the women were quite neglected, for they live without restraint in every improper indulgence and luxury.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that in such a state riches will necessarily be in general <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>, particularly if the men are governed by their wives, which has been the case with many a brave and warlike people except the Celts, and those other nations, if there are any such, who openly practise pederasty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the first mythologists seem not improperly to have joined Mars and Venus together; for all nations of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> are greatly addicted either to the love of women or of boys, for which reason it was thus at Lacedaemon; and many things in their state were done by the authority of the women.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As this boldness of the women can be of no use in any common occurrences, if it was ever so, it must be in war; but even here we find that the Lacedaemonian women were of the greatest dis<strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, as was proved at the time of the Theban invasion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other cities, but made more disturbance than even the enemy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This magistracy is indeed the great support of the state; for the people are easy, knowing that they are eligible to the first office in it; so that, whether it took place by the intention of the legislator, or whether it happened by chance, this is of great <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to their affairs; for it is necessary that every member of the state should endeavour that each part of the government should be preserved, and continue the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And upon this principle their kings have always acted, out of <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to their honour; the wise and good from their attachment to the senate, a seat wherein they consider as the reward of virtue; and the common people, that they may support the ephori, of whom they consist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For making his citizens ambitious after honours, with men of that <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> he has filled his senate, since no others will solicit for that office; and yet the principal part of those crimes which men are deliberately guilty of arise from ambition and avarice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will inquire at another time whether the office of a king is useful to the state: thus much is certain, that they should be chosen from a <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of their conduct and not as they are now.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For it appears and is allowed in many particulars the constitution of Lacedaemon was formed in imitation of that of Crete; and in general most new things are an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment upon the old.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XI The government of Carthage seems well established, and in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s superior to others; in some particulars it bears a near resemblance to the Lacedaemonians; and indeed these three states, the Cretans, the Lacedaemonians and the Carthaginians are in some things very like each other, in others they differ greatly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the Carthaginians have these things in common with the Lacedaemonians: public tables for those who are connected together by the tie of mutual friendship, after the manner of their Phiditia; they have also a magistracy, consisting of an hundred and four persons, similar to the ephori, or rather selected with more judgment; for amongst the Lacedaemonians, all the citizens are eligible, but amongst the Carthaginians, they are chosen out of those of the better sort: there is also some analogy between the king and the senate in both these governments, though the Carthaginian method of appointing their kings is best, for they do not confine themselves to one family; nor do they permit the election to be at large, nor have they any <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to seniority; for if amongst the candidates there are any of greater merit than the rest, these they prefer to those who may be older; for as their power is very extensive, if they are [1273a] persons of no account, they may be very hurtful to the state, as they have always been to the Lacedaemonians; also the greater part of those things which become reprehensible by their excess are common to all those governments which we have described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must be admitted, that it was a great fault in their legislator not to guard against the constitution's degenerating from an aristocracy; for this is a most necessary thing to provide for at first, that those citizens who have the best abilities should never be obliged to do anything unworthy their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but be always at leisure to serve the public, not only when in office, but also when private persons; for if once you are obliged to look among the wealthy, that you may have men at leisure to serve you, your greatest offices, of king and general, will soon become venal; in consequence of which, riches will be more honourable than virtue and a love of money be the ruling principle in the city-for what those who have the chief power <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as honourable will necessarily be the object which the [1273b] citizens in general will aim at; and where the first honours are not paid to virtue, there the aristocratic form of government cannot flourish: for it is reasonable to conclude, that those who bought their places should generally make an advantage of what they laid out their money for; as it is absurd to suppose, that if a man of probity who is poor should be desirous of gaining something, a bad man should not endeavour to do the same, especially to reimburse himself; for which reason the magistracy should be formed of those who are most able to support an aristocracy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would have been better for the legislature to have passed over the poverty of men of merit, and only to have taken <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to have ensured them sufficient leisure, when in office, to attend to public affairs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It seems also improper, that one person should execute several offices, which was approved of at Carthage; for one business is best done by one person; and it is the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of the legislator to look to this, and not make the same person a musician and a shoemaker: so that where the state is not small it is more politic and more popular to admit many persons to have a share in the government; for, as I just now said, it is not only more usual, but everything is better and sooner done, when one thing only is allotted to one person: and this is evident both in the army and navy, where almost every one, in his turn, both commands and is under command.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Solon seems not to have altered the established form of government, either with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the senate or the mode of electing their magistrates; but to have raised the people to great <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> in the state by allotting the supreme judicial department to them; and for this some persons blame him, as having done what would soon overturn that balance of power he intended to establish; for by trying all causes whatsoever before the people, who were chosen by lot to determine them, it was necessary to flatter a tyrannical populace who had got this power; which contributed to bring the government to that pure democracy it now is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some persons endeavour to prove that Onomacritus, the Locrian, was the first person of note who drew up laws; and that he employed himself in that business while he was at Crete, where he continued some time to learn the prophetic art: and they say, that Thales was his companion; and that Lycurgus and Zaleucus were the scholars of Thales, and Charondas of Zaleucus; but those who <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> this, <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> what is repugnant to chronology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Charondas did nothing new, except in actions for perjury, which he was the first person who took into particular <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pittacus was the author of some laws, but never drew up any form of government; one of which was this, that if a drunken man beat any person he should be punished more than if he did it when sober; for as people are more apt to be abusive when drunk than sober, he paid no <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> to the excuse which drunkenness might claim, but <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed only the common benefit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>BOOK III CHAPTER I Every one who inquires into the nature of government, and what are its different forms, should make this almost his first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, What is a city? For upon this there is a dispute: for some persons say the city did this or that, while others say, not the city, but the oligarchy, or the tyranny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a city is a collective body, and, like other wholes, composed of many parts, it is evident our first <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> must be, what a citizen is: for a city is a certain number of citizens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that we must consider whom we ought to call citizen, and who is one; for this is often doubtful: for every one will not allow that this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is applicable to the same person; for that man who would be a citizen in a republic would very often not be one in an oligarchy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We do not include in this <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> many of those who acquire this appellation out of the ordinary way, as honorary persons, for instance, but those only who have a natural right to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In like manner, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to boys who are not yet enrolled, or old men who are past war, we admit that they are in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s citizens, but not completely so, but with some exceptions, for these are not yet arrived to years of maturity, and those are past <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; nor is there any difference between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is nothing that more <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ises a complete citizen than having a share in the judicial and executive part of the government.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to offices, some are fixed to a particular time, so that no person is, on any account, permitted to fill them twice; or else not till some certain period has intervened; others are not fixed, as a juryman's, and a member of the general assembly: but probably some one may say these are not offices, nor have the citizens in these capacities any share in the government; though surely it is ridiculous to say that those who have the principal power in the state bear no office in it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, but some persons have <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed how the first of the family could prove themselves citizens, according to this popular and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less definition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As, for instance, at Athens, after the expulsion of the tyrants, when Clisthenes enrolled many foreigners and city-slaves amongst the tribes; and the doubt with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to them was, not whether they were citizens or no, but whether they were legally so or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though indeed some persons may have this further [1276a] doubt, whether a citizen can be a citizen when he is illegally made; as if an illegal citizen, and one who is no citizen at all, were in the same predicament: but since we see some persons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to govern, though not justly, and the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices, for such a one we have defined a citizen to be, it is evident, that a citizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen, but whether justly or unjustly so belongs to the former <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And here it seems very proper to consider this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, When shall we say that a city is the same, and when shall we say that it is different? It is but a superficial mode of examining into this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to begin with the place and the people; for it may happen that these may be divided from that, or that some one of them may live in one place, and some in another (but this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as no very knotty one; for, as a city may acquire that appellation on many accounts, it may be solved many ways); and in like manner, when men inhabit one common place, when shall we say that they inhabit the same city, or that the city is the same? for it does not depend upon the walls; for I can suppose Peloponnesus itself surrounded with a wall, as Babylon was, and every other place, which rather encircles many nations than one city, and that they say was taken three days when some of the inhabitants knew nothing of it: but we shall find a proper time to determine this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; for the extent of a city, how large it should be, and whether it should consist of more than one people, these are particulars that the politician should by no means be unacquainted with.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This, too, is a matter of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, whether we shall say that a city is the same while it is inhabited by the same race of men, though some of them are perpetually dying, others coming into the world, as we say that a river or a fountain is the same, though the waters are continually changing; or when a revolution takes place shall we [1276b] say the men are the same, but the city is different: for if a city is a community, it is a community of citizens; but if the mode of government should alter, and become of another sort, it would seem a necessary consequence that the city is not the same; as we <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the tragic chorus as different from the comic, though it may probably consist of the same performers: thus every other community or composition is said to be different if the species of composition is different; as in music the same hands produce different harmony, as the Doric and Phrygian.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whether or no it is right to dissolve the community when the constitution is altered is another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER IV What has been said, it follows that we should consider whether the same virtues which constitute a good man make a valuable citizen, or different; and if a particular <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> is necessary for this matter we must first give a general description of the virtues of a good citizen; for as a sailor is one of those who make up a community, so is a citizen, although the province of one sailor may be different from another's (for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boatswain, and so on, each having their several appointments), it is evident that the most accurate description of any one good sailor must refer to his peculiar abilities, yet there are some things in which the same description may be applied to the whole crew, as the safety of the ship is the common business of all of them, for this is the general centre of all their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s: so also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to citizens, although they may in a few particulars be very different, yet there is one <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> common to them all, the safety of the community, for the community of the citizens composes the state; for which reason the virtue of a citizen has necessarily a reference to the state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who are any ways doubtful concerning this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be convinced of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of it by examining into the best formed states: for, if it is impossible that a city should consist entirely of excellent citizens (while it is necessary that every one should do well in his calling, in which consists his excellence, as it is impossible that all the citizens should have the same [1277a] qualifications) it is impossible that the virtue of a citizen and a good man should be the same; for all should possess the virtue of an excellent citizen: for from hence necessarily arise the perfection of the city: but that every one should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible without all the citizens in a well-regulated state were necessarily virtuous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is a government of another sort, in which men govern those who are their equals in rank, and freemen, which we call a political government, in which men learn to command by first submitting to obey, as a good general of horse, or a commander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge of their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> by having been long under the command of another, and the like in every appointment in the army: for well is it said, no one knows how to command who has not himself been under command of another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The virtues of those are indeed different, but a good citizen must necessarily be endowed with them; he ought also to know in what manner freemen ought to govern, as well as be governed: and this, too, is the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of a good man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The domestic employments of each of them are also different; it is the man's business to acquire subsistence, the woman's to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER V But with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to citizens there is a doubt remaining, whether those only are truly so who are allowed to share in the government, or whether the mechanics also are to be considered as such? for if those who are not permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, it is impossible that the virtue of all the citizens should be the same, for these also are citizens; and if none of them are admitted to be citizens, where shall they be ranked? for they are neither [1278a] sojourners nor foreigners? or shall we say that there will no inconvenience arise from their not being citizens, as they are neither slaves nor freedmen: for this is certainly true, that all those are not citizens who are necessary to the existence of a city, as boys are not citizens in the same manner that men are, for those are perfectly so, the others under some conditions; for they are citizens, though imperfect ones: for in former times among some people the mechanics were either slaves or foreigners, for which reason many of them are so now: and indeed the best regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a citizen; but if it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute the virtue we have described to every citizen or freeman, but to those only who are disengaged from servile offices.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same is also observed in many others with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to natural children; but it is through want of citizens regularly born that they admit such: for these laws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of inhabitants; so, as their numbers increase, they first deprive the children of a male or female slave of this privilege, next the child of a free-woman, and last of all they will admit none but those whose fathers and mothers were both free.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have already mentioned in my treatise on the management of a family, and the power of the master, that man is an animal naturally formed for society, and that therefore, when he does not want any foreign <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, he will of his own accord desire to live with others; not but that mutual advantage induces them to it, as far as it enables each person to live more agreeably; and this is indeed the great object not only to all in general, but also to each individual: but it is not merely matter of choice, but they join in society also, even that they may be able to live, which probably is not without some share of merit, and they also support civil society, even for the sake of preserving life, without they are grievously overwhelmed with the miseries of it: for it is very evident that men will endure many calamities for the sake of living, as being something naturally sweet and desirable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The power of the master, though by nature equally <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, both to the master and to the slave, yet nevertheless has for its object the benefit of the master, while the benefit of the slave arises accidentally; for if the slave is destroyed, the power of the master is at an end: but the authority which a man has over his wife, and children, and his family, which we call domestic government, is either for the benefit of those who are under subjection, or else for the common benefit of the whole: but its particular object is the benefit of the governed, as we see in other arts; in physic, for instance, and the gymnastic exercises, wherein, if any benefit [1279a] arise to the master, it is accidental; for nothing forbids the master of the exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who exercises, as the steersman is always one of the sailors; but both the master of the exercises and the steersman consider the good of those who are under their government.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VIII It will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of each of these states, which is not without some difficulty, for he who would enter into a philosophical <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into the principles of them, and not content himself with a superficial view of their outward conduct, must pass over and omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the first difficulty that arises from the distinctions which we have laid down is this, should it happen that the majority of the inhabitants who possess the power of the state (for this is a democracy) should be rich, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, how does this agree with what we have said? The same difficulty occurs, should it ever happen that the poor compose a smaller part of the people than the rich, but from their superior abilities acquire the supreme power; for this is what they call an oligarchy; it should seem then that our definition of the different states was not correct: nay, moreover, could any one suppose that the majority of the people were poor, and the minority rich, and then describe the state in this manner, that an oligarchy was a government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed the supreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which the poor, being many in number, possessed it, still there will be another difficulty; for what name shall we give to those states we have been describing? I mean, that in which the greater number are rich, and that in which the lesser number are poor (where each of these possess the supreme power), if there are no other states than those we have described.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since then justice has reference to persons, the same distinctions must be made with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to persons which are made with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to things, in the manner that I have already described in my Ethics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of its members; but that they might live well: for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves, or the animal creation: but this is not so; for these have no share in the happiness of it; nor do they live after their own choice; nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from injuries, or for a commercial intercourse: for then the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians, and all other nations between whom treaties of commerce subsist, would be citizens of one city; for they have articles to regulate their exports and imports, and engagements for mutual protection, and alliances for mutual defence; but [1280b] yet they have not all the same magistrates established among them, but they are different among the different people; nor does the one take any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, that the morals of the other should be as they ought, or that none of those who have entered into the common agreements should be unjust, or in any degree vicious, only that they do not injure any member of the confederacy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whosoever endeavours to establish wholesome laws in a state, attends to the virtues and the vices of each individual who composes it; from whence it is evident, that the first <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of him who would found a city, truly deserving that name, and not nominally so, must be to have his citizens virtuous; for otherwise it is merely an alliance for self-defence; differing from those of the same cast which are made between different people only in place: for law is an agreement and a pledge, as the sophist Lycophron says, between the citizens of their intending to do justice to each other, though not sufficient to make all the citizens just and good: and that this is fact is evident, for could any one bring different places together, as, for instance, enclose Megara and Corinth in a wall, yet they would not be one city, not even if the inhabitants intermarried with each other, though this inter-community contributes much to make a place one city.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And why? not because their mutual intercourse is not near enough, for even if persons so situated should come to one place, and every one should live in his own house as in his native city, and there should be alliances subsisting between each party to mutually <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> and prevent any injury being done to the other, still they would not be admitted to be a city by those who think correctly, if they preserved the same customs when they were together as when they were separate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if this law appoints an aristocracy, or a democracy, how will it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> us in our present doubts? for those things will happen which we have already mentioned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XI Other particulars we will consider separately; but it seems proper to prove, that the supreme power ought to be lodged with the many, rather than with those of the better sort, who are few; and also to explain what doubts (and probably just ones) may arise: now, though not one individual of the many may himself be fit for the supreme power, yet when these many are joined together, it does not follow but they may be better qualified for it than those; and this not separately, but as a collective body; as the public suppers exceed those which are given at one person's private expense: for, as they are many, each person brings in his share of virtue and wisdom; and thus, coming together, they are like one man made up of a multitude, with many feet, many hands, and many intelligences: thus is it with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the manners and <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ings of the multitude taken together; for which reason the public are the best judges of music and poetry; for some <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> one part, some another, and all collectively the whole; and in this particular men of consequence differ from each of the many; as they say those who are beautiful do from those who are not so, and as fine pictures excel any natural objects, by collecting the several beautiful parts which were dispersed among different originals into one, although the separate parts, as the eye or any other, might be handsomer than in the picture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if this distinction is to be made between every people and every general assembly, and some few men of consequence, it may be doubtful whether it is true; nay, it is clear enough that, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to a few, it is not; since the same conclusion might be applied even to brutes: and indeed wherein do some men differ from brutes? Not but that nothing prevents what I have said being true of the people in some states.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The doubt then which we have lately proposed, with all its consequences, may be settled in this manner; it is necessary that the freemen who compose the bulk of the people should have absolute power in some things; but as they are neither men of property, nor act uniformly upon principles of virtue, it is not safe to trust them with the first offices in the state, both on account of their iniquity and their ignorance; from the one of which they will do what is wrong, from the other they will mistake: and yet it is dangerous to allow them no power or share in the government; for when there are many poor people who are incapable of acquiring the honours of their country, the state must necessarily have many enemies in it; let them then be permitted to vote in the public assemblies and to determine causes; for which reason Socrates, and some other legislators, gave them the power of electing the officers of the state, and also of inquiring into their conduct when they came out of office, and only prevented their being magistrates by themselves; for the multitude when they are collected together have all of them sufficient <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing for these purposes, and, mixing among those of higher rank, are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to the city, as some things, which alone are improper for food, when mixed with others make the whole more wholesome than a few of them would be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is a difficulty attending this form of government, for it seems, that the person who himself was capable of curing any one who was then sick, must be the best judge whom to employ as a physician; but such a one must be himself a physician; and the same holds true in every other practice and art: and as a physician ought [1282a] to give an account of his practice to a physician, so ought it to be in other arts: those whose business is physic may be divided into three sorts, the first of these is he who makes up the medicines; the second prescribes, and is to the other as the architect is to the mason; the third is he who <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s the science, but never practises it: now these three distinctions may be found in those who <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> all other arts; nor have we less opinion of their judgment who are only instructed in the principles of the art than of those who practise it: and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to elections the same method of proceeding seems right; for to elect a proper person in any science is the business of those who are skilful therein; as in geometry, of geometricians; in steering, of steersmen: but if some individuals should know something of particular arts and works, they do not know more than the professors of them: so that even upon this principle neither the election of magistrates, nor the censure of their conduct, should be entrusted to the many.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What has been said seems a sufficient solution of this difficulty; but there is another that follows: for it seems absurd that the power of the state should be lodged with those who are but of indifferent morals, instead of those who are of excellent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> that we stated shows plainly, that the supreme power should be lodged in laws duly made and that the magistrate or magistrates, either one or more, should be authorised to determine those cases which the laws cannot particularly speak to, as it is impossible for them, in general language, to explain themselves upon everything that may arise: but what these laws are which are established upon the best foundations has not been yet explained, but still remains a matter of some <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>: but the laws of every state will necessarily be like every state, either trifling or excellent, just or unjust; for it is evident, that the laws must be framed correspondent to the constitution of the government; and, if so, it is plain, that a well-formed government will have good laws, a bad one, bad ones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some persons will probably say, that the employments of the state ought to be given according to every particular excellence of each citizen, if there is no other difference between them and the rest of the community, but they are in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> else alike: for justice attributes different things to persons differing from each other in their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, according to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive merits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But that this is evidently absurd is clear from other arts and sciences; for with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to musicians who play on the flute together, the best flute is not given to him who is of the best family, for he will play never the better for that, but the best instrument ought to be given to him who is the best artist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The freemen and men of family will dispute the point with each other, as nearly on an equality; for these latter have a right to a higher <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as citizens than obscure persons, for honourable descent is everywhere of great <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>: nor is it an improper conclusion, that the descendants of men of worth will be men of worth themselves; for noble birth is the fountain of virtue to men of family: for the same reason also we justly say, that virtue has a right to put in her pretensions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All these things seem to make it plain, that none of these principles are justly founded on which these persons would establish their right to the supreme power; and that all men whatsoever ought to obey them: for with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to those who claim it as due to their virtue or their fortune, they might have justly some objection to make; for nothing hinders but that it may sometimes happen, that the many may be better or richer than the few, not as individuals, but in their collective capacity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor is this <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to tyrants only; nor is it tyrants only who do it; for the same thing is practised both in oligarchies and democracies: for the ostracism has in a manner nearly the same power, by restraining and banishing those who are too great; and what is done in one city is done also by those who have the supreme power in separate states; as the Athenians with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Samians, the Chians, and the Lesbians; for when they suddenly acquired the superiority over all Greece, they brought the other states into subjection, contrary to the treaties which subsisted between them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is therefore no reason that a monarch should not act in agreement with free states, to support his own power, if they do the same thing for the benefit of their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive communities; upon which account when there is any acknowledged difference in the power of the citizens, the reason upon which the ostracism is founded will be politically just; but it is better for the legislator so to establish his state at the beginning as not to want this remedy: but if in course of time such an inconvenience should arise, to endeavour to amend it by some such correction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not that this was the use it was put to: for many did not <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the benefit of their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive communities, but made the ostracism a weapon in the hand of sedition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This, then, is one species of monarchical government in which the kingly power is in a general for life; and is sometimes hereditary, sometimes elective: besides, there is also another, which is to be met with among some of the barbarians, in which the kings are invested with powers nearly equal to a tyranny, yet are, in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, bound by the laws and the customs of their country; for as the barbarians are by nature more prone to slavery than the Greeks, and those in Asia more than those in Europe, they endure without murmuring a despotic government; for this reason their governments are tyrannies; but yet not liable to be overthrown, as being customary and according to law.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The last spoken of, and the Lacedaemonian, for the chief of the others are placed between these, which are as it were at the extremities, they having less power than an absolute government, and yet more than the Lacedaemonians; so that the whole matter in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be reduced to these two points; the one is, whether it is advantageous to the citizens to have the office of general continue in one person for life, and whether it should be confined to any particular families or whether every one should be eligible: the other, whether [1286a] it is advantageous for one person to have the supreme power over everything or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Passing over this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> then, we will proceed to consider the other part of their government, which is the polity of the state; and this it will be necessary to examine particularly into, and to go through such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s as may arise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the first thing which presents itself to our <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is this, whether it is best to be governed by a good man, or by good laws? Those who prefer a kingly government think that laws can only speak a general language, but cannot adapt themselves to particular circumstances; for which reason it is absurd in any science to follow written rule; and even in Egypt the physician was allowed to alter the mode of cure which the law prescribed to him, after the fourth day; but if he did it sooner it was at his own peril: from whence it is evident, on the very same account, that a government of written laws is not the best; and yet general reasoning is necessary to all those who are to govern, and it will be much more perfect in those who are entirely free from passions than in those to whom they are natural.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As for an absolute monarchy as it is called, that is to say, when the whole state is wholly subject to the will of one person, namely the king, it seems to many that it is unnatural that one man should have the entire rule over his fellow-citizens when the state consists of equals: for nature requires that the same right and the same rank should necessarily take place amongst all those who are equal by nature: for as it would be hurtful to the body for those who are of different constitutions to observe the same regimen, either of diet or clothing, so is it with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the honours of the state as hurtful, that those who are equal in merit should be unequal in rank; for which reason it is as much a man's <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to submit to command as to assume it, and this also by rotation; for this is law, for order is law; and it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws, for the supreme power must be placed somewhere; but they say, that it is unjust that where all are equal one person should continually enjoy it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And, as a proof of what we have <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, it may be observed, that whenever a sick person suspects that his physician has been persuaded by his enemies to be guilty of any foul practice to him in his profession, he then rather chooses to apply to books for his cure: and not only this [1287b] but even physicians themselves when they are ill call in other physicians: and those who teach others the gymnastic exercises, exercise with those of the same profession, as being incapable from self-partiality to form a proper judgment of what concerns themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But whenever a whole family or any one of another shall happen so far to excel in virtue as to exceed all other persons in the community, then it is right that the kingly power should be in them, or if it is an individual who does so, that he should be king and lord of all; for this, as we have just mentioned, is not only correspondent to that principle of right which all founders of all states, whether aristocracies, oligarchies, or democracies, have a <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to (for in placing the supreme power they all think it right to fix it to excellence, though not the same); but it is also agreeable to what has been already said; as it would not be right to kill, or banish, or ostracise such a one for his superior merit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And thus much with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to kingly power in different states, and whether it is or is not advantageous to them, and to what, and in what manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XVIII Since then we have said that there are three sorts of regular governments, and of these the best must necessarily be that which is administered by the best men (and this must be that which happens to have one man, or one family, or a number of persons excelling all the rest in virtue, who are able to govern and be governed in such a manner as will make life most agreeable, and we have already shown that the virtue of a good man and of a citizen in the most perfect government will be the same), it is evident, that in the same manner, and for those very qualities which would procure a man the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of good, any one would say, that the government of a state was a well-established aristocracy or kingdom; so that it will be found to be education and [1288b] morals that are almost the whole which go to make a good man, and the same qualities will make a good citizen or good king.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These particulars being treated of, we will now proceed to consider what sort of government is best, how it naturally arises, and how it is established; for it is necessary to make a proper <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> concerning this.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, moreover, a third sort, an imaginary one, and he ought, if such a one should be presented to his <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, to be able to discern what sort of one it would be at the beginning; and, when once established, what would be the proper means to preserve it a long time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Others again, choosing [1289a] rather to treat of what is common, censure those under which they live, and extol the excellence of a particular state, as the Lacedaemonian, or some other: but every legislator ought to establish such a form of government as from the present state and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the people who are to receive it they will most readily submit to and persuade the community to partake of: for it is not a business of less trouble to correct the mistakes of an established government than to form a new one; as it is as difficult to recover what we have forgot as to learn anything afresh.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He, therefore, who aspires to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a legislator, ought, besides all we have already said, to be able to correct the mistakes of a government already established, as we have before mentioned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this is impossible to be done by him who does not know how many different forms of government there are: some persons think that there is only one species both of democracy and oligarchy; but this is not true: so that every one should be acquainted with the difference of these governments, how great they are, and whence they arise; and should have equal knowledge to perceive what laws are best, and what are most suitable to each particular government: for all laws are, and ought to be, framed agreeable to the state that is to be governed by them, and not the state to the laws: for government is a certain ordering in a state which particularly <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the magistrates in what manner they shall be regulated, and where the supreme power shall be placed; and what shall be the final object which each community shall have in view; but the laws are something different from what regulates and expresses the form of the constitution-it is their office to direct the conduct of the magistrate in the execution of his office and the punishment of offenders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER II Since, then, according to our first method in treating of the different forms of government, we have divided those which are regular into three sorts, the kingly, the aristocratical, the free states, and shown the three excesses which these are liable to: the kingly, of becoming tyrannical; the aristocratical, oligarchical; and the free state, democratical: and as we have already treated of the aristocratical and kingly; for to enter into an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> what sort of government is best is the same thing as to treat of these two expressly; for each of them desires to be established upon the principles of virtue: and as, moreover, we have already determined wherein a kingly power and an aristocracy differ from each other, and when a state may be said to be governed by a king, it now remains that we examine into a free state, and also these other governments, an oligarchy, a democracy, and a [1289b] tyranny; and it is evident of these three excesses which must be the worst of all, and which next to it; for, of course, the excesses of the best and most holy must be the worst; for it must necessarily happen either that the name of king only will remain, or else that the king will assume more power than belongs to him, from whence tyranny will arise, the worst excess imaginable, a government the most contrary possible to a free state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we shall not enter into at present.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And thus in politics, there is the government of the many and the government of the few; or a democracy and an oligarchy: for an aristocracy may be considered as a species of oligarchy, as being also a government of the few; and what we call a free state may be considered as a democracy: as in the winds they consider the west as part of the north, and the east as part of the south: and thus it is in music, according to some, who say there are only two species of it, the Doric and the Phrygian, and all other species of composition they call after one of these names; and many people are accustomed to consider the nature of government in the same light; but it is both more convenient and more correspondent to <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> to distinguish governments as I have done, into two species: one, of those which are established upon proper principles; of which there may be one or two sorts: the other, which includes all the different excesses of these; so that we may compare the best form of government to the most harmonious piece of music; the oligarchic and despotic to the more violent tunes; and the democratic to the soft and gentle airs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor are those things which we have already mentioned alone sufficient to describe these states; for since there are many species both of a democracy and an oligarchy, the matter requires further <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>; as we cannot admit, that if a few persons who are free possess the supreme power over the many who are not free, that this government is a democracy: as in Apollonia, in Ionia, and in Thera: for in each of these cities the honours of the state belong to some few particular families, who first founded the colonies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, then, the mind is a more valuable part of man than the body, every one would wish to have those things more <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed in his city which tend to the advantage of these than common matters, such are war and justice; to which may be added council, which is the business of civil wisdom (nor is it of any consequence whether these different employments are filled by different persons or one, as the same man is oftentimes both a soldier and a husbandman): so that if both the judge and the senator are parts of the city, it necessarily follows that the soldier must be so also.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VII There are besides two other states, a democracy and an oligarchy, one of which all speak of, and it is always <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a species of the four sorts; and thus they reckon them up; a monarchy, an oligarchy, a democracy, and this fourth which they call an aristocracy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, there are some other states which are called by the same name, that differ both from oligarchies and free states, wherein not only the rich but also the virtuous have a share in the administration; and have therefore acquired the name of aristocracies; for in those governments wherein virtue is not their common <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, there are still men of worth and approved goodness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever state, then, like the Carthaginians, favours the rich, the virtuous, and the citizens at large, is a sort of aristocracy: when only the two latter are held in <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>, as at Lacedaemon, and the state is jointly composed of these, it is a virtuous democracy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is proper to mention a tyranny the last of all governments, for it is of all others the least like one: but as my intention is to treat of all governments in general, for this reason that also, as I have said, will be taken into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> in its proper place.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I shall now inquire into a free state and show what it is; and we shall the better <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> its positive nature as we have already described an oligarchy and a democracy; for a free state is indeed nothing more than a mixture of them, and it has been usual to call those which incline most to a democracy, a free state; those which incline most to an oligarchy, an aristocracy, because those who are rich are generally men of family and education; besides, they enjoy those things which others are often guilty of crimes to procure: for which reason they are <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as men of worth and honour and note.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since, then, it is the genius of an aristocracy to allot the larger part of the government to the best citizens, they therefore say, that an oligarchy is chiefly composed of those men who are worthy and honourable: now it [1294a] seems impossible that where the government is in the hands of the good, there the laws should not be good, but bad; or, on the contrary, that where the government is in the hands of the bad, there the laws should be good; nor is a government well constituted because the laws are, without at the same time <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is taken that they are observed; for to enforce obedience to the laws which it makes is one proof of a good constitution in the state-another is, to have laws well calculated for those who are to abide by them; for if they are improper they must be obeyed: and this may be done two ways, either by their being the best relative to the particular state, or the best absolutely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to two magistracies of the highest rank, one they have a right to elect to, the other to fill; namely, the senate and the ephori.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is plain, then, that the most perfect political community must be amongst those who are in the middle rank, and those states are best instituted wherein these are a larger and more <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able part, if possible, than both the other; or, if that cannot be, at least than either of them separate; so that being thrown into the balance it may prevent either scale from preponderating.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We ought to consider as a proof of what I now <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>, that the best lawgivers themselves were those in the middle rank of life, amongst whom was Solon, as is evident from his poems, and Lycurgus, for he was not a king, and Charondas, and indeed most others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who made conquests in Greece, having all of them an eye to the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive forms of government in their own cities, established either democracies or oligarchies, not considering what was <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to the state, but what was similar to their own; for which reason a government has never been established where the supreme power has been placed amongst those of the middling rank, or very seldom; and, amongst a few, one man only of those who have yet been conquerors has been persuaded to give the preference to this order of [1296b] men: it is indeed an established custom with the inhabitants of most cities not to desire an equality, but either to aspire to govern, or when they are conquered, to submit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every legislator in framing his constitution ought to have a particular <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to those in the middle rank of life; and if he intends an oligarchy, these should be the object of his laws; if a democracy, to these they should be entrusted; and whenever their number exceeds that of the two others, or at least one of them, they give [1297a] stability to the constitution; for there is no fear that the rich and the poor should agree to conspire together against them, for neither of these will choose to serve the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their public assemblies, in having them open to all, but in fining the rich only, or others very little, for not attending; with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to offices, in permitting the poor to swear off, but not granting this indulgence to those who are within the census; with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their courts of justice, in fining the rich for non-attendance, but the poor not at all, or those a great deal, and these very little, as was done by the laws of Charondas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same spirit of legislation prevailed with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their bearing arms and their gymnastic exercises; for the poor are excused if they have no arms, but the rich are fined; the same method takes place if they do not attend their gymnastic exercises, there is no penalty on one, but there is on the other: the consequence of which is, that the fear of this penalty induces the rich to keep the one and attend the other, while the poor do neither.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The citizens of a free state ought to [1297b] consist of those only who bear arms: with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their census it is not easy to determine exactly what it ought to be, but the rule that should direct upon this subject should be to make it as extensive as possible, so that those who are enrolled in it make up a greater part of the people than those who are not; for those who are poor, although they partake not of the offices of the state, are willing to live quiet, provided that no one disturbs them in their property: but this is not an easy matter; for it may not always happen, that those who are at the head of public affairs are of a humane behaviour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XIV We will now proceed to make some general reflections upon the governments next in order, and also to consider each of them in particular; beginning with those principles which appertain to each: now there are three things in all states which a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful legislator ought well to consider, which are of great consequence to all, and which properly attended to the state must necessarily be happy; and according to the variation of which the one will differ from the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the power is in the hands of part of the community only, it is an oligarchy and this also admits of different customs; for whenever the officers of the state are chosen out of those who have a moderate fortune, and these from that circumstance are many, and when they depart not from that line which the law has laid down, but <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully follow it, and when all within the census are eligible, certainly it is then an oligarchy, but founded on true principles of government [1298b] from its moderation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XV We now proceed to consider the choice of magistrates; for this branch of public business contains many different Parts, as how many there shall be, what shall be their particular office, and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to time how long each of them shall continue in place; for some make it six months, others shorter, others for a year, others for a much longer time; or whether they should be perpetual or for a long time, or neither; for the same person may fill the same office several times, or he may not be allowed to enjoy it even twice, but only once: and also with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the appointment of magistrates, who are to be eligible, who is to choose them, and in what manner; for in all these particulars we ought properly to distinguish the different ways which may be followed; and then to show which of these is best suited to such and such governments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to speak <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is of no great consequence, nor is it the province of the judges to decide between those who dispute about words; it may indeed be an object of speculative <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>; but to inquire what officers are necessary in a state, and how many, and what, though not most necessary, may yet be advantageous in a well-established government, is a much more useful employment, and this with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to all states in general, as well as to small cities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it follows, that those who in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s are equal with others think it right to endeavour to partake of an equality with them in everything; and those who are superior to others endeavour to get still more; and it is this more which is the inequality: thus most states, though they have some notion of what is just, yet are almost totally wrong; and, upon this account, when either party has not that share in the administration which answers to his expectations, he becomes seditious: but those who of all others have the greatest right to be so are the last that are; namely, those who excel in virtue; for they alone can be called generally superior.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are, too, some persons of distinguished families who, because they are so, disdain to be on an equality with others, for those <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> themselves noble who boast of their ancestors' merit and fortune: these, to speak <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, are the origin and fountain from whence seditions arise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, all agree in what is absolutely and simply just; but, as we have already said they dispute concerning proportionate value; for some persons, if they are equal in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, think themselves equal in all; others, if they are superior in one thing, think they may claim the superiority in all; from whence chiefly arise two sorts of governments, a democracy and an oligarchy; for nobility and virtue are to be found only [1302a] amongst a few; the contrary amongst the many; there being in no place a hundred of the first to be met with, but enough of the last everywhere.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now that cause which of all others most universally inclines men to desire to bring about a change in government is that which I have already mentioned; for those who aim at equality will be ever ready for sedition, if they see those whom they <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> their equals possess more than they do, as well as those also who are not content with equality but aim at superiority, if they think that while they deserve more than, they have only equal with, or less than, their inferiors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Revolutions in state will also arise from a disproportionate increase; for as the body consists of many parts, it ought to increase proportion-ably to preserve its symmetry, which would otherwise be destroyed; as if the foot was to be four cubits long, and the rest of the body but two palms; it might otherwise [1303a] be changed into an animal of a different form, if it increase beyond proportion not only in quantity, but also in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of parts; so also a city consists of parts, some of which may often increase without notice, as the number of poor in democracies and free states.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Athens too the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the citizens is not the same, for those who live in the Piraeus are more attached to a popular government than those who live in the city properly so called; for as the interposition of a rivulet, however small, will occasion the line of the phalanx to fluctuate, so any trifling disagreement will be the cause of seditions; but they will not so soon flow from anything else as from the disagreement between virtue and vice, and next to that between poverty and riches, and so on in order, one cause having more influence than another; one of which that I last mentioned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, trifling quarrels are attended with the greatest consequences when they arise between persons of the first distinction in the state, as was the case with the Syracusians in a remote period; for a revolution in the government was brought about by a quarrel between two young men who were in office, upon a love affair; for one of them being absent, the other seduced his mistress; he in his turn, offended with this, persuaded his friend's wife to come and live with him; and upon this the whole city took part either with the one or the other, and the government was overturned: therefore every one at the beginning of such disputes ought to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to avoid the consequences; and to smother up all quarrels which may happen to arise amongst those in power, for the mischief lies in the beginning; for the beginning is said to be half of the business, so that what was then but a little fault will be found afterwards to bear its full proportion to what follows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Democracies will be most subject to revolutions from the dis<strong style='color: red'>honesty</strong> of their demagogues; for partly, by informing against men of property, they induce them to join together through self-defence, for a common fear will make the greatest enemies unite; and partly by setting the common people against them: and this is what any one may continually see practised in many states.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The demagogues, to curry favour with the people, drive the nobles to conspire together, either by dividing their estates, or obliging them to spend them on public <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, or by banishing them, that they may confiscate the fortunes of the wealthy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And when the judicial department is not in the hands of the supreme power, the demagogues, favouring the people in their causes, overturn the government; which happened at Heraclea in Pontus: and also when some desire to contract the power of the oligarchy into fewer hands; for those who endeavour to support an equality are obliged to apply to the people for <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An oligarchy is also subject to revolutions when the nobility spend their fortunes by luxury; for such persons are desirous of <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s, and either endeavour to be tyrants themselves or to support others in being so, as [1306a] Hypparinus supported Dionysius of Syracuse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But an aristocracy chiefly approaches to a secret change by its being destroyed by degrees, as we [1307b] have already said of all governments in general; and this happens from the cause of the alteration being trifling; for whenever anything which in the least <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the state is treated with contempt, after that something else, and this of a little more consequence, will be more easily altered, until the whole fabric of government is entirely subverted, which happened in the government of Thurium; for the law being that they should continue soldiers for five years, some young men of a martial <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, who were in great <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> amongst their officers, despising those who had the management of public affairs, and imagining they could easily accomplish their intention, first endeavoured to abolish this law, with a view of having it lawful to continue the same person perpetually in the military, perceiving that the people would readily appoint them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Upon this, the magistrates who are called counselors first joined together with an intention to oppose it but were afterwards induced to agree to it, from a belief that if that law was not repealed they would permit the management of all other public affairs to remain in their hands; but afterwards, when they endeavoured to restrain some fresh alterations that were making, they found that they could do nothing, for the whole form of government was altered into a dynasty of those who first introduced the <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In well-tempered governments it requires as much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> as anything whatsoever, that nothing be done contrary to law: and this ought chiefly to be attended to in matters of small consequence; for an illegality that approaches insensibly, approaches secretly, as in a family small expenses continually repeated consume a man's income; for the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing is deceived thereby, as by this false argument; if every part is little, then the whole is little: now, this in one sense is true, in another is false, for the whole and all the parts together are large, though made up of small parts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> ought also to be used to endeavour to restrain the quarrels and disputes of the nobles by laws, as well as to prevent those who are not already engaged in them from taking a part therein; for to perceive an evil at its very first approach is not the lot of every one, but of the politician.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, as many persons promote <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s, that they may enjoy their own particular manner of living, there ought to be a particular officer to inspect the manners of every one, and see that these are not contrary to the genius of the state in which he lives, whether it may be an oligarchy, a democracy, or any other form of government; and, for the same reason, those should be guarded against who are most prosperous in the city: the means of doing which is by appointing those who are otherwise to the business and the offices of the state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In an oligarchy it is necessary to take great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the poor, and allot them public employments which are gainful; and, if any of the rich insult them, to let their punishment be severer than if they insulted one of their own rank; and to let estates pass by affinity, and not gift: nor to permit any person to have more than one; for by this means property will be more equally divided, and the greater part of the poor get into better circumstances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in a democracy and an oligarchy to allot those who take no part in public affairs an equality or a preference in other things; the rich in a democracy, to the poor in an oligarchy: but still all the principal offices in the state to be filled only by those who are best qualified to discharge them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There may be some doubt, when all these qualifications do not in the same persons, in what manner the choice shall be made; as for instance, suppose that one person is an accomplished general, but a bad man and no friend to the [1309b] constitution; another is just and a friend to it, which shall one prefer? we should then consider of two qualities, which of them the generality possess in a greater degree, which in a less; for which reason in the choice of a general we should <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> his courage more than his virtue as the more uncommon quality; as there are fewer capable of conducting an army than there are good men: but, to protect the state or manage the finances, the contrary rule should be followed; for these require greater virtue than the generality are possessed of, but only that knowledge which is common to all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who think this the only virtue extend it to excess, not considering that as a nose which varies a little from perfect straightness, either towards a hook nose or a flat one, may yet be beautiful and agreeable to look at; but if this particularity is extended beyond measure, first of all the properties of the part is lost, but at last it can hardly be admitted to be a nose at all, on account of the excess of the rise or sinking: thus it is with other parts of the human body; so also the same thing is true with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to states; for both an oligarchy and a democracy may something vary from their most perfect form and yet be well constituted; but if any one endeavours to extend either of them too far, at first he will make the government the worse for it, but at last there will be no government at all remaining.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But of all things which I have mentioned, that which contributes most to preserve the state is, what is now most despised, to educate your children for the state; for the most useful laws, and most approved by every statesman, will be of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> if the citizens are not accustomed to and brought up in the principles of the constitution; of a democracy, if that is by law established; of an oligarchy, if that is; for if there are bad morals in one man, there are in the city.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But now the children of the magistrates in an oligarchy are brought up too delicately, and the children of the poor hardy with exercise and labour; so that they are both desirous of and able to promote <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A king desires to be the guardian of his people, that those who have property may be secure in the possession of it, and that the people in general meet with no injury; but a tyrant, as has been often said, has no <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the common good, except for his own advantage; his only object is pleasure, but a king's is virtue: what a tyrant therefore is ambitious of engrossing is wealth, but a king rather honour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of plots: some aim at the life of those who govern, others at their government; the first arises from hatred to their persons; which hatred may be owing to many causes, either of which will be sufficient to excite their anger, and the generality of those who are under the influence of that passion will join in a conspiracy, not for the sake of their own <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment, but for revenge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those also who are of a bold <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and have gained military honours amongst kings, will of all others be most like to engage in sedition; for strength and courage united inspire great bravery: whenever, therefore, these join in one person, he will be very ready for conspiracies, as he will easily conquer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt but the number of those who act upon this principle is small, for we must suppose they <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> their own safety as nothing in case they should not succeed, and must embrace the opinion of Dion (which few can do) when he made war upon Dionysius with a very few troops; for he said, that let the advantage he made be ever so little it would satisfy him to have gained it; and that, should it be his lot to die the moment he had gained footing in his country, he should think his death sufficiently glorious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dion made war against his relation Dionysius, and being <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ed by the people, first expelled and then killed him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Contempt also is often the cause of their destruction: for though, for instance, those who raised themselves to the supreme power generally preserved it; but those who received it from them have, to speak <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, almost immediately all of them lost it; for, falling into an effeminate way of life, they soon grew despicable, and generally fell victims to conspiracies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A kingdom, indeed, is not what we ever see erected in our times, but rather monarchies and tyrannies; for a kingly government is one that is voluntarily submitted to, and its supreme power admitted upon great occasions: but where many are equal, and there are none in any <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> so much better than another as to be qualified for the greatness and dignity of government over them, then these equals will not willingly submit to be commanded; but if any one assumes the government, either by force or fraud, this is a tyranny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What has been already mentioned is as conducive as anything can be to preserve a tyranny; namely, to keep down those who are of an aspiring <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, to take off those who will not submit, to allow no public meals, no clubs, no education, nothing at all, but to guard against everything that gives rise to high spirits or mutual confidence; nor to suffer the learned meetings of those who are at leisure to hold conversation with each other; and to endeavour by every means possible to keep all the people strangers to each other; for knowledge increases mutual confidence; and to oblige all strangers to appear in public, and to live near the city-gate, that all their actions may be sufficiently seen; for those who are kept like slaves seldom entertain any noble thoughts: in short, to imitate everything which the Persians and barbarians do, for they all contribute to support slavery; and to endeavour to know what every one who is under their power does and says; and for this purpose to employ spies: such were those women whom the Syracusians called potagogides Hiero also used to send out listeners wherever there was any meeting or conversation; for the people dare not speak with freedom for fear of such persons; and if any one does, there is the less chance of its being concealed; and to endeavour that the whole community should mutually accuse and come to blows with each other, friend with friend, the commons with the nobles, and the rich with each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But all these things may be comprehended in three divisions, for there are three objects which a tyranny has in view; one of which is, that the citizens should be of poor abject <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s; for such men never propose to conspire against any one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This, then, as the foundation, must be preserved: in other particulars <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully do and affect to seem like a king; first, appear to pay a great attention [1314b] to what belongs to the public; nor make such profuse presents as will offend the people; while they are to supply the money out of the hard labour of their own hands, and see it given in profusion to mistresses, foreigners, and fiddlers; keeping an exact account both of what you receive and pay; which is a practice some tyrants do actually follow, by which means they seem rather fathers of families than tyrants: nor need you ever fear the want of money while you have the supreme power of the state in your own hands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also much better for those tyrants who quit their kingdom to do this than to leave behind them money they have hoarded up; for their regents will be much less desirous of making <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong>s, and they are more to be dreaded by absent tyrants than the citizens; for such of them as he suspects he takes with him, but these regents must be left behind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He should also endeavour to appear to collect such taxes and require such <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s as the exigencies of the state demand, that whenever they are wanted they may be ready in time of war; and particularly to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that he appear to collect and keep them not as his own property, but the public's.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His appearance also should not be severe, but <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able, so that he should inspire those who approach him with <strong style='color: red'>veneration</strong> and not fear; but this will not be easily accomplished if he is despised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He should also take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> not to appear to be guilty of the least offence against <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>, nor to suffer it in those under him: nor to permit the women of his family to treat others haughtily; for the haughtiness of women has been the ruin of many tyrants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the pleasures of sense, he ought to do directly contrary to the practice of some tyrants at present; for they do not only continually indulge themselves in them for many days together, but they seem also to desire to have other witnesses of it, that they may <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> at their happiness; whereas he ought really to be moderate in these, and, if not, to appear to others to avoid them-for it is not the sober man who is exposed either to plots or contempt, but the drunkard; not the early riser, but the sluggard.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His conduct in general should also be contrary to what is reported of former tyrants; for he ought to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> and adorn his city, so as to seem a guardian and not a tyrant; and, moreover.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, always to [1315a] seem particularly attentive to the <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of the gods; for from persons of such a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> men entertain less fears of suffering anything illegal while they suppose that he who governs them is religious and <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>s the gods; and they will be less inclined to raise insinuations against such a one, as being peculiarly under their protection: but this must be so done as to give no occasion for any suspicion of hypocrisy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He should also take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to show such <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to men of merit in every particular, that they should not think they could be treated with greater distinction by their fellow-citizens in a free state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also a common protection of all monarchies not to make one person too great, or, certainly, not many; for they will support each other: but, if it is necessary to entrust any large powers to one person, to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that it is not one of an ardent spirit; for this <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> is upon every opportunity most ready for a revolution: and, if it should seem necessary to deprive any one of his power, to do it by degrees, and not reduce him all at once.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But of all persons who are most likely to entertain designs against the person of a tyrant, those are chiefly to be feared and guarded against who <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as nothing the loss of their own lives, so that they can but accomplish their purpose: be very <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful therefore of those who either think themselves affronted, or those who are dear to them; for those who are excited by anger to revenge <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as nothing their own persons: for, as Heraclitus says, it is dangerous to fight with an angry man who will purchase with his life the thing he aims at.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The tyranny of Orthagoras and his family at Sicyon, it is true, continued longer than any other: the reason for which was, that they used their power with moderation, and were in many particulars obedient to the laws; and, as Clisthenes was an able general, he never fell into contempt, and by the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> he took that in many particulars his government should be popular.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>: text is unintelligible here***] he conceives that nature will then produce bad men, who will not submit to education, and in this, probably, he is not wrong; for it is certain that there are some persons whom it is impossible by any education to make good men; but why should this change be more peculiar to what he calls the best-formed government, than to all other forms, and indeed to all other things that exist? and in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to his assigned time, as the cause of the alteration of all things, we find that those which did not begin to exist at the same time cease to be at the same time; so that, if anything came into beginning the day before the solstice, it must alter at the same time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to a tyranny he neither says whether there will be any change in it; or if not, to what cause it will be owing; or if there is, into what other state it will alter: but the reason of this is, that a tyranny is an indeterminate government; and, according to him, every state ought to alter into the first, and most perfect, thus the continuity and circle would be preserved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Be it so; but not entirely: but since a city happens to be made up of two different ranks of people, the rich and the poor, let that be established which is approved of by both these, or the greater part: but should there be opposite sentiments, let that be established which shall be approved of by the greater part: but let this be according to the census; for instance, if there should be ten of the rich and twenty of the poor, and six of the first and fifteen of the last should agree upon any measure, and the remaining four of the rich should join with the remaining five of the poor in opposing it, that party whose census when added together should determine which opinion should be law, and should these happen to be equal, it should be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a case similar to an assembly or court of justice dividing equally upon any <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> that comes before them, who either determine it by lot or some such method.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But although, with [1318b] <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to what is equal and just, it may be very difficult to establish the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, yet it is much easier to do than to persuade those who have it in their power to encroach upon others to be guided thereby; for the weak always desire what is equal and just, but the powerful pay no <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> thereunto.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see, then, that a democracy may be framed where the majority live by tillage or pasturage; for, as their property is but small, they will not be at leisure perpetually to hold public assemblies, but will be continually employed in following their own business, not having otherwise the means of living; nor will they be desirous of what another enjoys, but will rather like to follow their own business than meddle with state affairs and accept the offices of government, which will be attended with no great profit; for the major part of mankind are rather desirous of riches than honour (a proof of this is, that they submitted to the tyrannies in ancient times, and do now submit to the oligarchies, if no one hinders them in their usual occupations, or deprives them of their property; for some of them soon get rich, others are removed from poverty); besides, their having the right of election and calling their magistrates to account for their conduct when they come out of office, will satisfy their desire of honours, if any of them entertain that passion: for in some states, though the commonalty have not the right of electing the magistrates, yet it is vested in part of that body chosen to represent them: and it is sufficient for the people at large to possess the deliberative power: and this ought to be considered as a species of democracy; such was that formerly at Mantinsea: for which reason it is proper for the democracy we have been now treating of to have a power (and it has been usual for them to have it) of censuring their magistrates when out of office, and sitting in judgment upon all causes: but that the chief magistrates should be elected, and according to a certain census, which should vary with the rank of their office, or else not by a census, but according to their abilities for their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive appointments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They will be also <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to use their power with moderation, as there are others to whom full power is delegated to censure their conduct; for it is very <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to the state to have them dependent upon others, and not to be permitted to do whatsoever they choose; for with such a liberty there would be no check to that evil particle there is in every one: therefore it is [1319a] necessary and most for the benefit of the state that the offices thereof should be filled by the principal persons in it, whose <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are unblemished, and that the people are not oppressed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They ought, however, to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and do this no longer than the common people are superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank, and then stop; for, if they proceed still further, they will make the state disorderly, and the nobles will ill brook the power of the common people, and be full of resentment against it; which was the cause of an insurrection at Cyrene: for a little evil is overlooked, but when it becomes a great one it strikes the eye.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER V It is also the business of the legislator and all those who would support a government of this sort not to make it too great a work, or too perfect; but to aim only to render it stable: for, let a state be constituted ever so badly, there is no difficulty in its continuing a few days: they should therefore endeavour to procure its safety by all those ways which we have described in assigning the causes of the preservation and destruction of governments; avoiding what is hurtful, and by framing such laws, written and unwritten, as contain those things which chiefly tend to the preservation of the state; nor to suppose that that is useful either for a democratic or [1320a] an oligarchic form of government which contributes to make them more purely so, but what will contribute to their duration: but our demagogues at present, to flatter the people, occasion frequent confiscations in the courts; for which reason those who have the welfare of the state really at heart should act directly opposite to what they do, and enact a law to prevent forfeitures from being divided amongst the people or paid into the treasury, but to have them set apart for sacred uses: for those who are of a bad <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> would not then be the less cautious, as their punishment would be the same; and the community would not be so ready to condemn those whom they sat in judgment on when they were to get nothing by it: they should also take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the causes which are brought before the public should be as few as possible, and punish with the utmost severity those who rashly brought an action against any one; for it is not the commons but the nobles who are generally prosecuted: for in all things the citizens of the same state ought to be affectionate to each other, at least not to treat those who have the chief power in it as their enemies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whenever, then, the revenues of the state are small, there should be but few public assemblies and but few courts of justice: these, however, should have very extensive jurisdictions, but should continue sitting a few days only, for by this means the rich would not fear the expense, although they should receive nothing for their attendance, though the poor did; and judgment also would be given much better; for the rich will not choose to be long absent from their own affairs, but will willingly be so for a short time: and, when there are sufficient revenues, a different conduct ought to be pursued from what the demagogues at present follow; for now they divide the surplus of the public money amongst the poor; these receive it and again want the same supply, while the giving it is like pouring water into a sieve: but the true patriot in a democracy ought to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the majority of the community are not too poor, for this is the cause of rapacity in that government; he therefore should endeavour that they may enjoy perpetual plenty; and as this also is advantageous to the rich, what can be saved out of the public money should be put by, and then divided at once amongst the poor, if possible, in such a quantity as may enable every one of them to purchase a little field, and, if that cannot be done, at least to give each of them enough to procure the implements [1320b] of trade and husbandry; and if there is not enough for all to receive so much at once, then to divide it according to tribes or any other allotment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the meantime let the rich pay them for necessary <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, but not be obliged to find them in useless amusements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Much in the same manner ought that oligarchy to be established which is next in order: but as to that which is most opposite to a pure democracy, and approaches nearest to a dynasty and a tyranny, as it is of all others the worst, so it requires the greatest <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and caution to preserve it: for as bodies of sound and healthy constitutions and ships which are well manned and well found for sailing can bear many injuries without perishing, while a diseased body or a leaky ship with an indifferent crew cannot support the [1321a] least shock; so the worst-established governments want most looking after.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the magistrates of the highest rank which it may be necessary to have in a state, the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s they are bound to do the public should be expressly laid down, to prevent the common people from being desirous of accepting their employments, and also to induce them to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> their magistrates with favour when they know what a price they pay for their honours.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A second <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and nearly related to the first, is to have an eye both to the public and private edifices in the city, that they may be an ornament; and also to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of all buildings which are likely to fall: and to see that the highways are kept in proper repair; and also that the landmarks between different estates are preserved, that there may be no disputes on that account; and all other business of the same nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A third, which is very like the last, and conversant nearly about the same objects, only in the country, is to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of what is done out of the city.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Next to these is an officer whose business is of all others the most necessary, and yet most difficult; namely, to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that sentence is executed upon those who are condemned; and that every one pays the fines laid on him; and also to have the charge of those who are in prison.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1322a] This office is very disagreeable on account of the odium attending it, so that no one will engage therein without it is made very profitable, or, if they do, will they be willing to execute it according to law; but it is most necessary, as it is of no <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to pass judgment in any cause without that judgment is carried into execution: for without this human society could not subsist: for which reason it is best that this office should not be executed by one person, but by some of the magistrates of the other courts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In like manner, the taking <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that those fines which are ordered by the judges are levied should be divided amongst different persons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as different magistrates judge different causes, let the causes of the young be heard by the young: and as to those which are already brought to a hearing, let one person pass sentence, and another see it executed: as, for instance, let the magistrates who have the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the public buildings execute the sentence which the inspectors of the markets have passed, and the like in other cases: for by so much the less odium attends those who carry the laws into execution, by so much the easier will they be properly put in force: therefore for the same persons to pass the sentence and to execute it will subject them to general hatred; and if they pass it upon all, they will be considered as the enemies of all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus one person has often the custody of the prisoner's body, while another sees the sentence against him executed, as the eleven did at Athens: for which reason it is prudent to separate these offices, and to give great attention thereunto as equally necessary with anything we have already mentioned; for it will certainly happen that men of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> will decline accepting this office, and worthless persons cannot properly be entrusted with it, as having themselves rather an occasion for a guard than being qualified to guard others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These are they who have the guard of the city, and provide everything that is necessary for war; whose business it is, both in war and peace, to defend the walls and the gates, and to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to muster and marshal the citizens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These are nearly the civil magistrates which are requisite to a government: but there are other persons whose business is confined to religion; as the priests, and those who are to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the temples, that they are kept in proper repair, or, if they fall down, that they may be rebuilt; and whatever else belongs to public <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Next to these are those who are appointed to have the general <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of all those public sacrifices to the tutelar god of the state, which the laws do not entrust to the priests: and these in different states have different appellations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But separate states, who are peculiarly happy and have leisure to attend to more minute particulars, and are very attentive to good order, require particular magistrates for themselves; such as those who have the government of the women; who are to see the laws are executed; who take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the boys and preside over their education.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To these may be added those who have the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of their gymnastic exercises, [1323a] their theatres, and every other public spectacle which there may happen to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>BOOK VII CHAPTER I He who proposes to make that <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> which is necessary concerning what government is best, ought first to determine what manner of living is most eligible; for while this remains uncertain it will also be equally uncertain what government is best: for, provided no unexpected accidents interfere, it is highly probable, that those who enjoy the best government will live the most happily according to their circumstances; he ought, therefore, first to know what manner of life is most desirable for all; and afterwards whether this life is the same to the man and the citizen, or different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As I imagine that I have already sufficiently shown what sort of life is best in my popular discourses on that subject, I think I may very properly repeat the same here; as most certainly no one ever called in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> the propriety of one of the divisions; namely, that as what is good, relative to man, may be divided into three sorts, what is external, what appertains to the body, and what to the soul, it is evident that all these must conspire to make a man happy: for no one would say that a man was happy who had no fortitude, no temperance, no justice, no prudence; but was afraid of the flies that flew round him: nor would abstain from the meanest theft if he was either hungry or dry, or would murder his dearest friend for a farthing; and also was in every particular as wanting in his <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing as an infant or an idiot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s are so evident that all must agree to them; though some may dispute about the quantity and the degree: for they may think, that a very little virtue is sufficient for happiness; but for riches, property, power, honour, and all such things, they endeavour to increase them without bounds: but to such we reply, that it is easy to prove from what experience teaches us in these cases, that these external goods produce not virtue, but virtue them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to a happy life, whether it is to be found in pleasure or virtue or both, certain it is, that those whose morals are most pure, and whose <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ings are best cultivated, will enjoy more of it, although their fortune is but moderate than those do who own an exuberance of wealth, are deficient in those; and this utility any one who reflects may easily convince himself of; for whatsoever is external has its boundary, as a machine, and whatsoever is useful in its excess is either necessarily hurtful, or at best useless to the possessor; but every good quality of the soul the higher it is in degree, so much the more useful it is, if it is permitted on this subject to use the word useful as well as noble.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also very evident, that the accidents of each subject take place of each other, as the subjects themselves, of which we allow they are accidents, differ from each other in value; so that if the soul is more noble than any outward possession, as the body, both in itself and with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to us, it must be admitted of course that the best accidents of each must follow the same analogy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus much by way of introduction; for I could not but just touch upon this subject, though I could not go through a complete investigation of it, as it properly belongs to another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>: let us at present suppose so much, that a man's happiest life, both as an individual and as a citizen, is a life of virtue, accompanied with those enjoyments which virtue usually procures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER II It now remains for us to say whether the happiness of any individual man and the city is the same or different: but this also is evident; for whosoever supposes that riches will make a person happy, must place the happiness of the city in riches if it possesses them; those who prefer a life which enjoys a tyrannic power over others will also think, that the city which has many others under its command is most happy: thus also if any one approves a man for his virtue, he will think the most worthy city the happiest: but here there are two particulars which require <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, one of which is, whether it is the most eligible life to be a member of the community and enjoy the rights of a citizen, or whether to live as a stranger, without interfering in public affairs; and also what form of government is to be preferred, and what <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the state is best; whether the whole community should be eligible to a share in the administration, or only the greater part, and some only: as this, therefore, is a subject of political examination and speculation, and not what concerns the individual, and the first of these is what we are at present engaged in, the one of these I am not obliged to speak to, the other is the proper business of my present design.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And yet it is of no little consequence on which side the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> lies; for a man of sense must naturally incline to the better choice; both as an individual and a citizen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Probably it may seem too absurd to those who are willing to take this subject into their <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> to inquire whether it is the business of a legislator to be able to point out by what means a state may govern and tyrannise over its neighbours, whether they will, or will not: for how can that belong either to the politician or legislator which is unlawful? for that cannot be lawful which is done not only justly, but unjustly also: for a conquest may be unjustly made.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of a good legislator to examine <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully into his state; and the nature of the people, and how they may partake of every intercourse, of a good life, and of the happiness which results from it: and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> some laws and customs differ from others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of a legislator, if he has any neighbouring states to consider in what manner he shall oppose each of them, or what good offices he shall show them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From what we have already determined on this subject, some one probably may think, that supreme power is of all things best, as that will enable a man to command very many useful <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s from others; so that he who can obtain this ought not to give it up to another, but rather to seize it: and, for this purpose, the father should have no attention or <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the son, or the son for the father, or friend for friend; for what is best is most eligible: but to be a member of the community and be in felicity is best.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What these persons <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> might probably be true, if the supreme good was certainly theirs who plunder and use violence to others: but it is [1325b] most unlikely that it should be so; for it is a mere supposition: for it does not follow that their actions are honourable who thus assume the supreme power over others, without they were by nature as superior to them as a man to a woman, a father to a child, a master to a slave: so that he who so far forsakes the paths of virtue can never return back from whence he departed from them: for amongst equals whatever is fair and just ought to be reciprocal; for this is equal and right; but that equals should not partake of what is equal, or like to like, is contrary to nature: but whatever is contrary to nature is not right; therefore, if there is any one superior to the rest of the community in virtue and abilities for active life, him it is proper to follow, him it is right to obey, but the one alone will not do, but must be joined to the other also: and, if we are right in what we have now said, it follows that happiness consists in virtuous activity, and that both with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the community as well as the individual an active life is the happiest: not that an active life must necessarily refer to other persons, as some think, or that those studies alone are practical which are pursued to teach others what to do; for those are much more so whose final object is in themselves, and to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the judgment and <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of the man; for virtuous activity has an end, therefore is something practical; nay, those who contrive the plan which others follow are more particularly said to act, and are superior to the workmen who execute their designs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, as it belongs to the first to direct the inferior magistrates and to act as judges, it follows that they can neither determine causes with justice nor issue their orders with propriety without they know the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of their fellow-citizens: so that whenever this happens not to be done in these two particulars, the state must of necessity be badly managed; for in both of them it is not right to determine too hastily and without proper knowledge, which must evidently be the case where the number of the citizens is too many: besides, it is more easy for strangers and sojourners to assume the rights of citizens, as they will easily escape detection in so great a multitude.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether we have done right or wrong in fixing this limit to the territory shall be considered more minutely hereafter, when we come particularly to inquire into property, and what fortune is requisite for a man to live on, and how and in what manner they ought to employ it; for there are many doubts upon this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, while each party insists upon their own plan of life being carried to an excess, the one of severity, the other of indulgence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What the situation of the country should be it is not difficult to determine, in some particulars <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing that we ought to be advised by those who are skilful in military affairs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to the position of the city, if one could place it to one's wish, it is convenient to fix it on the seaside: with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the country, one situation which it ought to have has been already mentioned, namely, that it should be so placed as easily to give <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance to all places, and also to receive the necessaries of life from all parts, and also wood, or any other materials which may happen to be in the country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VI But with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to placing a city in the neighbourhood of the sea, there are some who have many doubts whether it is <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able or hurtful to a well-regulated state; for they say, that the resort of persons brought up under a different system of government is dis<strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to the state, as well by impeding the laws as by their numbers; for a multitude of merchants must necessarily arise from their trafficking backward and forward upon the seas, which will hinder the well-governing of the city: but if this inconvenience should not arise, it is evident that it is better, both on account of safety and also for the easier acquisition of the necessaries of life, that both the city and the country should be near the sea; for it is necessary that those who are to sustain the attack of the enemy should be ready with their <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance both by land and by sea, and to oppose any inroad, both ways if possible but if not, at least where they are most powerful, which they may do while they possess both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to a naval power, it is by no means doubtful that it is necessary to have one to a certain degree; and this not only for the sake of the [1327b] city itself, but also because it may be necessary to appear formidable to some of the neighbouring states, or to be able to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> them as well by sea as by land; but to know how great that force should be, the health of the state should be inquired into, and if that appears vigorous and enables her to take the lead of other communities, it is necessary that her force should correspond with her actions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VII We now proceed to point out what natural <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> the members of the community ought to be of: but this any one will easily perceive who will cast his eye over the states of Greece, of all others the most celebrated, and also the other different nations of this habitable world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who live in cold countries, as the north of Europe, are full of courage, but wanting in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing and the arts: therefore they are very tenacious of their liberty; but, not being politicians, they cannot reduce their neighbours under their power: but the Asiatics, whose <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ings are quick, and who are conversant in the arts, are deficient in courage; and therefore are always conquered and the slaves of others: but the Grecians, placed as it were between these two boundaries, so partake of them both as to be at the same time both courageous and sensible; for which reason Greece continues free, and governed in the best manner possible, and capable of commanding the whole world, could they agree upon one system of policy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to what some persons say, that the military must be mild and tender to those they know, but severe and cruel to those they know not, it is courage which [1328a] makes any one lovely; for that is the faculty of the soul which we most admire: as a proof of this, our resentment rises higher against our friends and acquaintance than against those we know not: for which reason Archilaus accusing his friends says very properly to himself, Shall my friends insult me? The spirit of freedom and command also is what all inherit who are of this <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> for courage is commanding and invincible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It also is not right for any one to say, that you should be severe to those you know not; for this behaviour is proper for no one: nor are those who are of a noble <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> harsh in their manners, excepting only to the wicked; and when they are particularly so, it is, as has been already said, against their friends, when they think they have injured them; which is agreeable to reason: for when those who think they ought to receive a favour from any one do not receive it, beside the injury done them, they consider what they are deprived of: hence the saying, "Cruel are the wars of brothers;" and this, "Those who have greatly loved do greatly hate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" And thus we have nearly determined how many the inhabitants of a city ought to be, and what their natural <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and also the country how large, and of what sort is necessary; I say nearly, because it is needless to endeavour at as great accuracy in those things which are the objects of the senses as in those which are inquired into by the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing only.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are now to consider what those things are without which a city cannot possibly exist; for what we call parts of the city must of necessity inhere in it: and this we shall plainly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, if we know the number of things necessary to a city: first, the inhabitants must have food: secondly, arts, for many instruments are necessary in life: thirdly, arms, for it is necessary that the community should have an armed force within themselves, both to support their government against those of their own body who might refuse obedience to it, and also to defend it from those who might attempt to attack it from without: fourthly, a certain revenue, as well for the internal necessities of the state as for the business of war: fifthly, which is indeed the chief concern, a religious establishment: sixthly in order, but first of all in necessity, a court to determine both criminal and civil causes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since we are inquiring what is the best government possible, and it is admitted to be that in which the citizens are happy; and that, as we have already said, it is impossible to obtain happiness without virtue; it follows, that in the best-governed states, where the citizens are really men of intrinsic and not relative goodness, none of them should be permitted to exercise any mechanic employment or follow merchandise, as being ignoble and destructive to virtue; neither should they be husband-[1329a] men, that they may be at leisure to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> in virtue and perform the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> they owe to the state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the employments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidently necessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons, or shall the same person execute both? This <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, too, is easily answered: for in some cases the same persons may execute them, in others they should be different, where the different employments require different abilities, as when courage is wanting for one, judgment for the other, there they should be allotted to different persons; but when it is evident, that it is impossible to oblige those who have arms in their hands, and can insist on their own terms, to be always under command; there these different employments should be trusted to one person; for those who have arms in their hands have it in their option whether they will or will not assume the supreme power: to these two (namely, those who have courage and judgment) the government must be entrusted; but not in the same manner, but as nature directs; what requires courage to the young, what requires judgment to the old; for with the young is courage, with the old is wisdom: thus each will be allotted the part they are fit for according to their different merits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There remains of the different classes of the people whom we have enumerated, the priests, for these evidently compose a rank by themselves; for neither are they to be reckoned amongst the husbandmen nor the mechanics; for <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> to the gods is highly becoming every state: and since the citizens have been divided into orders, the military and the council, and it is proper to offer due <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> to the gods, and since it is necessary that those who are employed in their <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> should have nothing else to do, let the business of the priesthood be allotted to those who are in years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As we ought to think that most other things were found out in a long, nay, even in a boundless time (reason teaching us that want would make us first invent that which was necessary, and, when that was obtained, then those things which were requisite for the conveniences and ornament of life), so should we conclude the same with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to a political state; now everything in Egypt bears the marks of the most remote antiquity, for these people seem to be the most ancient of all others, and to have acquired laws and political order; we should therefore make a proper use of what is told us of them, and endeavour to find out what they have omitted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The expense also of religious <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> should be defrayed by the whole state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Of necessity therefore the land ought to be divided into two parts, one of which should belong to the community in general, the other to the individuals separately; and each of these parts should again be subdivided into two: half of that which belongs to the public should be appropriated to maintain the <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of the gods, the other half to support the common meals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Half of that which belongs to the individuals should be at the extremity of the country, the other half near the city, so that these two portions being allotted to each person, all would partake of land in both places, which would be both equal and right; and induce them to act in concert with greater harmony in any war with their neighbours: for when the land is not divided in this manner, one party neglects the inroads of the enemy on the borders, the other makes it a matter of too much consequence and more than is necessary; for which reason in some places there is a law which forbids the inhabitants of the borders to have any vote in the council when they are debating upon a war which is made against them as their private interest might prevent their voting <strong style='color: red'>impartial</strong>ly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Could one have one's choice, the husbandmen should by all means be slaves, not of the same nation, or men of any spirit; for thus they would be laborious in their business, and safe from attempting any novelties: next to these barbarian servants are to be preferred, similar in natural <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> to these we have already mentioned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In what manner these slaves ought to be used, and for what reason it is very proper that they should have the promise of their liberty made them, as a reward for their <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, shall be mentioned hereafter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are these four things which we should be particularly desirous of in the position of the city with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to itself: in the first place, health is to be consulted as the first thing necessary: now a city which fronts the east and receives the winds which blow from thence is <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed most healthful; next to this that which has a northern position is to be preferred, as best in winter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> should be taken of the health of the inhabitants, the first thing to be attended to is, that the city should have a good situation and a good position; the second is, that they may have good water to drink; and this not be negligently taken <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of; for what we chiefly and most frequently use for the support of the body must principally influence the health of it; and this influence is what the air and water naturally have: for which reason in all wise governments the waters ought to be appropriated to different purposes, and if they are not equally good, and if there is not a plenty of necessary water, that which is to drink should be separated from that which is for other uses.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to walls, those who say that a courageous people ought not to have any, pay too much <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to obsolete notions; particularly as we may see those who pride themselves therein continually confuted by facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this is true, it is not only necessary to have walls, but <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> must be taken that they may be a proper ornament to the city, as well as a defence in time of war; not only according to the old methods, but the modern <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments also: for as those who make offensive war endeavour by every way possible to gain advantages over their adversaries, so should those who are upon the defensive employ all the means already known, and such new ones as philosophy can invent, to defend themselves: for those who are well prepared are seldom first attacked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to temples for public <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong>, and the hall for the public tables of the chief magistrates, they ought to be built in proper places, and contiguous to each other, except those temples which the law or the oracle orders to be separate from all other buildings; and let these be in such a conspicuous eminence, that they may have every advantage of situation, and in the neighbourhood of that part of the city which is best fortified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also proper, that for performing these exercises the citizens should be divided into distinct classes, according to their ages, and that the young persons should have proper officers to be with them, and that the seniors should be with the magistrates; for having them before their eyes would greatly inspire true <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> and ingenuous fear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now it is evident that all persons are desirous to live well and be happy; but that some have the means thereof in their own power, others not; and this either through nature [1332a] or fortune; for many ingredients are necessary to a happy life; but fewer to those who are of a good than to those who are of a bad <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, other animals live chiefly a life of nature; and in very few things according to custom; but man lives according to reason also, which he alone is endowed with; wherefore he ought to make all these accord with each other; for if men followed reason, and were persuaded that it was best to obey her, they would act in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s contrary to nature and custom.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, if one man differed from another as much, as we believe, the gods and heroes differ from men: in the first place, being far their superiors in body; and, secondly, in the soul: so that the superiority of the governors over the governed might be evident beyond a doubt, it is certain that it would be better for the one always to govern, the other always to be governed: but, as this is not easy to obtain, and kings are not so superior to those they govern as Scylax informs us they are in India, it is evident that for many reasons it is necessary that all in their turns should both govern and be governed: for it is just that those who are equal should have everything alike; and it is difficult for a state to continue which is founded in injustice; for all those in the country who are desirous of <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong> will apply themselves to those who are under the government of the rest, and such will be their numbers in the state, that it will be impossible for the magistrates to get the better of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this it will be first said, that nature herself has directed us in our choice, laying down the selfsame thing when she has made some young, others old: the first of whom it becomes to obey, the latter to command; for no one when he is young is offended at his being under government, or thinks himself too good for it; more especially when he considers that he himself shall receive the same honours which he pays when he shall arrive at a proper age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it must be acknowledged that the governors and the governed are the same, in others they are different; it is therefore necessary that their education should be in [1333a] some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> the same, in others different: as they say, that he will be a good governor who has first learnt to obey.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Reason itself also is divided into two parts, in the manner we usually divide it; the theoretic and the practical; which division therefore seems necessary for this part also: the same analogy holds good with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to actions; of which those which are of a superior nature ought always to be chosen by those who have it in their power; for that is always most eligible to every one which will procure the best ends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This also is ridiculous, that while they preserved an obedience to their laws, and no one opposed their being governed by them, they lost the means of being honourable: but these people <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> not rightly what sort of government it is which ought to reflect honour on the legislator; for a government of freemen is nobler than despotic power, and more consonant to virtue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rendering a people fit for war, that they may enslave their inferiors ought not to be the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the legislator; but that they may not themselves be reduced to slavery by others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In [1334a] the next place, he should take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the object of his government is the safety of those who are under it, and not a despotism over all: in the third place, that those only are slaves who are fit to be only so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The body, therefore, necessarily demands our <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> before the soul; next the appetites for the sake of the mind; the body for the sake of the soul.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER XVI If then the legislator ought to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that the bodies of the children are as perfect as possible, his first attention ought to be given to matrimony; at what time and in what situation it is proper that the citizens should engage in the nuptial contract.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this alliance, the legislator ought both to consider the parties and their time of life, that they may grow old at the same part of time, and that their bodily powers may not be different; that is to say, the man being able to have children, but the woman too old to bear them; or, on the contrary, the woman be young enough to produce children, but the man too old to be a father; for from such a situation discords and disputes continually arise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the next place, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the succession of children, there ought not to be too great an interval of time between them and their parents; for when there is, the parent can receive no benefit from his child's affection, or the child any advantage from his father's protection; [1335a] neither should the difference in years be too little, as great inconveniences may arise from it; as it prevents that proper <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> being shown to a father by a boy who considers him as nearly his equal in age, and also from the disputes it occasions in the economy of the family.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, to return from this digression, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> ought to be taken that the bodies of the children may be such as will answer the expectations of the legislator; this also will be affected by the same means.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It also prevents the bodies of men from acquiring their full size if they marry before their growth is completed; for this is the determinate period, which prevents any further increase; for which reason the proper time for a woman to marry is eighteen, for a man thirty-seven, a little more or less; for when they marry at that time their bodies are in perfection, and they will also cease to have children at a proper time; and moreover with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the succession of the children, if they have them at the time which may reasonably be expected, they will be just arriving into perfection when their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The married couple ought also to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the precepts of physicians and naturalists, each of whom have treated on these [1335b] subjects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What is the fit <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the body will be better mentioned when we come to speak of the education of the child; we will just slightly mention a few particulars.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Women with child should also take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that their diet is not too sparing, and that they use sufficient exercise; which it will be easy for the legislator to effect if he commands them once every day to repair to the <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of the gods who are supposed to preside over matrimony.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, contrary to what is proper for the body, the mind ought to be kept as tranquil as possible; for as plants partake of the nature of the soil, so does the child receive much of the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the mother.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the exposing or bringing up of children, let it be a law, that nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up,.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to any connection between a man and a woman, or a woman and a man, when either of the parties are betrothed, let it be held in utter detestation [1336a] on any pretext whatsoever; but should any one be guilty of such a thing after the marriage is consummated, let his infamy be as great as his guilt deserves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now whoever will examine into the nature of animals, and also observe those people who are very desirous their children should acquire a warlike habit, will find that they feed them chiefly with milk, as being best accommodated to their bodies, but without wine, to prevent any distempers: those motions also which are natural to their age are very <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able; and to prevent any of their limbs from being crooked, on account of their extreme ductility, some people even now use particular machines that their bodies may not be distorted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also useful to enure them to the cold when they are very little; for this is very <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able for their health; and also to enure them to the business of war; for which reason it is customary with many of the barbarians to dip their children in rivers when the water is cold; with others to clothe them very slightly, as among the Celts; for whatever it is possible to accustom children to, it is best to accustom them to it at first, but to do it by degrees: besides, boys have naturally a habit of loving the cold, on account of the heat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their governors and preceptors also should take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> what sort of tales and stories it may be proper for them to hear; for all these ought to pave the way for their future instruction: for which reason the generality of their play should be imitations of what they are afterwards to do seriously.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The preceptors also ought to have an eye upon their manner of life, and those with whom they converse; and to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that they are never in the company of slaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since we forbid his speaking everything which is forbidden, it is necessary that he neither sees obscene stories nor pictures; the magistrates therefore are to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that there are no statues or pictures of anything of this nature, except only to those gods to whom the law permits them, and to which the law allows persons of a certain age to pay their devotions, for themselves, their wives, and children.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have at present just touched upon this subject; it will be our business hereafter, when we properly come to it, to determine whether this <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of children is unnecessary, or, if necessary, in what manner it must be done; at present we have only mentioned it as necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are two periods into which education ought to be divided, according to the age of the child; the one is from his being seven years of age to the time of puberty; the other from thence till he is one-and-twenty: for those who divide ages by the number seven [1337a] are in general wrong: it is much better to follow the division of nature; for every art and every instruction is intended to complete what nature has left defective: we must first consider if any regulation whatsoever is requisite for children; in the next place, if it is advantageous to make it a common <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, or that every one should act therein as he pleases, which is the general practice in most cities; in the third place, what it ought to be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>BOOK VIII CHAPTER I No one can doubt that the magistrate ought greatly to interest himself in the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of youth; for where it is neglected it is hurtful to the city, for every state ought to be governed according to its particular nature; for the form and manners of each government are peculiar to itself; and these, as they originally established it, so they usually still preserve it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As there is one end in view in every city, it is evident that education ought to be one and the same in each; and that this should be a common <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and not the individual's, as it now is, when every one takes <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of his own children separately; and their instructions are particular also, each person teaching them as they please; but what ought to be engaged in ought to be common to all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides, no one ought to think that any citizen belongs to him in particular, but to the state in general; for each one is a part of the state, and it is the natural <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of each part to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the good of the whole: and for this the Lacedaemonians may be praised; for they give the greatest attention to education, and make it public.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER II What education is, and how children ought to be instructed, is what should be well known; for there are doubts concerning the business of it, as all people do not agree in those things they would have a child taught, both with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in virtue and a happy life: nor is it clear whether the object of it should be to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the reason or rectify the morals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the present mode of education we cannot determine with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> to which men incline, whether to instruct a child in what will be useful to him in life; or what tends to virtue, and what is excellent: for all these things have their separate defenders.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to virtue, there is no particular [1337b] in which they all agree: for as all do not equally <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> all virtues, it reasonably follows that they will not cultivate the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every work is to be <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed mean, and every art and every discipline which renders the body, the mind, or the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of freemen unfit for the habit and practice of virtue: for which reason all those arts which tend to deform the body are called mean, and all those employments which are exercised for gain; for they take off from the freedom of the mind and render it sordid.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As it is evident whether a boy should be first taught morals or reasoning, and whether his body or his <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing should be first cultivated, it is plain that boys should be first put under the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the different masters of the gymnastic arts, both to form their bodies and teach them their exercises.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER IV Now those states which seem to take the greatest <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of their children's education, bestow their chief attention on wrestling, though it both prevents the increase of the body and hurts the form of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fault the Lacedaemonians did not fall into, for they made their children fierce by painful labour, as chiefly useful to inspire them with courage: though, as we have already often said, this is neither the only thing nor the principal thing necessary to attend to; and even with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this they may not thus attain their end; for we do not find either in other animals, or other nations, that courage necessarily attends the most cruel, but rather the milder, and those who have the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s of lions: for there are many people who are eager both to kill men and to devour human flesh, as the Achaeans and Heniochi in Pontus, and many others in Asia, some of whom are as bad, others worse than these, who indeed live by tyranny, but are men of no courage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that those who permit boys to engage too earnestly in these exercises, while they do not take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to instruct them in what is necessary to do, to speak the real <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, render them mean and vile, accomplished only in one <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of a citizen, and in every other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, as reason evinces, good for nothing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER V With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to music we have already spoken a little in a doubtful manner upon this subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It will be proper to go over again more particularly what we then said, which may serve as an introduction to what any other person may choose to offer thereon; for it is no easy matter to distinctly point out what power it has, nor on what accounts one should apply it, whether as an amusement and refreshment, as sleep or wine; as these are nothing serious, but pleasing, and the killers of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, as Euripides says; for which reason they class in the same order and use for the same purpose all these, namely, sleep, wine, and music, to which some add dancing; or shall we rather suppose that music tends to be productive of virtue, having a power, as the gymnastic exercises have to form the body in a certain way, to influence the manners so as to accustom its professors to rejoice rightly? or shall we say, that it is of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in the conduct of life, and an <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant to prudence? for this also is a third property which has been attributed to it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now that boys are not to be instructed in it as play is evident; for those who learn don't play, for to learn is rather troublesome; neither is it proper to permit boys at their age to enjoy perfect leisure; for to cease to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> is by no means fit for what is as yet imperfect; but it may be thought that the earnest attention of boys in this art is for the sake of that amusement they will enjoy when they come to be men and completely formed; but, if this is the case, why are they themselves to learn it, and not follow the practice of the kings of the Medes and Persians, who enjoy the pleasure of music by hearing others play, and being shown its beauties by them; for of necessity those must be better skilled therein who make this science their particular study and business, than those who have only spent so much time at it as was sufficient just to learn the principles of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education? and of those three things which have been assigned as its proper employment, which is the right? Is it to instruct, to amuse, or to employ the vacant hours of those who live at rest? or may not all three be properly allotted to it? for it appears to partake of them all; for play is necessary for relaxation, and relaxation pleasant, as it is a medicine for that uneasiness which arises from labour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That music should be pursued, not on this account only, but also as it is very <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able during the hours of relaxation from labour, probably no [1340a] one doubts; we should also inquire whether besides this use it may not also have another of nobler nature--and we ought not only to partake of the common pleasure arising from it (which all have the sensation of, for music naturally gives pleasure, therefore the use of it is agreeable to all ages and all <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s); but also to examine if it tends anything to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> our manners and our souls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And this will be easily known if we feel our <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s any way influenced thereby; and that they are so is evident from many other instances, as well as the music at the Olympic games; and this confessedly fills the soul with enthusiasm; but enthusiasm is an affection of the soul which strongly agitates the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But anger and mildness, courage and <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>, and their contraries, as well as all other <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s of the mind, are most naturally imitated by music and poetry; which is plain by experience, for when we hear these our very soul is altered; and he who is affected either with joy or grief by the imitation of any objects, is in very nearly the same situation as if he was affected by the objects themselves; thus, if any person is pleased with seeing a statue of any one on no other account but its beauty, it is evident that the sight of the original from whence it was taken would also be pleasing; now it happens in the other senses there is no imitation of manners; that is to say, in the touch and the taste; in the objects of sight, a very little; for these are merely representations of things, and the perceptions which they excite are in a manner common to all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in poetry and music there are imitations of manners; and this is evident, for different harmonies differ from each other so much by nature, that those who hear them are differently affected, and are not in the same <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of mind when one is performed as when another is; the one, for instance, occasions grief 13406 and contracts the soul, as the mixed Lydian: others soften the mind, and as it were dissolve the heart: others fix it in a firm and settled state, such is the power of the Doric music only; while the Phrygian fills the soul with enthusiasm, as has been well described by those who have written philosophically upon this part of education; for they bring examples of what they <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> from the things themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same holds true with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to rhythm; some fix the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, others occasion a change in it; some act more violently, others more liberally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From what has been said it is evident what an influence music has over the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the mind, and how variously it can fascinate it: and if it can do this, most certainly it is what youth ought to be instructed in.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And indeed the learning of music is particularly adapted to their <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; for at their time of life they do not willingly attend to anything which is not agreeable; but music is naturally one of the most agreeable things; and there seems to be a certain connection between harmony and rhythm; for which reason some wise men held the soul itself to be harmony; others, that it contains it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That children may learn music properly, it is necessary that they should not be employed in those parts of it which are the objects of dispute between the masters in that science; nor should they perform such pieces as are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed at from the difficulty of their execution; and which, from being first exhibited in the public games, are now become a part of education; but let them learn so much of it as to be able to receive proper pleasure from excellent music and rhythms; and not that only which music must make all animals feel, and also slaves and boys, but more.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What the ancients tell us, by way of fable, of the flute is indeed very rational; namely, that after Minerva had found it, she threw it away: nor are they wrong who say that the goddess disliked it for deforming the face of him who played thereon: not but that it is more probable that she rejected it as the knowledge thereof contributed nothing to the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of the mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, we <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> Minerva as the inventress of arts and sciences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As we disapprove of a child's being taught to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> instruments, and to play like a master (which we would have confined to those who are candidates for the prize in that science; for they play not to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> themselves in virtue, but to please those who hear them, and gratify their importunity); therefore we think the practice of it unfit for freemen; but then it should be confined to those who are paid for doing it; for it usually gives people sordid notions, for the end they have in view is bad: for the impertinent spectator is accustomed to make them change their music; so that the artists who attend to him regulate their bodies according to his motions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER VII We are now to enter into an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> concerning harmony and rhythm; whether all sorts of these are to be employed in education, or whether some peculiar ones are to be selected; and also whether we should give the same directions to those who are engaged in music as part of education, or whether there is something different from these two.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1342a] It is evident that all harmonies are to be used; but not for all purposes; but the most moral in education: but to please the ear, when others play, the most active and enthusiastic; for that passion which is to be found very strong in some souls is to be met with also in all; but the difference in different persons consists in its being in a less or greater degree, as pity, fear, and enthusiasm also; which latter is so powerful in some as to overpower the soul: and yet we see those persons, by the application of sacred music to soothe their mind, rendered as sedate and composed as if they had employed the art of the physician: and this must necessarily happen to the <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>ate, the fearful, and all those who are subdued by their passions: nay, all persons, as far as they are affected with those passions, admit of the same cure, and are restored to tranquillity with pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, that the dithyrambic measure is Phrygian is allowed by general consent; and those who are conversant in studies of this sort bring many proofs of it; as, for instance, when Philoxenus endeavoured to compose dithyrambic music for Doric harmony, he naturally fell back again into Phrygian, as being fittest for that purpose; as every one indeed agrees, that the Doric music is most serious, and fittest to inspire courage: and, as we always commend the middle as being between the two extremes, and the Doric has this relation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other harmonies, it is evident that is what the youth ought to be instructed in.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are two things to be taken into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, both what is possible and what is proper; every one then should chiefly endeavour to attain those things which contain both these qualities: but this is to be regulated by different times of life; for instance, it is not easy for those who are <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in years to sing such pieces of music as require very high notes, for nature points out to them those which are gentle and require little strength of voice (for which reason some who are skilful in music justly find fault with Socrates for forbidding the youth to be instructed in gentle harmony; as if, like wine, it would make them drunk, whereas the effect of that is to render men bacchanals, and not make them languid): these therefore are what should employ those who are grown old.</li>
