<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not only was the constitution at this time oligarchical in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, but the poorer classes, men, women, and children, were the serfs of the rich.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Council of Areopagus had as its constitutionally assigned <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> the protection of the laws; but in point of fact it administered the greater and most important part of the government of the state, and inflicted personal punishments and fines summarily upon all who misbehaved themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In connexion with it some persons try to traduce the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Solon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It so happened that, when he was about to enact the Seisachtheia, he communicated his intention to some members of the upper class, whereupon, as the partisans of the popular party say, his friends stole a march on him; while those who wish to attack his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> maintain that he too had a share in the fraud himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A proof that Solon regulated the elections to office according to the property classes may be found in the law still in force with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Treasurers, which enacts that they shall be chosen from the Pentacosiomedimni.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such was Solon's legislation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the nine Archons; whereas in early times the Council of Areopagus summoned suitable persons according to its own <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> and appointed them for the year to the several offices.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Each tribe was divided into three Trittyes [=Thirds], with twelve Naucraries in each; and the Naucraries had officers of their own, called Naucrari, whose <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> it was to superintend the current receipts and expenditure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Solon also appointed a Council of four hundred, a hundred from each tribe; but he assigned to the Council of the Areopagus the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of superintending the laws, acting as before as the guardian of the constitution in general.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 11 When he had completed his organization of the constitution in the manner that has been described, he found himself beset by people coming to him and harassing him concerning his laws, criticizing here and <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ing there, till, as he wished neither to alter what he had decided on nor yet to be an object of ill will to every one by remaining in Athens, he set off on a journey to Egypt, with the combined objects of trade and travel, giving out that he should not return for ten years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 12 The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this view of Solon's policy is established alike by common consent, and by the mention he has himself made of the matter in his poems.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The names given to the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive parties were derived from the districts in which they held their lands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when all his words availed nothing he carried forth his armour and set it up in front of his house, saying that he had <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed his country so far as lay in his power (he was already a very old man), and that he called on all others to do the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The latter drove in on a chariot with the woman beside him, and the inhabitants of the city, struck with <strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>, received him with adoration.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this he had the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance of many allies, notably the Thebans and Lygdamis of Naxos, and also the Knights who held the supreme power in the constitution of Eretria.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not only was he in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> humane and mild and ready to forgive those who offended, but, in addition, he <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d money to the poorer people to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> them in their labours, so that they might make their living by agriculture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The man spoke without knowing who his <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>er was; but Pisistratus was so leased with his frank speech and his industry that he granted him exemption from all taxes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But most important of all in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> was his popular and kindly <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The majority alike of the upper class and of the people were in his favour; the former he won by his social intercourse with them, the latter by the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance which he gave to their private purses, and his nature fitted him to win the hearts of both.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It will not harmonize with their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive ages, as any one may see who will reckon up the years of the life of each of them, and the dates at which they died.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 18 Hippias and Hipparchus assumed the control of affairs on grounds alike of standing and of age; but Hippias, as being also naturally of a statesmanlike and shrewd <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, was really the head of the government.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hipparchus was youthful in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, amorous, and fond of literature (it was he who invited to Athens Anacreon, Simonides, and the other poets), while Thessalus was much junior in age, and was violent and headstrong in his behaviour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was from his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that all the evils arose which befell the house.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having failed, then, in very other method, they took the contract for rebuilding the temple at Delphi, thereby obtaining ample funds, which they employed to secure the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of the Lacedaemonians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then, being roused to anger by this disaster, they sent their king, Cleomenes, by land at the head of a larger force; and he, after defeating the Thessalian cavalry when they attempted to intercept his march into Attica, shut up Hippias within what was known as the Pelargic wall and blockaded him there with the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance of the Athenians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But even earlier than the attempts of the Alcmeonidae, one Cedon made an attack on the tyrants; when there came another popular drinking song, addressed to him: Pour a health yet again, boy, to Cedon; forget not this <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to do, If a health is an honour befitting the name of a good man and true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Three years later, however, in the archonship of Hypsichides, all the ostracized persons were recalled, on account of the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of the army of Xerxes; and it was laid down for the future that persons under sentence of ostracism must live between Geraestus and Scyllaeum, on pain of losing their civic rights irrevocably.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He pointed out to them that all would be able to gain a living there, some by <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in the army, others in the garrisons, others by taking a part in public affairs; and in this way they would secure the leadership.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this revolution he was <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ed by Themistocles, who was himself a member of the Areopagus, but was expecting to be tried before it on a charge of treasonable dealings with Persia.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The soldiers for active <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> were selected at that time from the roll of citizens, and as the generals were men of no military experience, who owed their position solely to their family standing, it continually happened that some two or three thousand of the troops perished on an expedition; and in this way the best men alike of the lower and the upper classes were exhausted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, forty-eight years after the battle of Salamis, in the archonship of Pythodorus, the Peloponnesian war broke out, during which the populace was shut up in the city and became accustomed to gain its livelihood by military <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and so, partly voluntarily and partly involuntarily, determined to assume the administration of the state itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pericles was also the first to institute pay for <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in the law-courts, as a bid for popular favour to counterbalance the wealth of Cimon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The latter, having private possessions on a regal scale, not only performed the regular public <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s magnificently, but also maintained a large number of his fellow-demesmen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any member of the deme of Laciadae could go every day to Cimon's house and there receive a reasonable provision; while his estate was guarded by no fences, so that any one who liked might <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> himself to the fruit from it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some critics accuse him of thereby causing a deterioration in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the juries, since it was always the common people who put themselves forward for selection as jurors, rather than the men of better position.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to Nicias and Thucydides, nearly every one agrees that they were not merely men of birth and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but also statesmen, and that they ruled the state with paternal <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Next they abolished all indictments for illegal proposals, all impeachments and pubic prosecutions, in order that every Athenian should be free to give his counsel on the situation, if he chose; and they decreed that if any person imposed a fine on any other for his acts in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, or prosecuted him or summoned him before the courts, he should, on an information being laid against him, be summarily arrested and brought before the generals, who should deliver him to the Eleven to be put to death.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the future, four Councils were to be created, of men of the age already mentioned, and one of these was to be chosen by lot to take office at once, while the others were to receive it in turn, in the order decided by the lot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They were to administer that office as seemed to them best, both with reference to the safe custody and due expenditure of the finances, and generally with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to all other matters to the best of their ability.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If they desired to take a larger number of persons into counsel, each member might call in one <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant of his own choice, subject to the same qualification of age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The chief promoters of the revolution were Pisander, Antiphon, and Theramenes, all of them men of good birth and with high reputations for ability and <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Accordingly the popular party tried to preserve the democracy, while that part of the upper class which belonged to the political clubs, together with the exiles who had returned since the peace, aimed at an oligarchy, and those who were not members of any club, though in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s they considered themselves as good as any other citizens, were anxious to restore the ancient constitution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon, however, as they were masters of the city, they ignored all the resolutions which had been passed relating to the organization of the constitution, but after appointing a Council of Five Hundred and the other magistrates out of a thousand selected candidates, and associating with themselves ten Archons in Piraeus, eleven superintendents of the prison, and three hundred 'lash-bearers' as attendants, with the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of these they kept the city under their own control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But so soon as they had got a firmer hold on the city, they spared no class of citizens, but put to death any persons who were eminent for wealth or birth or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Theramenes, however, criticized this scheme also, first on the ground that, while proposing to give all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able citizens a share in the constitution, they were actually giving it only to three thousand persons, as though all merit were confined within that number; and secondly because they were doing two inconsistent things, since they made the government rest on the basis of force, and yet made the governors inferior in strength to the governed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They introduced two laws into the Council, which they commanded it to pass; the first of them gave the Thirty absolute power to put to death any citizen who was not included in the list of the Three Thousand, while the second disqualified all persons from participation in the franchise who should have <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ed in the demolition of the fort of Eetioneia, or have acted in any way against the Four Hundred who had organized the previous oligarchy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Theramenes having been thus removed, they disarmed all the people except the Three Thousand, and in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> showed a great <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> in cruelty and crime.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They also sent ambassadors to Lacedaemonian to blacken the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Theramenes and to ask for <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>; and the Lacedaemonians, in answer to their appeal, sent Callibius as military governor with about seven hundred troops, who came and occupied the Acropolis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, however, the Ten had taken over the government they did nothing towards the object for which they were elected, but sent envoys to Lacedaemonian to ask for <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> and to borrow money.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Under their administration, and with their active and zealous <strong style='color: red'>cooperation</strong>, the treaty of reconciliation was made and the populace returned to the city.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If any of the seceding party wished to take a house in Eleusis, the people would <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> them to obtain the consent of the owner; but if they could not come to terms, they should appoint three valuers on either side, and the owner should receive whatever price they should appoint.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This they did because they thought it was a necessary first step in the direction of restoring harmony; but in other states, so far from the democratic parties making <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s from their own possessions, they are rather in the habit of making a general redistribution of the land.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fourth was the tyranny of Pisistratus; the fifth the constitution of Cleisthenes, after the overthrow of the tyrants, of a more democratic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than that of Solon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then if they decide that he is not a free man, he appeals to the law-courts, and the demesmen appoint five of their own number to act as accusers; if the court decides that he has no right to be enrolled, he is sold by the state as a slave, but if he wins his case he has a right to be enrolled among the demesmen without further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For these two years they are on garrison <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, and wear the military cloak, and during this time they are exempt from all taxes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is also their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to draw up the programme of the business of the Council and to decide what subjects are to be dealt with on each particular da, and where the sitting is to be held.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the sixth prytany, in addition to the business already stated, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is put to the vote whether it is desirable to hold a vote of ostracism or not; and complaints against professional accusers, whether Athenian or aliens domiciled in Athens, are received, to the number of not more than three of either class, together with cases in which an individual has made some promise to the people and has not performed it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two remaining meetings are devoted to all other subjects, and the laws require them to deal with three <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s connected with religion, three connected with heralds and embassies, and three on secular subjects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sometimes <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s are brought forward without a preliminary vote of the Assembly to take them into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There has, however, to be a preliminary <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> by the Council in this case also.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Accordingly a trial was held in a law-court, and Lysimachus was acquitted, receiving henceforth the nickname of 'the man from the drum-head'; and the people deprived the Council thenceforward of the power to inflict death or imprisonment or fine, passing a law that if the Council condemn any person for an offence or inflict a fine, the Thesmothetae shall bring the sentence or fine before the law-court, and the decision of the jurors shall be the final <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> in the matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Council passes <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> on nearly all magistrates, especially those who have the control of money; its <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong>, however, is not final, but is subject to an appeal to the lawcourts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It takes, however, preliminary cognizance of all matters brought before the Assembly, and the Assembly cannot vote on any <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> unless it has first been considered by the Council and placed on the programme by the Prytanes; since a person who carries a motion in the Assembly is liable to an action for illegal proposal on these grounds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They also elect one Examiner of Accounts (Euthunus) by lot from each tribe, with two assessors (Paredri) for each examiner, whose <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> it is to sit at the ordinary market hours, each opposite the statue of the eponymous hero of his tribe; and if any one wishes to prefer a charge, on either public or private grounds, against any magistrate who has passed his audit before the law-courts, within three days of his having so passed, he enters on a whitened tablet his own name and that of the magistrate prosecuted, together with the malpractice that is alleged against him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then, if the Thesmothetae accept it, they bring the accounts of this magistrate once more before the law-court, and the decision of the jury stands as the final <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If a man who has a good horse is found to keep it in bad condition, he is mulcted in his allowance of corn; while those which cannot keep up or which shy and will not stand steady, it brands with a wheel on the jaw, and the horse so marked is disqualified for <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It also inspects those who appear to be fit for <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> as scouts, and any one whom it rejects is deprived of his horse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If any of those who have been on the roll previously make affidavit that they are physically incapable of cavalry <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, they strike them out; then they call up the persons newly enrolled, and if any one makes affidavit that he is either physically or pecuniarily incapable of cavalry <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> they dismiss him, but if no such affidavit is made the Council vote whether the individual in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is suitable for the purpose or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> is to see that female flute-and harp-and lute-players are not hired at more than two drachmas, and if more than one person is anxious to hire the same girl, they cast lots and hire her out to the person to whom the lot falls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their statutory <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> is to see that all articles offered for sale in the market are pure and unadulterated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are ten Superintendents of the Mart, elected by lot, whose <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> is to superintend the Mart, and to compel merchants to bring up into the city two-thirds of the corn which is brought by sea to the Corn Mart.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 52 The Eleven also are appointed by lot to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the prisoners in the state gaol.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, or where a man desirous of setting up business in the market has borrowed from another man capital to start with; also cases of slander, cases arising out of friendly loans or <strong style='color: red'>partnership</strong>s, and cases concerned with slaves, cattle, and the office of trierarch, or with banks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are two classes of Eponymi, the ten who give their names to the tribes, and the forty-two of the years of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then the Forty take the last of the Eponymi of the years of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and assign the arbitrations to the persons belonging to that year, casting lots to determine which arbitrations each shall undertake; and every one is compelled to carry through the arbitrations which the lot assigns to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These are the only persons who escape the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Eponymi are also used in reference to military expeditions; when the men of military age are despatched on <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, a notice is put up stating that the men from such-and such an Archon and Eponymus to such-and such another Archon and Eponymus are to go on the expedition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 54 The following magistrates also are elected by lot: Five Commissioners of Roads (Hodopoei), who, with an assigned body of public slaves, are required to keep the roads in order: and ten Auditors, with ten <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants, to whom all persons who have held any office must give in their accounts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Assembly also elects by open vote a clerk to read documents to it and to the Council; but he has no other <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> except that of reading aloud.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Assembly also elects by lot the Commissioners of Public Worship (Hieropoei) known as the Commissioners for Sacrifices, who offer the sacrifices appointed by oracle, and, in conjunction with the seers, take the auspices whenever there is occasion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the examiner has put these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, he proceeds, 'Call the witnesses to these facts'; and when the candidate has produced his witnesses, he next asks, 'Does any one wish to make any accusation against this man?' If an accuser appears, he gives the parties an opportunity of making their accusation and defence, and then puts it to the Council to pass the candidate or not, and to the law-court to give the final vote.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this stone the Archons stand, and swear to execute their office uprightly and according to the laws, and not to receive presents in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the performance of their duties, or, if they do, to dedicate a golden statue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The suits and indictments which come before him, and which he, after a preliminary <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, brings up before the lawcourts, are as follows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Archon also has the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of orphans and wards of state, and of women who, on the death of their husbands, declare themselves to be with child; and he has power to inflict a fine on those who offend against the persons under his charge, or to bring the case before the law-courts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to receive these cases and divide them into ten groups, and assign to each tribe the group which comes to it by lot; after which the magistrates who introduce cases for the tribe hand them over to the Arbitrators.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All indictments also come before them in which a deposit has to be made by the prosecutor, namely, indictments for concealment of foreign origin, for corrupt evasion of foreign origin (when a man escapes the disqualification by bribery), for blackmailing accusations, bribery, false entry of another as a state debtor, false testimony to the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> of a summons, conspiracy to enter a man as a state debtor, corrupt removal from the list of debtors, and adultery.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The casting of lots for the jurors is conducted by all the nine Archons, with the clerk to the Thesmothetae as the tenth, each performing the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> for his own tribe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 61 All officers connected with military <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> are elected by open vote.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The appointment of these officers is submitted for confirmation in each prytany, when the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is put whether they are considered to be doing their <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Generals have full power, when on active <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, to arrest any one for insubordination, or to cashier him publicly, or to inflict a fine; the latter is, however, unusual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They have the same powers as the Generals have in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of the infantry, and their appointments are also subject to confirmation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pay is received for the following <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As he enters, he receives a voucher from the official to whom this <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> has been assigned by lot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The public servants carry the chests from each tribe, one to each court, containing the names of the members of the tribe who are in that court, and hand them over to the officials assigned to the <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of giving back their tickets to the jurors in each court, so that these officials may call them up by name and pay them their fee.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The magistrate whose name is first drawn is thereupon proclaimed by the crier as assigned for <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> in the court which is first drawn, and the second in the second, and similarly with the rest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the jurors have come in, and have been assigned to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive courts, the presiding magistrate in each court draws one ticket out of each chest (making ten in all, one out of each tribe), and throws them into another empty chest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is to prevent any tampering beforehand with either the superintendent of the clock or the tellers of the votes, and to secure that there is no malpractice in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The five who have not been selected for these duties receive from them a statement of the order in which the jurors shall receive their fees, and of the places where the several tribes shall <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively gather in the court for this purpose when their duties are completed; the object being that the jurors may be broken up into small groups for the reception of their pay, and not all crowd together and impede one another.</li>
