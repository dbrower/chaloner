<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so, having taken these three from nature as (so to speak) laws of it, we make further use of the number three in the <strong style='color: red'>worship</strong> of the Gods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore, since 'every' and 'all' and 'complete' do not differ from one another in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of form, but only, if at all, in their matter and in that to which they are applied, body alone among magnitudes can be complete.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We could pass beyond it only in virtue of a defect in it; and that which is complete cannot be defective, since it has being in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the whole of which they are parts must necessarily be complete, and thus, in accordance with the meaning of the word, have being, not in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> only, but in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 2 The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as to the nature of the whole, whether it is infinite in size or limited in its total mass, is a matter for subsequent <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may take it that all movement is either natural or unnatural, and that the movement which is unnatural to one body is natural to another-as, for instance, is the case with the upward and downward movements, which are natural and unnatural to fire and earth <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For alteration is movement in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of quality; and qualitative states and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s, such as health and disease, do not come into being without changes of properties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For all men have some conception of the nature of the gods, and all who believe in the existence of gods at all, whether barbarian or Greek, agree in allotting the highest place to the deity, surely because they suppose that immortal is linked with immortal and <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> any other supposition as inconceivable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The mere evidence of the senses is enough to convince us of this, at least with human <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For concave and convex are a not only <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as opposed to one another, but they are also coupled together and treated as a unity in opposition to the straight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the motion is the same as that along the diameter, since we invariably <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the distance between two points as the length of the straight line which joins them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor again can motion along the circle from A to B be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as the contrary of motion from A to C: for the motion goes from the same point towards the same point, and contrary motion was distinguished as motion from a contrary to its contrary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 5 This being clear, we must go on to consider the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which remain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>First, is there an infinite body, as the majority of the ancient philosophers thought, or is this an impossibility? The decision of this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, either way, is not unimportant, but rather all-important, to our search for the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it has been and so it must be; since the least initial deviation from the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is multiplied later a thousandfold.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Admit, for instance, the existence of a minimum magnitude, and you will find that the minimum which you have introduced, small as it is, causes the greatest <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>s of mathematics to totter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the conception of the infinite possesses this power of principles, and indeed in the sphere of quantity possesses it in a higher degree than any other conception; so that it is in no way absurd or unreasonable that the assumption that an infinite body exists should be of peculiar moment to our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is clear, further, that if the simple bodies are finite, the composite must also be finite, since that which is composed of bodies finite both in number and in magnitude is itself finite in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of number and magnitude: its quantity is in fact the same as that of the bodies which compose it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The body which moves in a circle must necessarily be finite in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, for the following reasons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(4) Again, as a line which has a limit cannot be infinite, or, if it is infinite, is so only in length, so a surface cannot be infinite in that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> in which it has a limit; or, indeed, if it is completely determinate, in any <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> whatever.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor, if there were, would it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That there is no infinite body may be shown, as we have shown it, by a detailed <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the various cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it may also be shown universally, not only by such reasoning as we <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in our discussion of principles (though in that passage we have already determined universally the sense in which the existence of an infinite is to be asserted or denied), but also suitably to our present purpose in the following way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That will lead us to a further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> might possibly be raised whether there is any obstacle to our believing that there are other universes composed on the pattern of our own, more than one, though stopping short of infinity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this is not possible, if we are to hold to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of our original presuppositions and to the view that neither that which moves downward, nor, by the same reasoning, that which moves upward, can prolong its movement to infinity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For it is true in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to quality, quantity, and place alike that any process of change is impossible which can have no end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may also be examined in the light of more general <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s as follows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 8 We must now proceed to explain why there cannot be more than one heaven-the further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> mentioned above.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the other kinds of movement also makes it plain that there is some point to which earth and fire move naturally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of these points, then, gives adequate assurance of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of our contentions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is plain, too, from the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s that the universe must be one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have now said enough to make plain the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and number of the bodily elements, the place of each, and further, in general, how many in number the various places are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now since the universe is perceptible it must be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a particular; for everything that is perceptible subsists, as we know, in matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>First, however, we must explain what we mean by 'heaven' and in how many senses we use the word, in order to make clearer the object of our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further neither can any body come into that place: for it will do so either naturally or unnaturally, and will be either simple or composite; so that the same argument will apply, since it makes no difference whether the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is 'does A exist?' or 'could A come to exist?' From our arguments then it is evident not only that there is not, but also that there could never come to be, any bodily mass whatever outside the circumference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 10 Having established these distinctions, we may now proceed to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the heaven is ungenerated or generated, indestructible or destructible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall be less open to the charge of procuring <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> by default.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To give a satisfactory decision as to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> it is necessary to be rather an arbitrator than a party to the dispute.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now to assert that it was generated and yet is eternal is to assert the impossible; for we cannot reasonably attribute to anything any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics but those which observation detects in many or all instances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They say that in their statements about its generation they are doing what geometricians do when they construct their figures, not implying that the universe really had a beginning, but for didactic reasons facilitating <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing by exhibiting the object, like the figure, as in course of formation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that if the totality of body, which is a continuum, is now in this order or <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and now in that, and if the combination of the whole is a world or heaven, then it will not be the world that comes into being and is destroyed, but only its <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) So far as the heaven is concerned we have answered this view with arguments appropriate to the nature of the heaven: on the general <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we shall attain clearness when we examine the matter universally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is the ground of the predication will always remain obscure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the same way the word 'generated' is used, (a) first, where what formerly was not afterwards is, whether a process of becoming was or was not involved, so long as that which then was not, now is; (b) secondly, of anything capable of existing, 'capable' being defined with reference either to <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> or to facility; (c) thirdly, of anything to which the passage from not being to being belongs, whether already actual, if its existence is due to a past process of becoming, or not yet actual but only possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in things of that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> the contradictory states proceed from one and the same capacity, the matter of the thing being the cause equally of its existence and of its non-existence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considerations also not general like these but proper to the subject show it to be impossible that what was formerly eternal should later be destroyed or that what formerly was not should later be eternal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>---------------------------------------------------------------------- BOOK II Part 1 That the heaven as a whole neither came into being nor admits of destruction, as some assert, but is one and eternal, with no end or beginning of its total duration, containing and embracing in itself the infinity of time, we may convince ourselves not only by the arguments already set forth but also by a <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of the views of those who differ from us in providing for its generation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it is well to persuade oneself of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the ancient and truly traditional theories, that there is some immortal and divine thing which possesses movement, but movement such as has no limit and is rather itself the limit of all other movement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If then, as we said, the view already stated of the first motion is a possible one, it is not only more appropriate so to conceive of its eternity, but also on this hypothesis alone are we able to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> a theory consistent with popular divinations of the divine nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference is sometimes only one of function, sometimes also one of shape; and while the distinction of above and below is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of all animate things, whether plants or animals, that of right and left is not found in plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, in addition, above is the region from which movement originates, right the region in which it starts, front the region to which it is directed, then on this ground too above has a certain original <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as compared with the other forms of position.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We need not be troubled by the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, arising from the spherical shape of the world, how there can be a distinction of right and left within it, all parts being alike and all for ever in motion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must think of the world as of something in which right differs from left in shape as well as in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, which subsequently is included in a sphere.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, then, is not the whole body of the heaven of the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as that part? Because there must be something at rest at the centre of the revolving body; and of that body no part can be at rest, either elsewhere or at the centre.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further, it is inconceivable that a movable body should be eternal, if its movement cannot be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as naturally eternal: and these bodies we know to possess movement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further, those who divide bodies into planes and generate them out of planes seem to bear witness to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The criticism, however, is not always just: one should first consider what reason there is for speaking, and also what kind of <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> is looked for, whether human merely or of a more cogent kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When any one shall succeed in finding proofs of greater <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, gratitude will be due to him for the discovery, but at present we must be content with a probable solution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The incapacities of animals, age, decay, and the like, are all unnatural, due, it seems, to the fact that the whole animal complex is made up of materials which differ in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of their proper places, and no single part occupies its own place.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For such movement would be infinite and indefinite, but every movement, in our view, proceeds from one point to another and is definite in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But not only is the explanation evident; it is also a corroboration of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the views we have <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is as though nature had foreseen the result, that if their movement were other than it is, nothing on this earth could maintain its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 10 With their order-I mean the position of each, as involving the priority of some and the posteriority of others, and their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive distances from the extremity-with this astronomy may be left to deal, since the astronomical discussion is adequate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This discussion shows that the movements of the several stars depend, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the varieties of speed which they exhibit, on the distance of each from the extremity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 11 With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the shape of each star, the most reasonable view is that they are spherical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 12 There are two difficulties, which may very reasonably here be raised, of which we must now attempt to state the probable solution: for we <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the zeal of one whose thirst after philosophy leads him to accept even slight indications where it is very difficult to see one's way, as a proof rather of <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> than of overconfidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why is it that the primary motion includes such a multitude of stars that their whole array seems to defy counting, while of the other stars each one is separated off, and in no case do we find two or more attached to the same motion? On these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, I say, it is well that we should seek to increase our <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing, though we have but little to go upon, and are placed at so great a distance from the facts in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless there are certain principles on which if we base our <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> we shall not find this difficulty by any means insoluble.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to the difficulty that into the one primary motion is crowded a vast multitude of stars, while of the other stars each has been separately given special movements of its own, there is in the first place this reason for <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing the arrangement as a natural one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In thinking of the life and moving principle of the several heavens one must <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the first as far superior to the others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of the stars which move with a circular motion, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of substance and shape, movement and order, have now been sufficiently explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 13 It remains to speak of the earth, of its position, of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether it is at rest or in motion, and of its shape.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Most people-all, in fact, who <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the whole heaven as finite-say it lies at the centre.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As to the position of the earth, then, this is the view which some <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>, and the views <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d concerning its rest or motion are similar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difficulty then, has naturally passed into a common place of philosophy; and one may well <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that the solutions offered are not seen to involve greater absurdities than the problem itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s some have been led to assert that the earth below us is infinite, saying, with Xenophanes of Colophon, that it has 'pushed its roots to infinity',-in order to save the trouble of seeking for the cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is what we are all inclined to do, to direct our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> not by the matter itself, but by the views of our opponents: and even when interrogating oneself one pushes the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> only to the point at which one can no longer offer any opposition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence a good inquirer will be one who is ready in bringing forward the objections proper to the genus, and that he will be when he has gained an <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of all the differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is absurd too not to perceive that, while the whirling movement may have been responsible for the original coming together of the art of earth at the centre, the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> remains, why now do all heavy bodies move to the earth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rather that movement caused the pre-existent heavy and light things to go to the middle and stay on the surface <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 14 Let us first decide the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> whether the earth moves or is at rest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Further, the natural movement of the earth, part and whole alike, is the centre of the whole-whence the fact that it is now actually situated at the centre-but it might be <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed since both centres are the same, which centre it is that portions of earth and other heavy things move to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s then it is clear that the earth does not move and does not lie elsewhere than at the centre.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only they attribute the downward movement to constraint, and it is better to keep to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and say that the reason of this motion is that a thing which possesses weight is naturally endowed with a centripetal movement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A short <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> will give us an easy answer, if we first give <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong> to our postulate that any body endowed with weight, of whatever size, moves towards the centre.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the earth was generated, then, it must have been formed in this way, and so clearly its generation was spherical; and if it is ungenerated and has remained so always, its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> must be that which the initial generation, if it had occurred, would have given it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As further evidence in favour of this they quote the case of elephants, a species occurring in each of these extreme regions, suggesting that the common <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of these extremes is explained by their continuity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is obvious, then, that the greater part of the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into nature concerns bodies: for a natural substance is either a body or a thing which cannot come into existence without body and magnitude.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This appears plainly from an analysis of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of natural things, and equally from an inspection of the instances of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is indeed the first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we have to ask: is generation a fact or not? Earlier speculation was at variance both with itself and with the views here put forward as to the true answer to this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There may be things not subject to generation or any kind of movement, but if so they belong to another and a higher <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> than the study of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this last theory which composes every body of planes is, as the most superficial observation shows, in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s in plain contradiction with mathematics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to natural bodies there are impossibilities involved in the view which asserts indivisible lines, which we may briefly consider at this point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For how, except by the merest fiction, can they specify the number and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the parts which will produce weight? And, further, when one weight is greater than another, the difference is a third weight; from which it will follow that every indivisible part possesses weight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A further <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> is that if time is similarly constituted, there would be, or might be, a time at which it was done away with.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And if their movement was natural, a moment's <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> shows that there was already an ordered world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is a further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, too, which might be asked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dividing the heavy body in the proportion CE:CD, we subtract from the heavy body a part which will in the same time move the distance CE, since the whole moved CD: for the relative speeds of the two bodies will be in inverse ratio to their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive sizes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the natural movement of a body may be <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed on in the same way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since in every case knowledge depends on what is primary, and the elements are the primary constituents of bodies, we must ask which of such bodies are elements, and why; and after that what is their number and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For though it will be either flesh or bone or something else, that does not at once show that it contained these in potentiality: the further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> remains, in what manner it becomes them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 4 The next <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to consider is whether the elements are finite or infinite in number, and, if finite, what their number is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This method of distinction makes all <strong style='color: red'>judgement</strong> relative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The principle of distinction between bodies being quantity, the various sizes will be in a definite ratio, and whatever bodies are in this ratio to one another must be air, fire, earth, and water <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Others, again, express no opinion on the subject of its figure, but simply <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> it as the of the finest parts, which in combination will form other bodies, as the fusing of gold-dust produces solid gold.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For (1) if, on the one hand, they make the primary body an atom, the view will be open to the objections already <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d against the atomic theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And further the theory is inconsistent with a <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for the facts of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 6 First we must inquire whether the elements are eternal or subject to generation and destruction; for when this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> has been answered their number and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> will be manifest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 7 We must, therefore, turn to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, what is the manner of their generation from one another? Is it as Empedocles and Democritus say, or as those who resolve bodies into planes say, or is there yet another possibility? (1) What the followers of Empedocles do, though without observing it themselves, is to reduce the generation of elements out of one another to an illusion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, in the first place, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to movement both are in error.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our first business, then, will be to speak of these, and that <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> will enable us to explain the differences of each from each.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s is a proper part of the theory of movement, since we call things heavy and light because they have the power of being moved naturally in a certain way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But because the <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> into nature is concerned with movement, and these things have in themselves some spark (as it were) of movement, all inquirers avail themselves of these powers, though in all but a few cases without exact discrimination.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must then first look at whatever others have said, and formulate the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which require settlement in the interests of this <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, before we go on to state our own view of the matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 2 Those of our predecessors who have entered upon this <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> have for the most part spoken of light and heavy things only in the sense in which one of two things both endowed with weight is said to be the lighter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This, however, will become clearer as we <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those who maintain that the primary or atomic parts, of which bodies endowed with weight are composed, are planes, cannot so speak without absurdity; but those who <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> them as solids are in a better position to assert that of such bodies the larger is the heavier.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, how will they discriminate the absolutely heavy? Presumably, either by its excess of solid or by its defect of void.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, however, it is the nature of a void to move upward and of a plenum to move downward, and therefore each causes a like movement in other things, there was no need to raise the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> why composite bodies are some light and some heavy; they had only to explain why these two things are themselves light and heavy <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, and to give, further, the reason why the plenum and the void are not eternally separated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 3 These, then, are the views which have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by others and the terms in which they state them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may begin our own statement by settling a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which to some has been the main difficulty-the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> why some bodies move always and naturally upward and others downward, while others again move both upward and downward.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The local movement of each body into its own place must be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as similar to what happens in connexion with other forms of generation and change.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are, in fact, three kinds of movement, affecting <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively the size, the form, and the place of a thing, and in each it is observable that change proceeds from a contrary to a contrary or to something intermediate: it is never the change of any chance subject in any chance direction, nor, similarly, is the relation of the mover to its object fortuitous: the thing altered is different from the thing increased, and precisely the same difference holds between that which produces alteration and that which produces increase.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Thus to ask why fire moves upward and earth downward is the same as to ask why the healable, when moved and changed qua healable, attains health and not whiteness; and similar <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s might be asked concerning any other subject of aletion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I use the term 'absolutely', in view of the generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of 'light' and 'heavy', in order to confine the application to bodies which do not combine lightness and heaviness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now other bodies are severally light and heavy, and evidently in them the attributes are due to the difference of their uncompounded parts: that is to say, according as the one or the other happens to preponderate the bodies will be heavy and light <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is due to the properties of the elementary bodies that a body which is <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as light in one place is <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as heavy in another, and vice versa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether it is really the centre of the earth and not rather that of the whole to which it moves, may be left to another <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, since these are coincident.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The same holds, consequently, also of the matter itself of that which is heavy and light: as potentially possessing the one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, it is matter for the heavy, and as potentially possessing the other, for the light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bodies composed of kinds of matter different from these but having relatively to each other the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which these have absolutely, possess both the upward and the downward motion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And so, either there will be no absolutely light body, if superiority of weight is due to superior size or number of the constituent bodies or to the fullness of the body: but the contrary is a matter of observation, and it has been shown that the downward and upward movements are equally constant and universal: or, if the matter in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is the void or something similar, which moves uniformly upward, there will be nothing to move uniformly downward.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to these <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, it is wrong to accept the explanation offered by Democritus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s apply with far greater force to air, since it is so much more easily divided than water.</li>
