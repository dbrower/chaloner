<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reader {2} will, I think, find this plan a convenience, for, if he does not doubt the conclusion or <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> about the details, he can easily pass them over; yet I may be permitted to say that some of the discussions thus printed deserve attention, at least from the professed naturalist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1] This is the more desirable, as it is impossible in the present work to avoid many allusions to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which will be fully discussed in future volumes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man {4} may select and preserve each successive variation, with the distinct intention of improving and altering a breed, in accordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up variations, often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he has effected <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful changes and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the will of man thus comes into play, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants and pleasures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can further <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that domestic races of animals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, as compared with natural species; for they have been modified not for their own benefit, but for that of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This problem of the conversion of varieties into species,--that is, the augmentation of the slight differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of varieties into the greater differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of species and genera, including the admirable adaptations of each being to its complex organic and inorganic conditions of life,--will form the main subject of my second work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The term "natural selection" is in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed after a little familiarity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall, also, see that the continued production of new forms through natural selection, which implies that each new variety has some advantage over others, almost inevitably leads to the extermination of the older and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, if we suppose a species to produce two or more varieties, and these in the course of time to produce other varieties, the principle of good being derived from diversification of structure will generally lead to the preservation of the most divergent varieties; thus the lesser differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of varieties come to be augmented into the greater differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of species, and, by the extermination of the older intermediate forms, new species come to be distinctly defined objects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the principles here briefly sketched out, there is no innate or necessary tendency in each being to its own <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment in the scale of organization.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are almost compelled to look at the specialization or differentiation of parts or organs for different functions as the best or even sole standard of <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment; for by such division of labour each function of body and mind is better performed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And, as natural selection acts exclusively through the preservation of profitable modifications of structure, and as the conditions of life in each area generally become more and more complex, from the increasing number of different forms which inhabit it and from most of these forms acquiring a more and more perfect structure, we may confidently believe, that, on the whole, organization <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless a very simple form fitted for very simple conditions of life might remain for indefinite ages unaltered or un<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d; for what would it profit an infusorial animalcule, for instance, or an intestinal worm, to become highly organized? Members of a high group might even become, and this apparently has occurred, fitted for simpler conditions of life; and in this case natural selection would tend to simplify or degrade the organization, for complicated mechanism for simple actions would be useless or even disadvantageous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These difficulties may be classed under the following heads:--the apparent impossibility in some cases of a very simple organ graduating by small steps into a highly perfect organ; the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous facts of Instinct; the whole <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of Hybridity; and, lastly, the absence, at the present time and in our geological formations, of innumerable links connecting all allied species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now this hypothesis may be tested,--and this seems to me the only fair and legitimate manner of considering the whole <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>,--by trying whether it explains several large and independent classes of facts; such as the geological succession of organic beings, their distribution in past and present times, and their mutual affinities and homologies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of these facts which first led me to take up the present subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To exhume with one's own hands the bones of extinct and {11} gigantic quadrupeds brings the whole <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the succession of species vividly before one's mind; and I had found in South America great pieces of tesselated armour exactly like, but on a magnificent scale, that covering the pigmy armadillo; I had found great teeth like those of the living sloth, and bones like those of the cavy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is notorious that the fossil remains of closely consecutive formations are closely allied in structure, and we can at once <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the fact if they are likewise closely allied by descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ancient and extinct forms of life often show combined or intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, like the words of a dead language with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its several offshoots or living tongues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It will be seen in my third work that these complex affinities and the rules for classification receive a rational explanation on the principle of descent, together with modifications acquired through natural selection, entailing divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and the extinction of intermediate forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the same principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, and on the principle of variations not generally supervening at a very early period of embryonic growth (and both these principles can be shown to be probable from direct evidence), that most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact in the whole round of natural history, namely, the similarity of members of the same great class in their embryonic condition,--the embryo, for instance, of a mammal, bird, reptile, and fish being barely distinguishable,--becomes simply intelligible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is the <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> and explanation of such facts as these which has convinced me that the theory of descent with modification by means of natural selection is in the main true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is the facts and views to be hereafter given which have convinced me of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The present action of natural selection may seem more or less probable; but I believe in the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of the theory, {14} because it collects under one point of view, and gives a rational explanation of, many apparently independent classes of facts.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall probably never be able to ascertain their origin with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Palæontology[5] does not throw much light on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, owing, on the one hand, to the close similarity of the skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals, and owing on the other hand to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the several breeds of the domestic dogs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter view is extremely improbable; it allows nothing for variation; it passes over the almost monstrous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of some of the breeds; and it almost necessarily assumes, that a large number of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog; whereas we plainly see that the members of the dog-family are extirpated by human agency with much difficulty; even so recently as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island as Ireland.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Walther has remarked it is impossible to recognise the greater number with any <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, also, a turnspit, with short and crooked legs, closely resembling the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity is so common with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even, according to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to look at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits: Colonel Sykes[9] also has described an Indian Pariah dog as presenting the same monstrous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rütimeyer,[13] that during the Neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size existed, which in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf and jackal, and partook of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of our hounds and setters or spaniels (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by Rütimeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties have descended from an unknown and extinct form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But we should not forget that we know nothing with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the antiquity of man in the warmer parts of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before entering on details, it will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in the belief that several canine species have been domesticated; for there is much difficulty in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> with some other domestic quadrupeds and birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a more important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> that several canine species evince (as will be shown in a future chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to breed under confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is one of the commonest bars to domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, savages set the highest value, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on dogs: even half-tamed animals are highly useful to them: the Indians of North America cross their half-wild dogs with wolves, and thus render them even wilder than before, but bolder: the savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and use the w<strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s of two wild species of _Canis_, as do the savages of Australia those of the wild Dingo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s we see that there is no difficulty in believing that man might have domesticated various canine species in different countries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Kane has often seen in his teams of sledge-dogs the oblique eye (a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> on which some naturalists lay great stress), the drooping tail, and s<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d look of the wolf.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> the Esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves, and, according to Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their affinity is so close with wolves that they frequently cross with them, and the Indians take the w<strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s of wolves "to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breed of their dogs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These facts show that there can be but little, if any, sterility between the Esquimaux dog and the wolf, for otherwise they would not be used to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lord, in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Richardson, after describing the Hare Indian dog, which differs in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s from the Esquimaux dog, says, "It bears the same relation to the prairie wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the great grey wolf.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Schomburgk, who has so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully explored these regions, writes to me, "I have been repeatedly told by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near the coast, that they cross their dogs with a wild species to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the breed, and individual dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, Rengger,[21] gives reasons for believing that a hairless dog was domesticated when America was first visited by Europeans: some of these dogs in Paraguay are still dumb, and Tschudi[22] states that they suffer from cold in the Cordillera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The common wolf of India is also by some <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed as a third species, and here again we find a marked resemblance between the pariah dogs of certain districts of India and the Indian wolf.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[24] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy Saint Hilaire[25] says that not one constant difference can be pointed out between their structure and that of the smaller races of dogs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[26] A number of excellent naturalists, from the time of Güldenstädt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich, and Cretzschmar, have expressed themselves in the strongest terms with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the resemblance of the half-domestic dogs of Asia and Egypt to jackals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hodgson,[32] and became as sensible to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>sses, and manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting dog of the same age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The habit of barking, however, which is almost universal with domesticated {27} dogs, and which does not <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise a single natural species of the family, seems an exception; but this habit is soon lost and soon reacquired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" According to Professor Nillson,[35] a wolf-w<strong style='color: red'>help</strong> reared by a bitch barks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One fact, however, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the colouring of domestic dogs, I at one time hoped might have thrown some light on their origin; and it is worth giving, as showing how colouring follows laws, even in so anciently and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the dog.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fox has given me three <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully recorded cases of retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not counting this day, but counting that of parturition, the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on account of its offensive smell; but savages are not sensitive in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Smith makes a sectional division of the group with one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> dependent on not being offensive.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, dogs--for instance, rough and smooth terriers--differ much in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>; and M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, as Broca has well remarked,[48] the fertility of successive generations of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which is thought indispensable when species are crossed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Pallas assumes[50] that a long course of domestication eliminates that sterility which the parent-species would have exhibited if only lately captured; no distinct facts are recorded in support of this hypothesis; but the evidence seems to me so strong (independently of the evidence derived from other domesticated animals) in favour of our domestic dogs having descended from several wild stocks, that I am led to admit the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this hypothesis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Notwithstanding the difficulties in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to fertility given in the last two paragraphs, when we reflect on the inherent improbability of man having domesticated throughout the world one single species alone of so widely distributed, so easily tamed, and so useful a group as the Canidæ; when we reflect on the extreme antiquity of the different breeds; and especially when we reflect on the close similarity, both in external structure and habits, between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild species still inhabiting these same countries, the balance of evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of our dogs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, unless we believe that forms equally or more strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised in these different <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s once existed in nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The proportions of the different bones; the curvature of the lower jaw, the position of the condyles with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the plane of the teeth (on which F.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The naked, so-called Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely deficient in its {35} teeth,[62]--sometimes having none except one molar on each side; but this, though <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the breed, must be considered as a monstrosity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to minor differences little need be said.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cuvier states that, when a fifth toe is present, a fourth cuneiform bone is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great cuneiform bone is raised, and gives on its inner side a large articular surface to the astragalus; so that even the relative connection of the bones, the most constant of all <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, varies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Closely allied varieties, however, sometimes differ in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>; thus Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of their senses, <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s, and inherited habits is notorious to every one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Seeing in how many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s the races of the dog differ from each other, and remembering Cuvier's admission that their skulls differ more than do those of the species of any natural genus, and bearing in mind how closely the bones of wolves, jackals, foxes, and other Canidæ agree, it is remarkable that we meet with the statement, repeated over and over again, that the races of the dog differ in no important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Some of the differences above enumerated are in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of comparatively little value, for they are not <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of distinct breeds: no one pretends that such is the case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammæ; the additional digit is generally present with mastiffs, and some of the more important differences in the skull and lower jaw are more or less <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of various breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Man {37} <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s for the form and fleetness of his greyhounds, for the size of his mastiffs, for the strength of the jaw in his bulldogs, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>; but he <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s nothing about the number of their molar teeth or mammæ or digits; nor do we know that differences in these organs are correlated with, or owe their development to, differences in other parts of the body about which man does <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the precise causes and steps by which the several races of dogs have come to differ so greatly from each other, we are, as in most other cases, profoundly ignorant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Captain Williamson,[76] who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to this subject, states that "hounds are the most rapid in their decline;" "greyhounds and {38} pointers, also, rapidly decline.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Falconer informs me that bulldogs, which have been known, when first brought into the country, to pin down even an elephant by its trunk, not only fall off after two of three generations in pluck and ferocity, but lose the under-hung <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their lower jaws; their muzzles become finer and their bodies lighter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>English dogs imported into India are so valuable that probably due <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> has been taken to prevent their crossing with native dogs; so that the deterioration cannot be thus accounted for.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of the peculiarities <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the several breeds of the dog have probably arisen suddenly, and, though strictly inherited, may be called monstrosities; for instance, the shape of the legs and body in the turnspit of Europe and India; the shape of the head and the under-hanging jaw in the bull and pug-dog, so alike in this one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> and so unlike in all others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[80] As aquatic animals which belong to quite different orders have webbed feet, there can be no doubt that this structure would be <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to dogs that frequent the water.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As changes in domestic breeds which take place so slowly as not to be noticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in throwing indirect light on the changes effected under nature, I will give in detail such cases as I have been able to collect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this latter dog, Youatt,[83] who is generally cautious in his statements, says that the greyhound within the last fifty years, that is before the commencement of the present century, "assumed a somewhat different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from that which he once possessed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" An able writer[84] believes that our English greyhounds are the descendants, _progressively <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d_, of the large rough greyhounds which existed in Scotland so early as the third century.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The setter, as this author remarks in another place, "is evidently the large spaniel <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d to his present peculiar size and beauty, and taught another way of marking his game.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[87] These several cases of slow and gradual changes in our English dogs possess some interest; for though the changes have generally, but not invariably, been caused by one or two crosses with a distinct breed, yet we may feel sure, from the well-known extreme variability of crossed breeds, that rigorous and long-continued selection must have been practised, in order to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> them in a definite manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as any strain or family became slightly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d or better adapted to altered circumstances, it would tend to supplant the older and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d strains.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For instance, as soon as the old foxhound was <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by a cross with the greyhound, or by simple selection, and assumed its present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>--and the change was probably required by {43} the increased fleetness of our hunters--it rapidly spread throughout the country, and is now everywhere nearly uniform.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the process of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment is still going on, for every one tries to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> his strain by occasionally procuring dogs from the best kennels.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several naturalists, as Pallas, Temminck, Blyth, believe that domestic cats are the descendants of several species {44} commingled: it is certain that cats cross readily with various wild species, and it would appear that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the domestic breeds has, at least in some cases, been thus affected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to one of these species, _F.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Elliot, informs me that he once killed, near Madras, a wild brood, which were evidently hybrids from the domestic cat; these young animals had a thick lynx-like tail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of _F.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several cases we see that in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, the common cat, which lives a freer life than most other domesticated animals, has crossed with various wild species; and that in some instances the crossing has been sufficiently frequent to affect the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>,[95] states that all the cats are covered with short stiff hair instead of fur: he gives a curious account of a cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for some time on board and could be identified with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>; this {47} animal was left for only eight weeks at Mombas, but during that short period it "underwent a complete metamorphosis, having parted with its sandy-coloured fur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The domestic cat has run wild in several countries, and everywhere assumes, as far as can be judged by the short recorded descriptions, a uniform <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Near Maldonado, in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly wild; it was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ises some cats in India.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Compare the race-horse, dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; and see how much greater the difference is than between the six or seven other living species of the genus Equus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{50} Of individual variations not known to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise particular breeds, and not great or injurious enough to be called monstrosities, I have not collected many cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[108] Even in so fleeting a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as colour, Hofacker[109] found that, out of two hundred and sixteen cases in which horses of the same colour were paired, only eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the causes of the modifications which horses have undergone, the conditions of life seem to produce a considerable direct effect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> as far eastward as Japan, the horse reacquires his full size.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is scarcely possible to doubt that the long-continued selection of qualities <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to man has been the chief agent in the formation of the several breeds of the horse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As a writer in India, who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now, "looking at our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that they were the result of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?" The <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment is so marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup "the first descendants of Arabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are allowed a discount of 18 lbs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[124] It is notorious that the Arabs have long been as <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful about the pedigree of their horses as we are, and this implies great and continued <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in breeding.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Seeing what has been done in England by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeding, can we doubt that the Arabs must likewise have produced during the course of centuries a marked effect on the qualities of their horses? But we may go much farther back in time, for in the most ancient known book, the Bible, we hear of studs <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully kept for breeding, {55} and of horses imported at high prices from various countries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By the expression analogous variation (and it is one that I shall often have occasion to use) I mean a variation occurring in a species or variety which resembles a normal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in another and distinct species or variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Analogous variations may arise, as will be explained in a future chapter, {56} from two or more forms with a similar constitution having been exposed to similar conditions,--or from one of two forms having reacquired through reversion a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> inherited by the other form from their common progenitor,--or from both forms having reverted to the same ancestral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] This tendency in the horse to become striped is in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s an interesting feet.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the North-Western parts of India striped horses of more than one breed are apparently commoner than in any other part of the world; and I have received information <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing them from several officers, especially from Colonel Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major Campbell, Brigadier St.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The latter is by far the commonest of all the stripes, as might have been expected, as it <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ises the other seven or eight species of the genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is remarkable that so trifling a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as the shoulder-stripe being double or triple should occur in such different breeds as Welch and Devonshire ponies, the Shan pony, heavy cart-horses, light South American horses, and the lanky Kattywar breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the primitive colour of the horse having been dun, Colonel Hamilton Smith[136] has collected a large body of evidence showing that this tint was common in the East as far back as the time of Alexander, and that the wild horses of Western Asia and Eastern Europe now are, or recently were, of various shades of dun.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the appearance of the stripes on the various breeds of the horse, when of a dun-colour, does not afford nearly such good evidence of their descent from a single primitive stock as in the case of the pigeon; because no certainly wild horse is known as a standard of comparison; because the stripes when they do appear are variable in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; because there is far from sufficient evidence of the appearance of the stripes from the crossing of distinct breeds; and lastly, because all the species of the genus Equus have the spinal stripe, and several have shoulder and leg stripes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[138] The ass is sometimes <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d as an instance of an animal domesticated, as we know by the Old Testament, from an ancient period, which has varied only in a very slight degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This may probably be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by poor persons, who do not rear large numbers, nor <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully match and select the young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For, as we shall see in a future chapter, the ass can with ease be greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d in size and strength by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection, combined no doubt with good food; and we may infer that all its other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s would be equally amenable to selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The small size of the ass in England and Northern Europe is apparently due far more to want of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in breeding than to cold; for in Western India, where the ass is used as a beast of burden by some of the lower castes, it is not much larger than a Newfoundland dog, "being generally not more than from twenty to thirty inches high.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the horse the occasional appearance of leg-stripes was accounted for, through the principle of reversion, by the supposition that the primitive horse was {63} thus striped; with the ass we may confidently <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> this explanation, for the parent-form, the _A.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The shoulder-stripe, which is so eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the species, is nevertheless variable in breadth, length, and manner of termination.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I first noticed the forking and angular bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes {64} in the various equine species to feel convinced that even a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led to attend to the subject.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[144] Nathusius has shown that all the known breeds may be divided in two great groups: one resembling in all important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s and no doubt descended from the common wild boar; so that this may be called the _Sus scrofa_ group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The other group differs in several important and constant osteological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; its wild parent-form is unknown; the name given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of priority, is _Sus Indica_ of Pallas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>75), in various parts of central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom,[145] and almost every province in Britain, possessed its own native breed; but these are now everywhere rapidly disappearing, being replaced by <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds crossed with the _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>scrofa_ type resembles, in all important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, that of the European wild boar; but it has become (Schweineschädel, s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>scrofa_ in their essential skull-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s differ conspicuously from each other in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, as in the length of the ears and legs, curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and proportions of the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The wild _Sus scrofa_ has a wide range, namely, Europe, North Africa, as identified by osteological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by Rütimeyer, and Hindostan, as similarly identified by Nathusius.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the wild boars inhabiting these several countries differ so much from each other in external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, that they have been ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>scrofa_ in several minor <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, as in its greater breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the shortness of the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore part of the palate-bones, and in the divergence of the premolar teeth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It deserves especial notice that these latter <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are not gained, even in the least degree, by the domesticated forms of _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Roman or Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian, the Hungarian, and the "Krause" swine of Nathusius, inhabiting south-eastern Europe and Turkey, and having fine curly hair, and the small Swiss "Bündtnerschwein" of Rütimeyer, all agree in their more important skull <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s with _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indica_ group; but Rütimeyer has subsequently shown that it differs in some well-marked <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>147), is not convinced of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this conclusion; and Rütimeyer himself seems now to feel some doubt.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[151] Hence the Chinese breed, as Nathusius has remarked,[152] displays in an eminent degree the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of a highly-cultivated race, and hence, no doubt, its {69} high value in the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of our European breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the chief distinctive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, being common to several of the species of the genus; for in crosses the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those appertaining to only a few species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt; and this might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not longitudinally striped; for this is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> common to all the species included within the genus _Sus_ and the allied genera whilst in their natural state.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nathusius, however, after his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful study of the whole group, states positively (Schweineschädel, s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>153-158) that the skull in all essential <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s closely resembles that of the short-eared Chinese breed of the _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indica_: if this really be the case, it is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instance of the amount of modification which can be effected under domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[157] Seeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the _Sus Indica_ type, are in their osteological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s and in external {71} appearance from the pigs of the _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The modifications of the skull in the most highly cultivated races are <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Indica_ type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in the slightly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds of the _S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one, that the peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is not <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of any one race, but is common to all when <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d up to the same standard.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With most domestic animals the result of selection has been divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, here it has been convergence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fox has given me ten <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied from 101 to 116 days.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>S<strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>ers has lately described and figured[167] the structure of the feet; in both front and hind feet the distal phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a single, great, hoof-bearing phalanx; and in the front feet, the middle phalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards the lower end, but bears two separate articulations towards the upper end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Eudes-Deslongchamps as often <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izing the Normandy pigs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not surprising that the tusks should be more affected than the other teeth; as parts developed to serve as secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are always liable to much variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> generally disappears under domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of New Granada, both those which are black and those which are black with a white band across the stomach, often extending over the back, have resumed this aboriginal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and produce longitudinally-striped young.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[171] The common belief that all domesticated animals, when they run wild, revert completely to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their parent-stock, is chiefly founded, as far as I can discover, on feral pigs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[172] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to colour, feral pigs generally revert to that of the wild boar; but in certain parts of S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Improved Essex pigs, for instance, breed very true; but there is no doubt that they largely owe their present excellent qualities to crosses originally made by Lord Western with the Neapolitan race, and to subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed (this also having been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by Neapolitan crosses), and likewise, probably, with the Sussex breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[173] In breeds thus formed by complex crosses, the most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and unremitting selection during many generations has been found to be indispensable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They differ from common cattle in various osteological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, even in a greater degree, according to Rütimeyer,[175] than do the fossil species of Europe, namely _Bos primigenius, longifrons_, and _frontosus_, from each other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They have given rise to many races differing greatly in size, in the presence {80} of one or two humps, in length of horns, and other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the parentage of the several European breeds, we already know much from Nilsson's Memoir,[180] and more especially from Rütimeyer's 'Pfahlbauten' and succeeding works.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As zebus inhabit a distant and much hotter region, and as they differ in so many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from our European cattle, I have taken pains to ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when crossed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the preservation of a uniform <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, even within the same park, a certain degree of selection--that is, the destruction of the dark-coloured calves--is apparently necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Within recent times most of the breeds have been modified by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and methodical selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How strongly the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus acquired are inherited, may be inferred from the prices realised by the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds; even at the first sale of Colling's Short-horns, eleven bulls reached an average of 214l.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[201] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the period of conception, it seems certain that Alderney and Zetland cows often become pregnant earlier than other breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[202] Lastly, as four fully-developed mammæ is a generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the genus Bos,[203] it is worth notice that with our domestic cows the two rudimentary mammæ often become fairly well developed and yield milk.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Andersson in his letter to me says that, though he will not venture to describe the differences between the breeds belonging to the many different sub-tribes, yet such certainly exist, as shown by the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful facility with which the natives discriminate them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This breed bears the same relation to other breeds, as bull or pug dogs do to other dogs, or as <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d pigs, according to H.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is an interesting fact that an almost similar conformation <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izes, as I have been informed by Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact, on comparison with the skull of a common ox, scarcely a single bone presents the same exact shape, and the whole skull has a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully different appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A niata bull crossed with a common cow, and the reverse cross, yield offspring having an intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but with the niata <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> strongly displayed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The eye was very peculiar, being remarkably prominent, and "resembled a cup and ball, thus enabling the animal to see on all sides with equal ease; the pupil was small and oval, or rather a parallelogram with the ends cut off, and lying transversely across the ball," A new and strange breed might probably have been formed by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeding and selection from this animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have often speculated on the probable causes through which each separate district in Great Britain came to possess in former times its own peculiar breed of cattle; and the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, perhaps, even more perplexing in the case of Southern Africa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we compare highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d stall-fed cattle with the wilder breeds, or compare mountain and lowland breeds, we cannot doubt that an active life, leading to the free use of the limbs and lungs, affects the shape and proportions of the whole body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, have appeared suddenly from what we may call a spontaneous variation; but even in this case a rude kind of selection is necessary, and the animals thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized must be at least partially separated from others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This degree of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, however, has sometimes been taken even in little-civilized districts, where we should least have expected it, as in the case of the niata, chivo, and hornless cattle in S.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That methodical selection has done <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s within a recent period in modifying our cattle, no one doubts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fowler, {93} this bull greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d his race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have also reason to believe that selection, carried on so far unconsciously that there was at no one time any distinct intention to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> or change the breed, has in the course of time modified most of our cattle; for by this process, aided by more abundant food, all the lowland British breeds have increased greatly in size and in early maturity since the reign of Henry VII.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In every district, as Youatt has remarked, there is a prejudice in favour of the native breed; so that animals possessing qualities, whatever they may be, which are most valued in each district, will be oftenest preserved; and this unmethodical selection assuredly will in the long run affect the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the whole breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as two or more breeds had once been formed in any district, or when new breeds descended from distinct species were introduced, their crossing, especially if aided by some selection, will have multiplied the number and modified the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the older breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of the most strongly marked races is an Eastern one with a long tail, including, according to Pallas, twenty vertebræ, and so loaded with fat, that, from being <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a delicacy, it is sometimes placed on a truck which is dragged about by the living animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The horns present an endless diversity in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; being, especially in the female sex, not rarely absent, or, on the other hand, amounting to four or even eight in number.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Forbes, that the Spanish sheep in Chile resemble, in fleece and in all other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, their parent merino-race, except that instead of a pair they generally bear four horns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The existence of a pair of mammæ is a generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the genus Ovis as well as in several allied forms; nevertheless, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hodgson has remarked, "this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is not absolutely constant even among the true and proper sheep: for I have more than once met with Cágias (a sub-Himalayan domestic race) possessed of four teats.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In sheep there is a strong tendency for <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, which have apparently been acquired under domestication, to become attached either exclusively to the male sex, or to be more highly developed in this than in the other sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hodgson states that the extraordinarily arched nose or chaffron, which is so highly developed in several foreign breeds, is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the ram alone, and apparently is the result of domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds arrive at maturity at an early age, as has been well shown by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The period of gestation was formerly thought to be so unalterable a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, that a supposed difference between the wolf and the dog in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> was <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a sure sign of specific distinction; but we have seen that the period is shorter in the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds of the pig, and in the larger breeds of the ox, than in other breeds of these two animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is of course possible that the difference in these two breeds may be due to their descent from distinct parent-species; but as the early maturity of the Southdowns has long been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to by breeders, the difference is more probably the result of such attention.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Pallas makes an analogous statement with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to one of the Crimean breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[233] In all such cases, however, it may be that a change of any kind in the conditions of life causes variability and consequent loss of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and not that certain conditions are necessary for the development of certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This curious result seems merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the Merino breed, for as a great authority, namely, Lord Somerville, remarks, "the wool of our Merino sheep after shear-time is hard and coarse to such a degree as to render it almost impossible to suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in quality, compared to that which has been clipped from it: as the cold weather <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s, the fleeces recover their soft quality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[235] In the wild mountain-sheep (_Ovis montana_) of North America there is an annual analogous change of coat; "the wool begins to drop out in early spring, leaving in its place a coat of hair resembling that of the elk, a change of pelage quite different in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the ordinary thickening of the coat or hair, common to all furred animals in winter,--for instance, in the horse, the cow, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it should be observed, as Youatt repeatedly insists, that the tendency to change may generally be counteracted by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The case of the Southdowns, as <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by Ellman, offers perhaps the most striking instance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Spooner's paper--will dispute; but to produce uniformity, in a crossed breed, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection and "rigorous weeding," as this author expresses it, are indispensable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These sheep are remarkable from transmitting their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> so truly that Colonel Humphreys[238] never heard of "but one <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>able case" of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When they are crossed with other breeds the offspring, with rare exceptions, instead of being intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, perfectly resemble either parent; and this has occurred even in the case of twins.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The long smooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns; and as horns and hair are homologous structures, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the meaning of this correlation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[239] In Switzerland, during the early Stone period, the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep; and this very ancient race differed in no <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> from that now common in Switzerland.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[245] The presence of interdigital pits or glands on all four feet has been thought to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise the genus Ovis, and their absence to be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the genus Capra; but Mr.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Professor Gervais[247] states "that the true wild rabbit is smaller than the domestic; its proportions are not absolutely the same; its tail is smaller; its ears are shorter and more thickly clothed with hair; and these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, without speaking of colour, are so many indications opposed to the opinion which unites these animals under the same specific denomination.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How extraordinary it would be, if close confinement, perfect tameness, unnatural food, and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeding, all prolonged during many generations, had not produced at least some effect! The tame rabbit has been domesticated from an ancient period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" From this full description we see that silver-grey rabbits existed in England at this period; and, what is far more important, we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was then <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Only one wild species is known with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> to exist in Europe; but the rabbit (if it be a true rabbit) from Mount Sinai, and likewise that from Algeria, present slight differences; and these forms have been considered by some authors as specifically distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[252] But such slight differences would aid us little in explaining the more considerable differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the several domestic races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But from what we hear of the late <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous success in rearing hybrids between the hare and rabbit,[253] it is possible, though not probable, from the great difficulty in making the first cross, that some of the larger races, which are coloured like the hare, may have been modified by crosses with this animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are many breeds which transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s more or less truly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The great weight of the body in the larger rabbits, and the immense development of their ears, are the qualities which win prizes, and have been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully selected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In short, they were {107} coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently to be described, and differed from them only in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their fur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are two other breeds which come true to colour, but differ in no other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, namely silver-greys and chinchillas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[256] Certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are remarkably fluctuating, or are very feebly transmitted by domestic rabbits: thus, one breeder tells me that with the smaller kinds he has hardly ever raised a whole litter of the same colour: with the large lop-eared breeds "it is impossible," says a great judge,[257] "to breed true to colour, but by judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lop-eared rabbits, with their ears hanging flat down on each side of the face, do not transmit this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> at all truly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When one parent, or even both, are oar-laps, that is, have their ears sticking out at right angles, or when one parent or both are half-lops, that is, have only one ear dependent, there is nearly as good a chance of the progeny having both ears full-lop, as if both parents had been thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bartlett[263] was led to make a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful trial in the Zoological Gardens, and he found that by simply crossing silver-greys with chinchillas he could always produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding their sudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Silver-greys and chinchillas, on the other hand, present a remarkable contrast in their colour whilst quite young, for they are born perfectly black, but soon assume their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic grey or silver tints.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When they are crossed with common rabbits, the offspring are said not to have blended colours, but to take after either parent; and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they resemble black and albino varieties of most quadrupeds, which often transmit their colours in this same manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a future chapter I shall <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> a large body of facts showing that, when two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour from their parent-stock, there is a strong tendency in the young to revert to the aboriginal colour; and what is very remarkable, this reversion occasionally supervenes, not before birth, but during the growth of the animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But why, it may be asked, do the ears, tail, nose, and feet, and no other part of the body, revert to a black colour? This apparently depends on a law, which generally holds good, namely, that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s common to many species of a genus--and this, in fact, implies long inheritance in common from the ancient progenitor of the genus--are found to resist variation, or to reappear if lost, more persistently than the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are confined to the separate species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We do not know the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the mother-rabbit; but we have every reason to believe that it was the common domesticated kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the most remarkable difference is in the ears and tail; I have examined many fresh English rabbits, and the large collection of skins in the British Museum from various countries, and all have the upper surface of the tail and the tips of the ears clothed with blackish-grey fur; and this is given in most works as one of the specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the rabbit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, from the three cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do not, under new conditions of life, revert to or retain their aboriginal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, as is so generally asserted to be the case by most authors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Osteological Characters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It must not be supposed that the more important differences immediately to be described strictly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise any one breed; all that can be said is, that they are generally present in certain breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We should bear in mind that selection has not been applied to fix any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the skeleton, and that the animals have not had to support themselves under {116} uniform habits of life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We cannot account for most of the differences in the skeleton; but we shall see that the increased size of the body, due to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful nurture and continued selection, has affected the head in a particular manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As all the bones in these four specimens from such distant localities closely resembled each other, presenting scarcely any appreciable difference, it may be concluded that the bones of the wild rabbit are generally uniform in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--I have <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined skulls of ten large lop-eared fancy rabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter differ from the lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both larger than in the wild rabbit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] This elongation of the skull relatively to its breadth, I find a universal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, not only with the large lop-eared rabbits, but in all the artificial breeds; as is well seen in the skull of the Angora.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I here give a drawing of the skull of a half-lop; and it may be observed that the suture between the parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the skull; the left frontal bone projects beyond the right one; both the posterior and anterior margins of the left zygomatic arch on the side of the lopping ear stand a little in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of the corresponding bones on the opposite side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even the lower jaw is affected, and the condyles are not quite symmetrical, that on the left standing a little in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of that on the right.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The skull of the _Angora_ rabbit, like the latter five skulls, is intermediate in general proportions, and in most other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, between those of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It presents only one singular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: though considerably longer than the skull of the wild, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The skulls of the _silver-grey_, and _chinchilla_ and _Himalayan_ rabbits are more elongated than in the wild, with broader supra-orbital plates, but differ little in any other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, excepting that the upper and lower notches of the occipital foramen are not so deep or so well developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The skull of the _Moscow_ rabbit scarcely differs in any <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> from that of the wild rabbit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As some of the largest lop-eared rabbits of which I prepared skeletons were coloured almost like hares, and as these latter animals and rabbits have, as it is affirmed, been recently crossed in France, it might be thought that some of the above-described <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s had been derived from a cross at a remote period with the hare.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, an interesting fact, as illustrating the law that varieties of one species often assume the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of other species of the same genus, that I found, on comparing the skulls of ten species of hares in the British Museum, that they differed from each other chiefly in the very same points in which domestic rabbits vary,--namely, in general proportions, in the form and size of the supra-orbital plates, in the form of the free end of the malar bone, and in the line of suture separating the occipital and frontal bones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover two eminently variable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in the domestic rabbit, namely, the outline of the occipital foramen and the shape of the "raised platform" of the occiput, were likewise variable in two instances in the same species of hare.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The caudal vertebræ apparently differ by two or three, but I did not attend to them, and they are difficult to count with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the large lop-<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d rabbits the neural spines of the tenth, ninth, eighth, and even in a slight degree that of the seventh vertebra, are very much thicker, and of somewhat different shape, in comparison with those of the wild rabbit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, in one of the feral Porto Santo rabbits, which in most of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s deviates in an exactly opposite manner to what the large lop-<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d rabbits do from the common wild rabbit, the neural spines of the ninth and tenth vertebræ were not at all larger than those of the several anterior vertebræ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the variations in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s in the wild rabbit are very slight; whilst in the large lop-eared rabbits they are considerable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--In these I could detect no variation; but the bones of the feet were too troublesome to compare with much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> arises, has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from their greatly increased size of body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may endeavour to answer this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> in two ways: in the upper half of the Table we have measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits (Nos.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The seven large lop-<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d rabbits, on an average, have skulls 4.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>23, 24) is so much larger than the average capacity of the seven lop-<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d skulls, that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With the increased size of the body the third cervical vertebra has assumed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the fourth cervical; and the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebræ have similarly assumed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to the tenth and posterior vertebræ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The skull has thus acquired its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic narrowness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>ENUMERATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL BREEDS--INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY--VARIATIONS OF A REMARKABLE NATURE--OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS: SKULL, LOWER JAW, NUMBER OF VERTEBRÆ--CORRELATION OF GROWTH: TONGUE WITH BEAK; EYELIDS AND NOSTRILS WITH WATTLED SKIN--NUMBER OF WING-FEATHERS, AND LENGTH OF WING--COLOUR AND DOWN--WEBBED AND FEATHERED FEET--ON THE EFFECTS OF DISUSE--LENGTH OF FEET IN CORRELATION WITH LENGTH OF BEAK--LENGTH OP STERNUM, SCAPULA, AND FURCULA--LENGTH OF WINGS--SUMMARY ON THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE IN THE SEVERAL BREEDS I have been led to study domestic pigeons with particular <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, because the evidence that all the domestic races have descended from one known source is far clearer than with any other anciently domesticated animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And lastly, because, from causes which we can partly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, the amount of variation has been extraordinarily great.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The details will often be tediously minute; but no one who really wants to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the progress of change in domestic animals will regret this; and no one who has kept pigeons and has marked the great difference between the breeds and the trueness with which most of them propagate their kind, will think this <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> superfluous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[275] Since my admission into two of the London pigeon-clubs, I have received the kindest <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance from many of the most eminent amateurs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But of these the far greater number differ from each other only in unimportant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have looked through the magnificent collection of the Columbidæ in the British Museum, and, with the exception of a few forms (such as the Didunculus, Calænas, Goura, &c), I do not hesitate to {133} affirm that some domestic races of the rock-pigeon differ fully as much from each other in external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as do the most distinct natural genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I refer only to external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, on which, however, it must be confessed that most genera of birds have been founded.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When, in a future chapter, we discuss the principle of selection as followed by man, we shall clearly see why the differences between the domestic races are almost always confined to external, or at least to externally visible, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Owing to the amount and gradations of difference between the several breeds, I have found it indispensable in the following classification to rank them under Groups, Races, and Sub-races; to which varieties and sub-varieties, all strictly inheriting their proper <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, must often be added.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can be no doubt that, if well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized forms of the several Races had been found wild, all would have been ranked as distinct species, and several of them would certainly have been placed by ornithologists in distinct genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Characters of all kinds must be used; but as with birds in a state of nature, those afforded by the beak are the best and most readily appreciated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not possible to weigh the importance of all the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which have to be used so as to make the groups and sub-groups of equal value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, a group may contain only one race, and another and less distinctly defined group may contain several races and sub-races, and in this case it is difficult, as in the classification of natural species, to avoid placing too high a value on <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are common to a large number of forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the most strongly marked sub-race be taken, namely, the Improved English Pouter, this is perhaps the most distinct of all domesticated pigeons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--The <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Pouter, when its crop is fully inflated, presents a truly astonishing appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--This seems to be the parent-form of our <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Pouters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are smaller than English pouters, and less well developed in all their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Boitard and Corbié; it pouts but little, and is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised {139} by the habit of violently hitting its wings together over its back,--a habit which the English Pouter has in a slight degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s there is an approach in form to the common rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet, if well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised Carriers and Barbs (see figs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The beak is attenuated and of <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful length: in one specimen it was 1.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--The English Dragon differs from the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Carrier in being smaller in all its dimensions, and in having less wattle round the eyes and over the nostrils, and none on the lower mandible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Murray, also, sent me two Carriers direct from Persia; these had nearly the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as the Madras bird, being about as large as the rock-pigeon, but the beak in one specimen was as much as 1.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And it deserves especial notice that, even if we neglect the Kala Par as of doubtful origin, we get a series broken by very small steps, from the rock-pigeon, through the Bussorah, which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the rock-pigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated, through the Bagdad sub-race and Dragons, to our <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Carriers, which present so <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous a difference from the rock-pigeon or _Columba livia_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are generally pretty constant in other pigeons, such as the length of the wings, tail, legs, and neck, and the amount of naked skin round the eyes, are excessively variable in Runts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>1) agrees with the above description in all the specified <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (for the beak is not mentioned), except that Neumeister expressly says that the neck is short, whereas in my Scanderoon it was remarkably long and bowed; so that the Hinkel forms a well-marked variety.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--I am not sure that I am right in placing these Runts in a distinct sub-race; yet, if we take well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized birds, there can be no doubt of the propriety of the separation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had imagined that this latter <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, so abnormal in the group, was merely a false representation from bad drawing; but Moore, in his work published in 1735, says that he possessed a Leghorn Runt of which "the beak was very short for so large a bird.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s Moore's bird resembled the first sub-race or Scanderoon, for it had a long bowed neck, long legs, short beak, and elevated tail, and not much wattle about the head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fanciers, with some <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, compare the head and beak of the Barb to that of a bullfinch.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may be defined by the beak, in well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised specimens of the several races, being shorter than in the rock-pigeon, and by the skin round the eyes not being much developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The feathers are arranged in an irregular double row; their permanent expansion, like a fan, and their upward direction, are more remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s than their increased number.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fantails were known in India, as we shall hereafter see, before the year 1600; and we may suspect that in the Java Fantail we see the breed in its earlier and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of them occasionally appear to become giddy and tumble to the ground, in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they resemble some of our Tumblers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is abundant evidence with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to these remarkable peculiarities; but what makes the case the more worthy of attention is, that the habit has been strictly inherited since before the year 1600, for the breed is distinctly described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--These are <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous birds, and are the glory and pride of many fanciers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d short-faced Tumblers have almost lost the power of tumbling; but there are several authentic accounts of their occasionally tumbling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[293] Finally, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the whole group of Tumblers, it is impossible to conceive a more perfect gradation than I have now lying before me, from the rock-pigeon, through Persian, Lotan, and Common Tumblers, up to the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous short-faced birds; which latter, no ornithologist, judging from mere external structure, would place in the same genus with the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Had this bird occurred in Europe, I should have thought it only a monstrous variety of our <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d Tumbler; but as short-faced Tumblers are not known in India, I think it must rank as a distinct breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> this bird is singularly quiet, seldom flying or moving about, as Bechstein and Riedel have likewise remarked in Germany.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The birds of this group may be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by their resemblance in all important points of structure, especially in the beak, to the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are also <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by a tuft of elongated feathers, which curls forward over the base of the beak, and which is possessed by no other breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This breed was perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised in Moore's time, in 1735.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--As this bird agrees in nearly all its proportions with the rock-pigeon, though of smaller size, I should not have thought it worthy of mention, had it not been for its peculiar voice--a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> supposed seldom to vary with birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In young birds the scutellæ on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black colour; and this is a remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> (though observed in a lesser degree in some other breeds), as the colour of the legs in the adult state is subject to very little variation in any breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This breed has retained the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> since Aldrovandi wrote in 1600.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Whether these extraordinary statements may be trusted I know not; but the inheritance of any habit may be believed, after what we have seen with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Ground-tumbler of India.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An old stuffed specimen of a Finnikin in the British Museum presents no well-marked <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sub-races likewise include many strictly inherited varieties; so that altogether there must exist, as previously stated, above 150 kinds which can be distinguished, though generally by <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of extremely slight importance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many of the genera of the Columbidæ, which are admitted by ornithologists, do not differ in any great degree from each other; taking this into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, there can be no doubt that several of the most strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised domestic forms, if found wild, would have been placed in at least five new genera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, a new genus would have been formed for the reception of the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Pouter: a second genus for Carriers and Runts; and this would have been a wide or comprehensive genus, for it would have admitted common Spanish Runts without any wattle, short-beaked Runts like the Tronfo, and the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English Carrier: a third genus would have been termed for the Barb: a fourth for the Fantail: and lastly, a fifth for the short-beaked, not-wattled pigeons, such as Turbits {158} and short-faced Tumblers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ The differences which we have as yet considered are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of distinct breeds; but there are other differences, either confined to individual birds, or often observed in certain breeds but not <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the present day any visible deviation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in a well-established breed is rejected as a blemish; but it by no means follows that at an early period, before well-marked breeds had been formed, such deviations would have been rejected; on the contrary, they would have been eagerly preserved as presenting a novelty, and would then have been slowly augmented, as we shall hereafter more clearly see, by the process of unconscious selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To begin with the primary feathers of the wing and tail; but I may first mention, as some readers may not be aware of the fact, that the number of the primary wing and tail feathers in wild birds is generally constant, and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ises, not only whole genera, but even whole families.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the tail-feathers are unusually numerous, as for instance in the swan, they are apt to be variable in number; but this does not apply to the several species and genera of the Columbidæ, which never (as far as I can hear) have less than twelve or more than sixteen tail-feathers; and these numbers <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise, with rare exception, whole sub-families.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And this shows us how a swallow-tailed breed, like that described by Bechstein, might have been formed by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the primary wing-feathers, the number in the Columbidæ, as far as I can find out, is always nine or ten.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the beak I have observed very considerable differences in birds of the {160} same breed, as in <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully bred Jacobins and Trumpeters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bult reared by accident a hen Jacobin with the feathers on the thigh so long as to reach the ground, and a cock having, but in a lesser degree, the same peculiarity: from these two birds he bred others similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, which were exhibited at the Philoperisteron Club.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[304] It is an important fact, and I believe there is hardly an exception to the rule, that the especial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s for which each breed is valued are eminently variable: thus, in the Fantail, the number and direction of the tail-feathers, the carriage of the body, and the degree of trembling are all highly variable points; in Pouters, the degree to which they pout, and the shape of their inflated crops; in the Carrier, the length, narrowness, and curvature of the beak, and the amount of wattle; in Short-faced Tumblers, the shortness of the beak, the prominence of the forehead, and general carriage,[305] and in the Almond Tumbler the colour of the plumage; in common Tumblers, the manner of tumbling; in the Barb, the breadth and shortness of the beak and the amount of eye-wattle; in Runts, the size of body; in Turbits, the frill; and lastly in Trumpeters, the cooing, as well as the size of the tuft of feathers over the nostrils.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These, which are the distinctive and selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the several breeds, are all eminently variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is another interesting fact with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the different breeds, namely, that they are often most strongly displayed in the male bird.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This augmentation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> with advancing age, and more especially the difference between the males and females in the above-mentioned several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, are highly remarkable facts, for there is no sensible difference at any age between the two sexes in the aboriginal rock-pigeon; and rarely any such difference throughout the whole family of the Columbidæ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] _Osteological Characters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ In the skeletons of the various breeds there is much variability; and though certain differences occur frequently, and others rarely, in certain breeds, yet none can be said to be absolutely <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of any breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering that strongly-marked domestic races have been formed chiefly by man's power {163} of selection, we ought not to expect to find great and constant differences in the skeleton; for fanciers can neither see, nor do they <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for, modifications of structure in the internal framework.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>May not this be accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws, owing to nutritious food having been given during a long period to all highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d pigeons? In runts, carriers, and barbs (and in a lesser degree in several breeds), the whole side of the jaw near the articular end is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner; and the superior margin of the ramus, beyond the middle, is reflexed in an equally remarkable manner, as may be seen in the accompanying figures, in comparison with the jaw of the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all these breeds the seventh pair was very small, and was destitute of processes, in which <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> it differed from the same rib in the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This greatly increased length of the orifice of the nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with the enlargement of the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over the nostrils; and this is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is selected by fanciers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again, the broad, naked, and wattled skin round the eyes of carriers and barbs is a selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and in obvious correlation with this, the eyelids, measured longitudinally, are proportionally more than double the length of those of the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In pouters, the elongation of the body is a selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and the ribs, as we have seen, have generally become very broad, with the seventh pair furnished with processes; the sacral and caudal vertebræ have been augmented in number; the sternum has likewise increased in length (but not in the depth of the crest) by .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With jacobins, the remarkable length of the tail and {170} wing-feathers is not a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which is intentionally selected by fanciers; but fanciers have been trying for centuries, at least since the year 1600, to increase the length of the reversed feathers on the neck, so that the hood may more completely enclose the head; and it may be suspected that the increased length of the wing and tail-feathers stands in correlation with the increased length of the neck-feathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Short-faced tumblers have short wings in nearly due proportion with the reduced size of their bodies; but it is remarkable, seeing that the number of the primary wing-feathers is a constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in most birds, that these tumblers generally have only nine instead of ten primaries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With birds in a state of nature the number of the scutellæ on the feet is usually a constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the sternum, I have <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully measured its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The period at which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic plumage of some breeds is acquired, and at which certain changes of colour supervene, differs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> the several races differ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although many different races have kept true in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during several centuries, as we shall hereafter more fully see, yet there is far more individual variability in the truest breeds than in birds in a state of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is hardly any exception to the rule that those <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s vary most which are now most valued and attended to by fanciers, and which consequently are now being <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by continued selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is indirectly admitted by fanciers when they complain that it is much more difficult to breed high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of excellence than the so-called toy pigeons, which differ from {179} each other merely in colour; for particular colours when once acquired are not liable to continued <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment or augmentation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s become attached, from quite unknown causes, more strongly to the male than to the female sex; so that we have, in certain races, a tendency towards the appearance of secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s,[315] of which the aboriginal rock-pigeon displays not a trace.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of their origin is therefore of fundamental importance, and must be discussed at considerable length.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have therefore good reason to believe that all the domestic races of the pigeon are descended either from some one or from several species which both roosted and built their nests on rocks, and were social in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thirdly, the _Columba littoralis_ builds and roosts, according to Temminck, on rocks in the Malayan archipelago; it is white, excepting parts of the wing and the tip of the tail, which are black; its legs are livid-coloured, and this is a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> not observed in any adult domestic pigeon; but I need not have mentioned this species or the closely-allied _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Guinea_ is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by the feathers of the neck having peculiar notched tips,--a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> not observed in any domestic race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fifthly, the _Columba oenas_ of Europe, which roosts on trees, and builds its nest in holes, either in trees or the ground; this species, as far as external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s go, might be the parent of several domestic races; but, though it crosses readily with the true rock-pigeon, the offspring, as we shall presently see, are sterile hybrids, and of such sterility there is not a trace when the domestic races are intercrossed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This bird agrees in every essential <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> with the breeds which have been only slightly modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_ in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the most trifling value.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover we shall immediately have proof that the blue and white croup is a highly variable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and Bechstein[329] asserts that with dovecot-pigeons in Germany this is the most variable of all the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the plumage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Dovecot-pigeons are those which are kept in dovecots in a semi-domesticated state; for no special <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is taken of them, and they procure their own food, except during the severest weather.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Swinhoe from Foochow, in China, was likewise rather small, but differed in no other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the variation of _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet these pigeons all breed true, and many of them present sub-varieties which likewise truly transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They differ from each other in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s more than do dovecot-pigeons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_, including under this name the above-enumerated wild geographical races; yet the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> becomes far more difficult when we consider the eleven principal races, most of which have been so profoundly modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_, which agrees with them so closely in habits and in most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, which varies in a state of nature, and which has certainly {188} undergone a considerable amount of variation, as in the toy-pigeons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We shall moreover presently see how eminently favourable circumstances have been for a great amount of modification in the more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully tended breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How could crossing produce, for instance, a pouter or a fantail, unless the two supposed aboriginal parents possessed the remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of these breeds? I am aware that some naturalists, following Pallas, believe that crossing gives a strong tendency to variation, independently of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s inherited from either parent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They believe that it would be easier to raise a pouter or fantail pigeon from crossing two distinct species, neither of which possessed the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of these races, than from any single species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which concerns us is, whether or not many new and important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s have arisen since man first domesticated the pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the ordinary view, variability is due to changed conditions of life; on the Pallasian doctrine, variability, or the appearance of new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, is due to some mysterious effect from the crossing of two species, neither of which possess the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering how <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully wild pigeons have been collected throughout the world, and what conspicuous birds they are, especially when frequenting rocks, it is extremely improbable that eight or nine species, which were long ago domesticated and therefore must have inhabited some anciently known country, should still exist in the wild state and be unknown to ornithologists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the view that all the races are the product of variation, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why they have not become feral, for the great amount of modification which they have undergone shows how long and how thoroughly they have been domesticated; and this would unfit them for a wild life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--If it be assumed that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences between the various domestic races are due to descent from several aboriginal species, we must conclude that man chose for domestication in ancient times, either intentionally or by chance, a most abnormal set of pigeons; for that species resembling such birds as pouters, fantails, carriers, barbs, short-faced tumblers, turbits, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, as will hereafter be more fully explained, how any slight deviation in structure which first appeared would continually be augmented by the preservation of the most strongly marked individuals; and as the power of selection would be applied according to man's fancy, and not for the bird's own good, the accumulated amount of deviation would certainly be of an abnormal nature in comparison with the structure of pigeons living in a state of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have already alluded to the remarkable fact, that the {192} <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences between the chief domestic races are eminently variable: we see this plainly in the great difference in the number of the tail-feathers in the fantail, in the development of the crop in pouters, in the length of the beak in tumblers, in the state of the wattle in carriers, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are the result of successive variations added together by selection, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why they should be so variable: for these are the very parts which have varied since the domestication of the pigeon, and therefore would be likely still to vary; these variations moreover have been recently, and are still being accumulated by man's selection; therefore they have not as yet become firmly fixed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--Excluding certain important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences, the chief races agree most closely both with each other and with _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_ in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As previously observed, all are eminently sociable; all dislike to perch or roost, and refuse to build in trees; all lay two eggs, and this is not a universal rule with the Columbidæ; all, as far as I can hear, require the same time for hatching their eggs; all can endure the same great range of climate; all prefer the same food, and are passionately fond of salt; all exhibit (with the asserted exception of the finnikin and turner, which do not differ much in any other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>) the same peculiar gestures when courting the females; and all (with the exception of trumpeters and laughers, which likewise do not differ much in any other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>) coo in the same peculiar manner, unlike the voice of any other wild pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic tints on the breast, a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> far from general with pigeons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All have the proportional length of their toes, and of their primary wing-feathers, nearly the same,--<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which are apt to differ in the several members of the Columbidæ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now every naturalist will admit that it would be scarcely possible to pick out a dozen natural species in any Family, which should agree closely in habits and in general structure, and yet should differ greatly in a few {195} <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact is explicable through the doctrine of natural selection; for each successive modification of structure in each natural species is preserved, solely because it is of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; and such modifications when largely accumulated imply a great change in the habits of life, and this will almost certainly lead to other changes of structure throughout the whole organisation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, if the several races of the pigeon have been produced by man through selection and variation, we can readily <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that they should still all resemble each other in habits and in those many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which man has not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d to modify, whilst they differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which have struck his eye or pleased his fancy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These combined <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are not found in any wild pigeon besides _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have looked <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully through the great collection of pigeons in the British Museum, and I find that a dark bar at the end of the tail is common; that the white edging to the outer tail-feathers is not rare; but that the white croup is extremely rare, and the two black bars on the wings occur in no other pigeon, excepting the alpine _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have myself seen, or acquired trustworthy evidence, as given below,[339] of blue birds with black bars on the wing, with the croup either white or very pale or dark blue, with the tail having a terminal black bar, and with the outer feathers externally edged with white or very pale coloured, in the following races, which, as I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed in each case, appeared to be perfectly pure: namely, in Pouters, Fantails, Tumblers, Jacobins, Turbits, Barbs, Carriers, Runts of three distinct varieties, Trumpeters, Swallows, and in many other toy-pigeons, which, as being closely allied to _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus we see that, in purely-bred races of every kind known in Europe, blue birds occasionally appear having all the marks which <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth, also, has made the same observation with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the various domestic races known in India.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>* * * * * The facts hitherto given refer to the occasional appearance in pure races of blue birds with black wing-bars, and likewise of blue and chequered birds; but it will now be seen that when two birds belonging to distinct races are crossed, neither of which have, nor probably have had during many generations, a trace of blue in their plumage, or a trace of wing-bars and the other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks, they very frequently produce mongrel offspring of a blue colour, sometimes chequered, with black wing-bars, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>; or if not of a blue colour, yet with the several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks more or less plainly developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Boitard and Corbié[341] having asserted that from crosses between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or dovecot-pigeons, which, as we know, are blue birds with the usual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Eaton[342] matched two short-faced tumblers, namely, a splash cock and kite hen (neither of which are blue or barred), and from the first nest he got a perfect blue bird, and from the second a silver or pale blue bird, both of which, in accordance with all analogy, no doubt presented the usual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I also crossed a female black and white chequered trumpeter (of a different strain from the last) with a male almond-tumbler, neither of which exhibited a trace of blue, or of the white croup, or of the bar at end of tail: nor is it probable that the progenitors of these two birds had for many generations exhibited any of these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, for I have never even heard of a blue trumpeter in this country, and my almond-tumbler was purely bred; yet the tail of this mongrel was bluish, with a broad black bar at the end, and the croup was perfectly white.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let it be remembered that blue barbs are excessively rare; that spots, as has been already stated, were perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized in the year 1676, and breed perfectly true; this likewise is the case with white fantails, so much so that I have never heard of white fantails throwing any other colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless the offspring from the above two mongrels was of exactly the same blue tint as that of the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands over the whole back and wings; the double black wing-bars were equally conspicuous; the tail was exactly alike in all its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and the croup was pure white; the head, however, was tinted with a shade of red, evidently derived from the spot, and was of a paler blue than in the rock-pigeon, as was the stomach.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that two black barbs, a red spot, and a white fantail, as the four purely-bred grandparents, produced a bird of the same general blue colour, together with every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic mark, as in the wild _Columba livia_.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to crossed breeds frequently producing blue birds chequered with black, and resembling in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s both the dovecot-pigeon and the chequered wild variety of the rock-pigeon, the statement before referred to by MM.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wicking, who has had more experience than any other person in England in breeding pigeons of various colours: namely, that when a blue, or a blue and chequered bird, having black wing-bars, once appears in any race and is allowed to breed, these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to eradicate them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What, then, are we to conclude from this tendency in all the chief domestic races, both when purely bred and more especially when intercrossed, to produce offspring of a blue colour, with the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks, varying in the same manner, as in _Columba livia_? If we admit that these races have all descended from _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_, no breeder will doubt that the occasional appearance of blue birds thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised is accounted for on the well-known principle of "throwing back" or reversion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why crossing should give so strong a tendency to reversion, we do not with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> know; but abundant evidence of this fact will be given in the following chapters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, without obtaining a single blue or barred bird; yet by crossing these breeds I reared in the first and second generation, during the course of only three or four years, a considerable number of young birds, more or less plainly coloured blue, and with most of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Or secondly, we may assume that the aboriginal species {202} were all coloured blue, and had the wing-bars and other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks of _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_,--a supposition which is highly improbable, as besides this one species no existing member of the Columbidæ presents these combined <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and it would not be possible to find any other instance of several species identical in plumage, yet as different in important points of structure as are pouters, fantails, carriers, tumblers, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_ or from several aboriginal species, although they have been bred with so much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and are so highly valued by fanciers, have all been crossed within a dozen or score of generations with _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>livia_, and have thus acquired their tendency to produce blue birds with the several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic marks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a breed which has been crossed only once, the tendency to reversion will naturally become less and less in the succeeding generations, as in each there will be less and less of the blood of the foreign breed; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to some long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{203} To sum up the six foregoing arguments, which are opposed to the belief that the chief domestic races are the descendants of at least eight or nine or perhaps a dozen species; for the crossing of any less number would not yield the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences between the several races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Fourthly_, the extraordinary fact that man should, intentionally or by chance, have chosen for domestication several species, extremely abnormal in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and furthermore, the points of structure which render these supposed species so abnormal being now highly variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Sixthly_, the remarkable statements just given on the tendency in all the races, both when purely bred and when crossed, to revert in numerous minute details of colouring to the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the wild rock-pigeon, and to vary in a similar manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When these several facts and arguments are fairly taken into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, it would require an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us admit that the chief domestic races are descended from several aboriginal stocks; and of such evidence there is absolutely none.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Therefore I have argued the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of their origin at great, and, as some will think, superfluous length.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It has undergone a still greater amount of variation in the case of the numerous toy-pigeons, which no one supposes to be descended from distinct species; yet some of these toy-pigeons have transmitted their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> truly for centuries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His Majesty," says the courtly historian, "by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d them astonishingly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lockhart of Shangai, carriers, fantails, tumblers, and other varieties are reared with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, especially by the bonzes or priests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hear how an enthusiastic fancier at the present day writes: "If it were possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from Almond Tumblers, when they begin to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> their properties, I should think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without their aviaries of Almond Tumblers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[350] The pleasure thus taken is of paramount importance, as it leads amateurs <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to note and preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes their fancy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He will also soon see the good results of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>; for pigeons breed with extraordinary rapidity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of the cases are interesting as proving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the same or nearly the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and other cases are still more interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly modified during successive generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the last chapter I stated that Trumpeters and Laughers, both so remarkable for their voices, seem to have been perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized in 1735; and Laughers were apparently known in India before the year 1600.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' These breeds may all have existed for a much longer period; we know only that they were perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized at the dates above given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The _average_ length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about five or six years; if so, some of these races have retained their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--These birds, as far as a very short description serves for comparison, appear to have been well <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized in Aldrovandi's time,[352] before the year 1600.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Bult, the most successful breeder of Pouters in the world, informs me that at present (1858) the standard length of the body is not less than 18 inches; but he has measured one bird 19 inches in length, and has heard of 20 and 22 inches, but doubts the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of these latter statements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The extremely slight <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment in Pouters, except in the length of the leg, during the last 123 years, may be partly accounted for by the neglect which they suffered, as I am informed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In England, the number of the tail-feathers is not at present so much <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as their upward direction and expansion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The general carriage of the bird is likewise now much <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The old descriptions do not suffice to show whether in these latter <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s there has been much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment; but if fantails had formerly existed with their heads and tails touching each other, as at the present time, the fact would almost certainly have been noticed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--This breed existed before 1600, but the hood, judging from the figure given by Aldrovandi, did not enclose the head nearly so perfectly as at present: nor was the head then white; nor were the wings and tail so long, but this last <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> might have been overlooked by the rude artist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1795, judging from Bechstein, the breed had assumed its present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--It has generally been supposed by the older writers on pigeons, that the Turbit is the Cortbeck of Aldrovandi; but if this be the case, it is an extraordinary fact that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic frill should not have been noticed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Turbit, with its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic frill and bearing its present name, is described by Willughby in 1677; and the bill is said to be like that of the bullfinch,--a good comparison, but now more strictly applicable to the beak of the Barb.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This manner of flight is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of our present Tumblers, but it is clear that Belon would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described by him had tumbled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) that, "from great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and expense in breeding them, they have arrived to so great perfection and are so different from what they were 20 or 30 years past, that an old fancier would have condemned them for no other reason than because they are not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" {210} Hence it would appear that there was a rather sudden change in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the short-faced Tumbler at about this period; and there is reason to suspect that a dwarfed and half-monstrous bird, the parent-form of the several short-faced sub-breeds, then appeared.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I suspect this because short-faced Tumblers are born with their beaks (ascertained by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful measurement) as short, proportionally with the size of their bodies, as in the adult bird; and in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> they differ greatly from all other breeds, which slowly acquire during growth their various <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since the year 1765 there has been some change in one of the chief <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the short-faced Tumbler, namely, in the length of the beak.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Tumbler it may be concluded from the facts above given that it was originally introduced into Europe, probably first into England, from the East; and that it then resembled our common English Tumbler, or more probably the Persian or Indian Tumbler, with a beak only just perceptibly shorter than that of the common dovecot-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the short-faced Tumbler, which is not known to exist in the East, there can hardly be a doubt that the whole <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful change in the size of the head, beak, body, and feet, and in general carriage, has been produced during the last two centuries by continued selection, aided probably by the birth of a semi-monstrous bird somewhere about the year 1750.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To show how difficult it is to recognise some of the breeds described by Aldrovandi, I will give the different opinions in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the above four kinds, named by him _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Persica et Turcica_ of this author comes the nearest, but is said to have had a short thick beak; therefore it must have approached in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> a Barb, and have differed greatly from our Carriers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Any one now visiting a well-stocked English aviary would certainly pick out as the most distinct kinds, the massive Runt, the Carrier with its <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully elongated beak and great wattles, the Barb with its short broad beak and eye-wattles, the short-faced Tumbler {212} with its small conical beak, the Pouter with its great crop, long legs and body, the Fantail with its upraised, widely-expanded, well-feathered tail, the Turbit with its frill and short blunt beak, and the Jacobin with its hood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, if this same person could have viewed the pigeons kept before 1600 by Akber Khan in India and by Aldrovandi in Europe, he would have seen the Jacobin with a less perfect hood; the Turbit apparently without its frill; the Pouter with shorter legs, and in every way less remarkable--that is, if Aldrovandi's Pouter resembled the old German kind; the Fantail would have been far less singular in appearance, and would have had much fewer feathers in its tail; he would have seen excellent flying Tumblers, but he would in vain have looked for the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous short-faced breeds; he would have seen birds allied to barbs, but it is extremely doubtful whether he would have met with our actual Barbs; and lastly, he would have found Carriers with beaks and wattle incomparably less developed than in our English Carriers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As long as pigeons are kept semi-domesticated in dovecots in their native country, without any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in selecting and matching them, they are liable to little more variation than the wild _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a healthy and vigorous lot of pigeons many more young birds are killed for food or die than are reared to maturity; so that an individual having any peculiar <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, if not selected, would run a good chance of being destroyed; and if not destroyed, the {214} peculiarity in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> would almost certainly be obliterated by free intercrossing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When a bird presenting some conspicuous variation has been preserved, and its offspring have been selected, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully matched, and again propagated, and so onwards during successive generations, the principle is so obvious that nothing more need be said about it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This may be called _methodical selection_, for the breeder has a distinct object in view, namely, to preserve some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which has actually appeared; or to create some <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment already pictured in his mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fancier in the time of Aldrovandi, when in the year 1600 he admired his own jacobins, pouters, or carriers, never reflected what their descendants in the year 1860 would become; he would have been astonished could he have seen our jacobins, our <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d English carriers, and our pouters; he would probably have denied that they were the descendants of his own once admired stock, and he would perhaps not have valued them, for no other reason, as was written in 1765, "than because they were not like what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For these several races have been modified in various and even in directly opposite ways, though kept under the same climate and treated in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s in as nearly uniform a manner as possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" After remarking that the fancier of short-faced beard tumblers wishes for a very short beak, and that the fancier of long-faced beard tumblers wishes for a very long beak, he says, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to one of intermediate length, "Don't deceive yourself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the author just quoted remarks, "the fancy ebbs and flows; a thorough fancier now-a-days never stoops to breed toy-birds;" yet these very "toys" are now most <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully bred in Germany.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt, when breeds are neglected, they degenerate; still we may believe that, as long as they are kept under the same conditions of life, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s once gained will be partially retained for a long time, and may form, the starting-point for a future course of selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Let it not be objected to this view of the action of unconscious selection that fanciers would not observe or <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for extremely slight differences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those alone who have associated with fanciers can be thoroughly aware of their accurate powers of discrimination acquired by long practice, and of the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and labour which they bestow on their birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth, pigeons are likewise selected and matched with the greatest <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>* * * * * A difficulty with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the power of selection will perhaps already have occurred to the reader, namely, what could have led fanciers first to attempt to make such singular breeds as pouters, fantails, carriers, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We do not in the least know the origin of the common tumbler, but we may suppose that a bird was born with some affection of the brain, leading it to make somersaults in the air; and the difficulty in this case is lessened, as we know that, before the year 1600, in India, pigeons remarkable for their diversified manner of flight were much valued, and by the order of the Emperor Akber Khan were sedulously trained and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully matched.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus I have seen first-rate jacobins in one man's possession which certainly {218} differed slightly in several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s from those kept by another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The explanation no doubt lies in selection of a slightly different nature having been applied in each case; for no two fanciers have exactly the same taste, and consequently no two, in choosing and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully matching their birds, prefer or select exactly the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These important and correlated differences of structure do not invariably <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise any breed; but if they had been attended to and selected with as much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> as the more conspicuous external differences, there can hardly be a doubt that they would have been rendered constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If these latter <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s had once been rendered constant we should never have suspected that they had at first been highly variable, or that they had arisen from correlation, in the one case with the shortness of the wings, and in the other case with the length of the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how the chief domestic races have become distinctly separated from each other, it is important to bear in mind, that fanciers constantly try to breed from the best birds, and consequently that those which are inferior in the requisite qualities are in each generation neglected; so that after a time the less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d parent-stocks and many subsequently formed intermediate grades become extinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This has occurred in the case of the pouter, turbit, and trumpeter, for these highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d breeds are now left without any links closely connecting them either with each other or with the aboriginal rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In other countries, indeed, where the same <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> has not been applied, or where the same fashion has not prevailed, the earlier forms may long remain unaltered or altered only in a slight degree, and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the connecting links.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So again in Java, the fantail sometimes has only fourteen caudal feathers, and the tail is much less elevated and expanded than in our <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d birds; so that the Java bird forms a link between a first-rate fantail and the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The principle of divergence, together with the extinction of the many previously existing intermediate forms, is so important for <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the origin of domestic races, as well as of species in a state of nature, that I will enlarge a little more on this subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our third main group includes carriers, barbs, and runts, which are plainly related to each other, yet <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully distinct in several important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>According to the view given in the last chapter, these three races have probably descended from an unknown race having an intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and this from the rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences are believed to be due to different breeders having at an early period admired different points of structure; and then, on the acknowledged principle of admiring extremes, having gone on breeding, without any thought of the future, as good birds as they could,--carrier-fanciers preferring {221} long beaks with much wattle,--barb-fanciers preferring short thick beaks with much eye-wattle,--and runt-fanciers not caring about the beak or wattle, but only for the size and weight of the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How, it has been asked, can these losses be compensated, and more than compensated, for we know that with almost all domesticated animals the races have largely increased in number since the time of the Romans? But on the view here given, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> this apparent contradiction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In accordance with the belief of the great power of selection, and of the little direct power of changed conditions of life, except in causing general variability or plasticity of organisation, it is not surprising that dovecot-pigeons have remained unaltered from time immemorial; and that some toy-pigeons, which differ in little else besides colour from the dovecot-pigeon, have retained the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> for several centuries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For when one of these toy-pigeons had once become beautifully and symmetrically coloured,--when, for instance, a Spot had been produced with the crown of its head, its tail, and tail-coverts of a uniform colour, the rest of the body being snow-white,--no alteration or <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment would be desired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, it is not surprising that during this same interval of time our highly-bred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change; for in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the fancier, and there is no known limit to the variability of their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Notwithstanding the great <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment effected within recent times in the short-faced almond tumbler, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Eaton remarks, "the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago;" but this is perhaps an exaggerated assertion, for the young of all highly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d fancy birds are extremely liable to disease and death.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not likely that <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s selected by the caprice of man should resemble differences preserved under natural conditions, either from being of direct <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to each species, or from standing in correlation with other modified and <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able structures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the domestic races not roosting or building in trees, it is obvious that fanciers would never attend to or select such changes in habits; but we have seen that the pigeons in Egypt, which do not for some reason like settling on the low mud hovels of the natives, are led, apparently by compulsion, to perch in crowds on the trees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We may even affirm that, if our domestic races had become greatly modified in any of the above specified <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, and it could be shown that fanciers had never attended to such points, or that they did not stand in correlation with other selected <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, the fact, on the principles advocated in this chapter, would have offered a serious difficulty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the differences between these latter forms throw no light whatever on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which distinguish the domestic races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Selection is followed methodically when the fancier tries to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> and modify a breed according to a prefixed standard of excellence; or he acts unmethodically and unconsciously, by merely trying to rear as good birds as he can, without any wish or intention to alter the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The progress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect and ultimate extinction of the earlier and less <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms, as well as of many intermediate links in each long line of descent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus it has come to pass that most of our present races are so <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lously distinct from each other, and from the aboriginal rock-pigeon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHIEF BREEDS--ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR DESCENT FROM SEVERAL SPECIES--ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ALL THE BREEDS HAVING DESCENDED FROM GALLUS BANKIVA--REVERSION TO THE PARENT-STOCK IN COLOUR--ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS--ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE FOWL--EXTERNAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEVERAL BREEDS--EGGS--CHICKENS--SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS--WING- AND TAIL-FEATHERS, VOICE, DISPOSITION, ETC.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The following discussion on the origin of the various breeds and on their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences does not pretend to completeness, but may be of some interest to the naturalist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They differ from each other in different degrees, and do not afford <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in subordination to each other, by which they can be ranked in group under group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several breeds are abnormal in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; that is, they differ in certain points from all wild Gallinaceous birds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disposition {227} indomitably courageous, exhibited even in the hens and chickens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disposition savage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disposition extremely quiet.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Chickens feather late, but the young cocks show their masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and crow at an early age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There are several beautiful varieties which differ in colour and slightly in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disposition quiet.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Originally from Japan,[365] <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by small size alone; carriage bold and erect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--These are so variable in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>[366] that they hardly deserve to be called a breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--These are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by an almost monstrous shortness of legs, so that they move by jumping rather than by walking; they are said not to scratch up the ground.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The hens alone are thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Dixon[367] argues strongly on this side of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; and one fancier even denounces the opposite conclusion by asking, "Do we not perceive pervading this spirit, the spirit of the _Deist_?" Most naturalists, with the exception of a few, such as Temminck, believe that all the breeds have proceeded from a single species; but authority on such a point {231} goes for little.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are strongly impressed with the great difference between the chief kinds, and they ask with force, can differences in climate, food, or treatment have produced birds so different as the black stately Spanish, the diminutive elegant Bantam, the heavy Cochin with its many peculiarities, and the Polish fowl with its great top-knot and protuberant skull? But fanciers, whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of crossing the various breeds, do not sufficiently <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the probability of the occasional birth, during the course of centuries, of birds with abnormal and hereditary peculiarities; they overlook the effects of correlation of growth--of the long-continued use and disuse of parts, and of some direct result from changed food and climate, though on this latter head I have found no sufficient evidence; and lastly, they all, as far as I know, entirely overlook the all-important subject of unconscious or unmethodical selection, though they are well aware that their birds differ individually, and that by selecting the best birds for a few generations they can <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> their stocks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in a future chapter on Selection, abundant facts will be given showing not only that <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeding, but that actual selection was practised during ancient periods, and by barely civilised races of man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[370] Azara,[371] who wrote towards the close of the last century, states that in the interior parts of South America, where I should not have expected that the least <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> would have been taken of poultry, a black-skinned and black-boned breed is kept, from being considered fertile and its flesh good for sick persons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now every one who has kept poultry knows how impossible it is to keep several breeds distinct unless the utmost <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> be taken in separating the sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for poultry would merely wish to obtain, and afterwards to rear, the best birds which he could; but this occasional preservation of the best birds would in the course of time modify the breed, as surely, though by no means as rapidly, as does methodical selection at the present day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If one person out of a hundred or out of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds, this would be sufficient; for the birds thus tended would soon become superior to others, and would form a new strain; and this strain would, as explained in the last chapter, slowly have its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences augmented, and at last be converted into a new sub-breed or breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But breeds would often be for a time neglected and would deteriorate; they would, however, partially retain their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and afterwards might again come into fashion and be raised to a standard of perfection {233} higher than their former standard; as has actually occurred quite recently with Polish fowls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And after a time any such abnormal appearance would be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully preserved, from being <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a sign of the purity and excellence of the breed; for on this principle the Romans eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the white ear-lobe in their fowls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus from the occasional appearance of abnormal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, though at first only slight in degree; from the effects of the use and the disuse of parts; possibly from the direct effects of changed climate and food; from correlation of growth; from occasional reversions to old and long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; from the crossing of breeds, when more than one had once been formed; but, above all, from unconscious selection carried on during many generations, there is no insuperable difficulty, to the best of my judgment, in believing that all the breeds have descended from some one parent-source.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was at one time thought to be the primitive stock of all our domestic breeds, and this shows that it closely approaches the common fowl in general structure; but its hackles partially consist of highly peculiar, horny laminæ, transversely banded with three colours; and I have met with no authentic account of any such <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> having been observed {234} in any domestic breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>varius_ (or _furcatus_), which differs in so many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s--green plumage, unserrated comb, and single median wattle--that no one supposes it to have been the parent of any one of our breeds; yet, as I am informed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>bankiva_ agrees most closely with the black-breasted red Game-breed, in colouring and in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, except in being smaller, and in the tail being carried more horizontally.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Blyth, that wild specimens of the _Gallus bankiva_, brought from the countries east of the Bay of Bengal, are far more easily tamed than those of India; nor is this an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long ago remarked, the same species sometimes evinces a more tameable <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> in one country than in another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>bankiva_ was first tamed in Malaya and afterwards imported into India, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> an observation made to me by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Australia, with its islands, is out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as the home for unknown species of the genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the other gallinaceous {238} birds of Africa, it is not probable that Gallus is an African genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these several <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s we must look to the present metropolis of the genus, namely, to the south-eastern parts of Asia, for the discovery of species which were formerly domesticated, but are now unknown in the wild state; and the most experienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such species will be discovered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the case of pigeons, I have shown that purely-bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of distinct races frequently resemble, or revert to, the wild rock-pigeon in general colour and in each <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic mark.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tegetmeier's <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, a first-rate black Spanish cock, and hens of the following pure breeds,--white Game, white Cochin, silver-spangled Polish, silver-spangled Hamburgh, silver-pencilled Hamburgh, and white Silk.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus a young male bird from the silver-spangled Polish hen was in its first plumage coal-black, and combined in its comb, crest, wattle, and beard, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of both parents; but when two years old the secondary wing-feathers became largely and symmetrically marked with white, and, wherever in _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I reared several birds from the white Silk-hen by the Spanish cock: all were coal-black, and all plainly showed their parentage in having blackish combs and bones; none inherited the so-called silky feathers, and the non-inheritance of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has been observed by others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, even in trifling details of plumage, there was the closest accordance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Altogether it was a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous sight to compare this bird first with _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is so peculiar in many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s that some writers have considered it as specifically distinct; yet, as we now see, when crossed with the Spanish fowl, it yields offspring closely resembling the wild _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Orton, in our climate; that is, it reverts to the ordinary colour of the common fowl in its skin and bones, due <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> having been taken to prevent any cross.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a singular fact, considering that the male of no species of Gallus is in the least barred, that the cuckoo-like plumage has often been transferred to the male, more especially in the cuckoo Dorking; and the fact is all the more singular, as in gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs, in which pencilling is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the breed, the male is hardly at all pencilled, this kind of plumage being confined to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>bankiva_, such as Polish fowls, with their protuberant and little ossified skulls, and Cochins, with their imperfect tail and small wings, bear in these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s the plain marks of their artificial origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We know well that of late years methodical selection has greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and fixed many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and we have every reason to believe that unconscious selection, carried on for many generations, will have steadily augmented each new peculiarity and thus have given rise to new breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As soon as two or three breeds had once been formed, crossing would come into play in changing their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and in increasing their number.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Brent, indeed, considers all Aldrovandi's fowls as of impure breed; but it is a far more probable view that all our breeds since his time have been much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and modified; for, as he went to the expense of so many figures, he probably would have secured <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic specimens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Beginning with the eggs and chickens, I will pass on to the secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and then to the differences in external structure and in the skeleton.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I enter on the following details chiefly to show how variable almost every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has become under domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The eggs, however, of the different breeds vary considerably in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; for instance, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would appear that darker-coloured eggs <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise the breeds which have lately come from the East, or are still closely allied to those now living there.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--As the young of almost all gallinaceous birds, even of the black curassow and black grouse, whilst covered with down, are longitudinally striped on the back,--of which <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, when adult, neither sex retains a trace,--it might have been expected that the chickens of all our domestic fowls would have been similarly striped.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fowls which are entirely black, namely Spanish, black Game, black Polish, and black Bantams, display a new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, for their chickens have their breasts and throats more or less white, with sometimes a little white elsewhere.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The primordially striped <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is retained by the chickens of most of the Game sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon); by Dorkings; by the partridge and grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins (Brent), but not, as we have seen, by all the other sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay (Dixon), but apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these facts we see that the chickens of the different breeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much in their downy plumage; and, although longitudinal stripes <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise the young of all wild gallinaceous birds, they disappear in several domestic breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the period of life at which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s proper to each breed first appear, it is obvious that such structures as additional toes must be formed long before birth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[401] Cochins are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by a small tail, and in the young cocks the tail is developed at an unusually late period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[402] Game fowls are notorious for their pugnacity; and the young cocks crow, clap their little wings, and obstinately fight with each other, even whilst under their mother's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the same manner, it is probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the Spanish cock has been unintentionally transferred to the young cocks; for fanciers would not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> whether their young birds had large combs, but would select for breeding the adults which had the finest combs, whether or not developed at an early period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_Secondary Sexual Characters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In pencilled Hamburghs, on the other hand, there is much dissimilarity; the pencilling which is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the hens being almost absent in the males of both the golden and silver varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It is a singular fact that the males in certain sub-breeds have lost some of their secondary masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and, from their close resemblance in plumage to the females, are often called hennies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That they are not quite sterile, and that the whole case is widely different from that of old females assuming masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, is evident from several of these hen-like sub-breeds having been long propagated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A hen-tailed sub-breed of Hamburghs was recently much <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This bird has now retained the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during five seasons, and has begot both hen-feathered and male-feathered offspring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[409] I have remarked in my 'Origin of Species' that secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are apt to differ much in the species of the same genus, and to be unusually variable in the individuals of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So it is with the breeds of the fowl, as we have already seen, as far as the colour of plumage is concerned, and so it is with the other secondary sexual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Firstly, the comb differs much in the various breeds,[410] and its form is eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of each kind, with the exception of the Dorkings, in which the form has not been as yet determined on by fanciers, and fixed by selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sickle-feathers in the tail, of which there are three pair, and which are eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the male sex, differ much in the various breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sultans are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by an additional number of lateral sickle-feathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Judging from the differences which generally distinguish the sexes in the Gallinaceæ, certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in our domestic fowls appear to have been transferred from the one sex to the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all the species (except in Turnix), when there is any conspicuous difference in plumage between the male and female, the male is always the most beautiful; but in golden-spangled Hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the cock, and incomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural species of Gallus; so that here a masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has been transferred to the female.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[414] From this latter case, and from some facts presently to be given with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the protuberance of the skull in Polish fowls, the crest in this breed ought perhaps to be viewed as a feminine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which has been transferred to the male.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In Game-fowls the bold and savage <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the male has likewise been largely transferred to the female;[415] and she sometimes even possesses the eminently masculine <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of spurs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He mentions also another breed similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized, in which the hens are excellent layers, but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to their spurs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The males and females, on the other hand, of the black-boned European breed, with silky feathers, do not differ from each other; so that in the one breed black skin and bones, and the same kind of plumage, are common to both sexes, whilst in the other breed these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are confined to the female sex.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter author has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully described the effects of a crest on the skull not only in fowls, but in ducks, geese, and canaries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence there can be no doubt that this remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the skulls of Polish fowls was formerly in Germany confined to the female sex, but has now been transferred to the males, and has thus become common to both sexes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[419] A good observer[420] states that a first-rate silver-spangled Hamburgh hen gradually lost the most <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic qualities of the breed, for the black lacing to her feathers disappeared, and her legs changed from leaden-blue to white; but what makes the case remarkable is, that this tendency ran in the blood, for her sister changed in a similar but less strongly marked manner; and chickens produced from this latter hen were at first almost pure white, "but on moulting acquired black collars and some spangled feathers with almost obliterated markings;" so that a new variety arose in this singular manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the different breeds is widely different, varying from the savage and defiant temper of the Game-cock to the extremely peaceable temper of the Cochin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some {260} writers speak of the Spanish as one of the most distinct breeds, and so it is in general aspect; but its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences are not important.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences of the Cochin breed are more or less variable, and may be detected in a greater or lesser degree in other breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_ The feathered legs, often furnished with an additional toe, the wings incapable of flight, the extremely quiet <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, indicate a long course of domestication; and these fowls come from China, where we know that plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with extraordinary <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and where consequently we might expect to find profoundly modified domestic races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a Bantam or Jumper from Burmah these same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are more strongly pronounced, and the supra-occiput is more pointed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are less developed in the hens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the most remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is the shape of the occipital foramen: in _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] Of _Dorkings_ I have examined three skulls, one belonging to the white sub-breed; the one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> deserving notice is the breadth of the frontal bones, which are moderately furrowed in the middle; thus in a skull which was less than once and a half the length of that of _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These peculiarities no doubt stand in close relation with the broad flattened rose-comb <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Hamburgh breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as is shown in the two longitudinal sections, {263} which deserve attentive <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tegetmeier: it resembles a Polish skull in most of its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, but has not the great frontal protuberance; it has, however, two rounded knobs of a different nature, which stand more in front, above the lachrymal bones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can be no doubt that in former times the breeder of Polish fowls attended solely to the crest, and not to the skull; nevertheless, by increasing the crest, in which he has <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully succeeded, he has unintentionally made the skull protuberant to an astonishing degree; and through correlation of growth, he has at the same time affected the form and relative connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of the orifice of the nose, the breadth of the frontal bones, the shape of the post-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones, the direction of the axis of the bony cavity of the ear, and lastly the internal configuration of the whole skull together with the shape of the brain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared each separate bone of the leg and wing, relatively to the same bones in the wild Bankiva, in the following breeds, which I thought were the most likely to differ; namely, in Cochin, Dorking, {269} Spanish, Polish, Burmese Bantam, Frizzled Indian, and black-boned Silk fowls; and it was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process, articulation, and pore agreed, though the bones differed greatly in size.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In stating this, I do not refer to the relative thickness and length of the several bones; for the tarsi varied considerably in both these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, I have not examined a sufficient number of skeletons to say whether any of the foregoing differences, except in the skull, are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the several breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the skull, the deep medial furrow in the frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen seem to be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Cochins; as is the great breadth of the frontal bones in Dorkings; the separation and open spaces between the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillaries and nasal bones, as well as the front part of the skull being but little depressed, <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ise Hamburghs; the globular shape of the posterior part of the skull seems to be <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of laced Bantams; and lastly, the protuberance of the skull with the ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially aborted, together with the other differences before specified, are eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Polish and other Crested fowls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To a certain extent we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the skeleton fluctuates so much in structure; fowls have been exposed to unnatural conditions of life, and their whole organisation has thus been rendered variable; but the breeder is quite indifferent to, and never intentionally selects, any modifications in the skeleton.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>External <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, if not attended to by man,--such as the number of the tail and wing feathers and their relative lengths, which in wild birds are generally constant points,--fluctuate in our domestic fowls in the same manner as the several parts of the skeleton.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An additional toe is a "point" in Dorkings, and has become a fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but is variable in {270} Cochins and Silk-fowls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The colour of the plumage and the form of the comb are in most breeds, or even sub-breeds, eminently fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; but in Dorkings these points have not been attended to, and are variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When any modification in the skeleton is related to some external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which man values, it has been, unintentionally on his part, acted on by selection, and has become more or less fixed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see this in the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful protuberance of the skull, which supports the crest of feathers in Polish fowls, and which by correlation has affected other parts of the skull.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" We know not in the least whether additional ribs, or the changed outline of the occipital foramen, or the changed form of the scapula, or of the extremity of the furcula, are in any way correlated with other structures, or have arisen from the changed conditions and habits of life to which our fowls have been subjected; but there is no reason to doubt that these various modifications in the skeleton could be rendered, either by direct selection, or by the selection of correlated structures, as constant and as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of each breed, as are the size and shape of the body, the colour of the plumage, and the form of the comb.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In every specimen, after disarticulating and cleaning the bones, I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared the relative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other, and of the two main bones of the leg to each other, with those of _G.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, we may conclude with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the various breeds of the fowl, that the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a very slight degree; that they have {274} certainly become lighter relatively to the leg-bones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not unnaturally short or delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to which the pectoral muscles are attached, has invariably become less prominent, the whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The comb when of any peculiar shape, as with Horned, Spanish, and Hamburgh fowls, affects in a corresponding manner the underlying skull; and we have seen how <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully this is the case with Crested fowls when the crest is largely developed.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Varies much in colour and in proportions, and differs in instincts and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> from the wild-duck.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[440] Unless we deny that domestication, prolonged during centuries, can affect even such unimportant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s as colour, size, and in a slight degree proportional dimensions and mental <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, there is no reason whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from the common wild species, for the one differs from the other in no important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have some historical evidence with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the period and progress of the domestication of the duck.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In Sweden this experiment was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully tried by Tiburtius; he succeeded in rearing wild ducks for three generations, but, though they were treated like common ducks, they did not vary even in a single feather.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Young birds are easily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam; but to succeed it is indispensable not to place the eggs of both the wild and tame duck under the same hen, for in this case "the young wild ducks die off, leaving their more hardy brethren in undisturbed possession of their foster-mother's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference of habit at the onset in the newly-hatched ducklings almost entails such a result to a <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The wild ducklings were from the first quite tame towards those who took <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of them as long as they wore the same clothes, and likewise to the dogs and cats of the house.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hewitt found that his young birds always changed and deteriorated in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the course of two or three generations; notwithstanding that great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> was taken to prevent any crossing with tame ducks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have given these details, because no other case, as far as I know, has been so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully recorded by a competent observer of the progress of change in wild birds reared for several generations in a domestic condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From these <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s there can hardly be a doubt that the wild duck is the parent of the common domestic kind; nor need we look to distinct species for the parentage of the more distinct breeds, namely, Penguin, Call, Hook-billed, Tufted, and Labrador ducks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will not repeat the arguments used in the previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient times domesticated several species since become unknown or extinct, though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild state;--on some of the supposed parent-species having had abnormal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in comparison with all the other species of the genus, as with hook-billed and penguin ducks;--on all the breeds, as far as is known, being fertile together;[445]--on all the breeds having the same general <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, instinct, &c.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But one fact bearing on this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species alone, namely, the male of {280} _A.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>boschas_, has its four middle tail-feathers curled upwardly; now in every one of the above-named domestic breeds these curled feathers exist, and on the supposition that they are descended from distinct species, we must assume that man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Penguins, I have not seen many specimens, and none were coloured precisely like the wild duck; but Sir James Brooke sent me three skins from Lombok and Bali, in the Malayan archipelago; the two females were paler and more rufous than the wild duck, and the drake differed in having the whole under and upper surface (excepting the neck, tail-coverts, tail, and wings) silver-grey, finely pencilled with dark lines, closely like certain parts of the plumage of the wild mallard.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless the climate of the Malayan archipelago apparently does tend to cause the duck to vary much, for Zollinger,[447] speaking of the Penguin breed, says that in Lombok "there is an unusual and very <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful variety of ducks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will now notice some of the peculiarities <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the several breeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This loquacity seems at first a surprising <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to have been acquired under domestication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" As the loquacity of the Call-duck is highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, these birds being used in decoys, this quality may have been increased by selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] _Osteological Characters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so many other bones, I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they presented no difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the two following tables, I may first state that I tested them by taking another skeleton of a wild duck and of a common domestic duck, and by comparing the weight of _all_ the bones of the leg with _all_ those of the wings, and the result was the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The one exceptional case, namely, in one of the Call-ducks, is in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> no exception, for this bird was constantly in the habit of flying about: and I have seen it day after day rise from my grounds, and fly for a long time in circles of more than a mile in diameter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the goose has varied in some degree, we may infer from naturalists not being unanimous with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its wild parent-form; though the difficulty is chiefly due to the existence of three or four closely allied wild European species[456].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s seem at first good indications of a cross at some former period with the white-fronted goose (_A.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>albifrons_); but the white ring is variable in this latter species, and we must not overlook the law of analogous variation; that is, of one species assuming some of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of allied species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[463] This latter fact deserves attention, because the colour of the legs and beak is highly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able in discriminating the several closely allied wild forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Waterhouse <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared, as he informs me, skins of the wild Indian and domestic bird, and they were identical in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, except that the plumage of the latter was perhaps rather thicker.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is one strange fact with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the peacock, namely, the occasional appearance in England of the "japanned" or "black-shouldered" kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>cristatus_ and _muticus_, nevertheless they are in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between these two species; and this fact favours, as Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newton, states that, five or six years ago, a female bird, in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s similar to the female of the black-shouldered kind, was produced from a stock of common peacocks in his possession, which during more than twenty years had not been crossed with birds of any other strain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>nigripennis_, but had lost every trace of the cross, yet that the birds occasionally produced offspring which suddenly and completely reacquired through reversion the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of _P.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To perceive the full improbability of such an occurrence, we may suppose that a breed of dogs had been crossed at some former period with a wolf, but had lost every trace of the wolf-like <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, yet that the breed gave birth in five instances in the same country, within no great length of time, to a wolf perfect in every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and we must further suppose that in two of the cases the newly produced wolves afterwards spontaneously increased to such an extent as to lead to the extinction of the parent-breed of dogs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is an interesting case, as with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> a new breed might probably have been formed; and a topknot of this nature would have been to a certain extent analogous to that borne by the males in several allied genera, such as Euplocomus, Lophophorus, and Pavo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This small change is worth notice on account of the often-repeated statement that all feral animals invariably revert in every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to their original type.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> deserves notice from being confined to one period of life and from being strictly inherited at the same period: namely, the wing and tail feathers in prize canaries being black, "but this colour is retained only until the first moult; once moulted, the peculiarity ceases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[483] Canaries differ much in <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and in some small degree in song.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One variety is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by a hump on its back near the head; and the Rev.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For example; what a difference in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> one may perceive to exist between the bees of the Lüneburg heath and those of this country!".</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I procured a hive full of dead bees from Jamaica, where they have long been naturalised, and, on <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully comparing them under the microscope with my own bees, I could detect not a trace of difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lowe propagated this variety, but unfortunately did not separate the stock from his other bees, and after three generations the new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was almost completely lost.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This case shows us what could probably be effected by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and long-continued selection applied exclusively to the workers, for, as we have seen, queens and drones cannot be selected and paired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These insects are in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s interesting to us, more especially because they have varied largely at early periods of life, and the variations have been inherited at corresponding periods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the value of the silk-moth depends entirely on the cocoon, every change in its structure and qualities has been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to, and races differing much in the cocoon, but hardly at all in the adult state, have been produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is reason to believe that the nature of the food given to the caterpillar influences to a certain extent the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the breed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> taken in Europe in the selection of the best cocoons and moths for breeding is notorious,[501] and the production of eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of France.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Robinet's excellent work,[503] which bears every sign of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and large experience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the breeds which live in temperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately hatched by artificial heat, yet when they are removed to and reared in a hot country they gradually acquire the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of quick development, as in the Trevoltini races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the general colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of the silk,[505] this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed {302} by cultivators, and has not been fixed by selection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is probably the first step in reversion towards the tiger-like marks, and I was curious to know whether so trifling a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> would be inherited; at my request she separated in 1848 twenty of these caterpillars, and having kept the moths separate, bred from them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The cocoon in the different races presents <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences; being large or small;--nearly spherical with no constriction, as in the _Race de Loriol_, or cylindrical with either a deep or slight constriction in the middle;--with the two ends, or with one end alone, more or less pointed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>According to Robinet, the white race, called Sina, by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful selection during the last seventy-five years, "est arrivée à un tel état de pureté, qu'on ne voit pas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons blancs.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it should be observed that he does not include in his list several plants which present ill-defined <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, namely, the various forms of pumpkins, millet, sorghum, kidney-bean, dolichos, capsicum, and indigo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similar facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the collection of seeds of wild grasses in other parts of the world could be given.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The next step in cultivation, and this would require but little forethought, would be to sow {310} the seeds of useful plants; and as the soil near the hovels of the natives[528] would often be in some degree manured, <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties would sooner or later arise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if these plants have been so greatly modified and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by culture as no longer closely to resemble any natural species, we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why the above-named countries have given us no useful plants, for they were either inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all, as in Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, or who cultivated it very imperfectly, as in some parts of America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker[533] enumerates no less than 107 such species in Australia alone; but these plants have not been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, and consequently cannot compete with those which have been cultivated and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d during thousands of years in the civilised world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Had North America been civilized for as long a period, and as thickly peopled, as Asia or Europe, it is probable that the native vines, walnuts, mulberries, crabs, and plums, would have given rise, after a long course of cultivation, to a multitude of varieties, some extremely different from their parent-stocks; and escaped seedlings would have caused in the New, as in the Old World, much perplexity with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their specific distinctness and parentage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Godron's remark, that, supposing these plants to be escaped seedlings,[539] if they have propagated themselves in a wild state for several generations, their continued resemblance to cultivated wheat renders it probable that the latter has retained its aboriginal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to oats, according to Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Buckman,[540] the wild English _Avena fatua_ can be converted by a few years of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful cultivation and selection into forms almost identical with two very distinct cultivated races.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not improbable that, besides the kinds known in Europe, other strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised forms exist in the more distant parts of the world; for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps[541] speaks of three new species or varieties, sent to Europe in 1822 from Chinese Mongolia, which he considers as being there indigenous.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If those botanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat originally existed, then the amount of variation in any important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight; but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed, then it is evident that varieties so strongly marked have arisen, that they have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference, and in certain Gramineæ serves even as a generic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>;[545] although, as remarked by Godron,[546] the presence of barbs is variable in certain wild grasses, and especially in those, such as _Bromus secalinus_ and _Lolium temulentum_, which habitually grow mingled with our cereal crops, and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[548] As wheat is an annual, we thus see how strictly many trifling differences in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> are inherited through many generations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Colonel Le Couteur insists strongly on this same fact: in his persevering and successful attempts to raise new varieties by selection, he began by choosing the best ears, but soon found that the grains in the same ear differed so that he was compelled to select them separately; and each grain generally transmitted its own <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[550] As in the case of many other plants, some varieties, both old and new, are far more constant in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the tendency to vary, Metzger[551] gives from his own experience some interesting facts: he describes three Spanish sub-varieties, more especially one known to be constant in Spain, which in Germany assumed their proper <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> only during hot summers; another variety kept true only in good land, but after having been cultivated for twenty-five years became more constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He mentions two other sub-varieties which were at first inconstant, but subsequently became, apparently without any selection, accustomed to their new homes, and retained their proper <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the natural crossing of distinct varieties the evidence is conflicting, but preponderates against its frequent occurrence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In accordance with the principles of selection we can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it is that in the several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation differ so little; for if a plant {318} with peculiar leaves appeared, it would be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time superior in quality or size.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The selection of seed-corn was strongly recommended[561] in ancient times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil says,-- "I've seen the largest seeds, tho' view'd with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, Degenerate, unless th' industrious hand Did yearly cull the largest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We now know that man was sufficiently civilized to cultivate the ground at an immensely remote period; so that wheat might have been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d long ago up to that standard of excellence which was possible under the then existing state of agriculture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One small class of facts supports this view of the slow and gradual <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment of our cereals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By taking great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> at first, the southern kinds after some years' culture ripen their seed perfectly in their northern homes, so that this is an analogous case with that of the conversion of summer into winter wheat, and conversely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the seed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, {324} do they differ, being a little longer and narrower than usual.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter variety is a new one, and bears the same relation to common broccoli, as Brussel-sprouts do to common cabbages; it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli, and was found faithfully to transmit its newly-acquired and remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact is the more remarkable as great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> must be taken to prevent the crossing of the different kinds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One kind, however, called "Cottager's Kale," has lately been produced by crossing common kale and Brussel-sprouts, recrossed with purple broccoli,[586] and is said to be true, but plants {325} raised by me were not nearly so constant in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as any common cabbage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although most of the kinds keep true if <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully preserved from crossing, yet the seed-beds must be yearly examined, and a few seedlings are generally found false; but even in this case the force of inheritance is shown, for, as Metzger has remarked[587] when speaking of Brussel-sprouts, the variations generally keep to their "unter art," or main race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[588] Extremely poor soil also affects the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of certain varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated animals, the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no light on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences between the cultivated forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If our cabbages are the descendants of three or four distinct species, every trace of any sterility which may originally have existed between them is now lost, for none of the varieties can be kept distinct without scrupulous <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to prevent intercrossing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[594] This latter plant, in its cultivated state, differs in scarcely any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the wild English species, except in general luxuriance and in the size and quality of its roots; but in the root ten varieties, differing in colour, shape, and quality, are cultivated[595] in England, and come true by seed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is that variations in this part alone have been selected; and the seedlings inheriting a tendency to vary in the same way, analogous modifications have been again and again selected, until at last a great amount of change has been effected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Alefeld has recently studied[597] the genus with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and, after having cultivated about fifty varieties, concludes that they all certainly belong to the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The pods and seeds, which with natural species afford such constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, differ greatly in the cultivated varieties of the pea; and these are the valuable, and consequently the selected parts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the value of the differences between the chief varieties, it cannot be doubted that, if one of the tall _Sugar-peas_, with purple flowers, thin-skinned pods of an extraordinary shape, including large, dark-purple peas, grew wild by the side of the lowly _Queen of the Dwarfs_, with white flowers, greyish-green, rounded leaves, scimitar-like pods, containing oblong, smooth, pale-coloured peas, which became mature at a different season; or by the side of one of the gigantic sorts, like the _Champion of England_, with leaves of great size, pointed pods, and large, green, crumpled, almost cubical peas,--all three kinds would be ranked as indisputably distinct species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Masters informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to lose their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Masters also raised from a plant of another variety four distinct sub-varieties, which bore blue and round, white and round, blue and wrinkled, and white and wrinkled peas; and although he sowed these four varieties separately during several successive years, each kind always reproduced all four kinds mixed together! With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the varieties not naturally intercrossing, I have ascertained that the pea, which in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> differs from some other Leguminosæ, is perfectly fertile without the aid of insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet I have seen <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>-bees whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and become so thickly dusted with pollen, that some could hardly fail to be left on the stigma of the next flower which was visited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Beans (_Faba vulgaris_), I will say but little.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Alefeld has given[606] short diagnostic <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of forty varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The flowers vary in size, and in colour between white and purple, but in no other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, except that in one kind the sepals were somewhat elongated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[611] {331} The tubers, on the other hand, present a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful amount of diversity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anderson[613] procured seed from an Irish purple potato, which grew far from any other kind, so that it could not at least in this generation have been crossed, yet the many seedlings varied in almost every possible <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, so that "scarcely two plants were exactly alike.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--CUCURBITACEOUS PLANTS--WONDERFUL VARIATION OF.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[616] Some authors, however, entertain much doubt about the single parentage of our cultivated varieties, owing to the number of semi-wild forms found in Southern Europe, especially as described by Clemente,[617] in a forest in Spain; but as the grape sows itself freely in Southern Europe, and as several of the chief kinds transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s by seed,[618] whilst others are extremely variable, the existence of many different escaped forms could hardly fail to occur in countries where this plant has been cultivated from the remotest antiquity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>{333} Van Mons[620] reared a multitude of varieties from the seed of one vine, which was completely separated from all others, so that there could not, at least in this generation, have been any crossing, and the seedlings presented "les analogues de toutes les sortes," and differed in almost every possible <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> both in the fruit and foliage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will merely specify a few curious and trifling peculiarities, all taken from Odart's highly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed work,[621] for the sake of showing the diversified variability of this plant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Barbera d'Asti is well marked by several <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Several authors in classifying grapes have founded their main divisions on the berries being either round or oblong; and Odart admits the value of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; yet there is one variety, the Maccabeo (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>429) present a constant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, sufficient for their <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>, namely, "the slight adherence of that part of the pulp which surrounds the seeds to the rest of the berry, when cut through transversely.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many other variable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s could be given, but the foregoing facts are sufficient to show in how many small structural and {334} constitutional details the vine varies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--I mention this plant because it has varied in certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, namely, in the texture and quality of the leaves, fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated silkworm, in a manner not observed with other plants; but this has arisen simply from such variations in the mulberry having been attended to, selected, and rendered more or less constant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>De Candolle,[627] on the other hand--and there cannot be a more capable judge--<strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s what he considers sufficient evidence of the orange (he doubts whether the bitter and sweet kinds are specifically distinct), the lemon, and citron, having been found wild, and consequently that they are distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides the ever-recurrent difficulty of determining whether forms found wild are truly aboriginal or are escaped seedlings, many of the forms, which must be ranked as varieties, transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s almost perfectly by seed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> except in the flavour of their fruit, but Gallesio[628] is most emphatic that both kinds can be propagated by seed with absolute <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>De Candolle informs me that since the publication of his great work he has received accounts from Guiana, the Antilles, and Mauritius, that in these countries sweet oranges faithfully transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The supposition, however, that the peach is a modified almond which acquired its present <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> at a comparatively late period, would, I presume, account for these facts; on the same principle that the nectarine, the offspring of the peach, has few native names, and became known in Europe at a still later period.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this gradation, from the cases of sudden variation above recorded, and from the fact that the peach has not been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that the peach is the descendant of the almond, <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and modified in a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gallesio[643] says he has verified this with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to eight races of the peach.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, however, contrary to what might have been expected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the glands on the leaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[646] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to nectarines, both cling and {340} freestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by seed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this strong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine trees exhibit,--from certain slight constitutional differences[649] in their nature,--and from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the trees differ in no other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s and cannot even be distinguished, as I am informed by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[655] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the more curious case of full-grown peach-trees suddenly producing nectarines by bud-variation (or sports as they are called by gardeners), the evidence is superabundant; there is also good evidence of the same tree producing both peaches and nectarines, or half and half fruit;--by this term I mean a fruit with the one-half a perfect peach, and the other half a perfect nectarine.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both classes the kinds differ from each other in the flesh of the fruit being white, red, or yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the flowers being large or small, with certain other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences; and in the leaves being serrated without glands, or crenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Clingstone and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Finally, there is good reason to believe that the peach is an almond profoundly modified; but whatever its origin may have been, there can be no doubt that it has yielded during the last eighteen centuries many varieties, some of them strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, belonging both to the nectarine and peach form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the stone we have more important differences, and these in the case of the plum have been <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed of specific value: in some apricots the stone is almost spherical, in others much flattened, being either sharp in front or blunt at both ends, sometimes channelled along the back, or with a sharp ridge along both margins.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Moorpark, and generally in the Hemskirke, the stone presents a singular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in being perforated, with a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most constant and important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, according to Thompson, is whether the kernel is bitter or sweet; yet in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> we have a graduated difference, for the kernel is very bitter in Shipley's apricot; in the Hemskirke less bitter than in some other kinds; slightly bitter in the Royal; and "sweet like a hazel-nut" in the Breda, Angoumois, and others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rivers[683] seedling apricots deviate but little from the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of {345} their race: in France the Alberge is constantly reproduced from seed with but little variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From what we know of the variability of the flowers in the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various fruit-trees, it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter {346} <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the shape of the fruit, we have conclusive evidence that it is extremely variable: Downing[688] gives outlines of the plums of two seedlings, namely, the red and imperial gages, raised from the greengage; and the fruit of both is more elongated than that of the greengage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from seeds are generally of high systematic importance, I have thought it worth while to give drawings of the most distinct kinds in my small collection; and they may be seen to differ in a surprising manner in size, outline, thickness, prominence of the ridges, and state of surface.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" There are two kinds of damson, one the Shropshire with downy shoots, and the other the Kentish with smooth shoots, and these differ but slightly in any other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>: Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thompson[694] has classified the varieties in an apparently natural method in two main groups by <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s taken from the flowers, fruit, and leaves; but some varieties which stand widely separate in this classification are quite fertile when crossed; thus Knight's Early Black cherry is the product of a cross between two such kinds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some varieties present singular <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s: thus the flower of the Cluster cherry includes as many as twelve pistils, of which the majority abort; and they are said generally to produce from two to five or six cherries aggregated together and borne on a single peduncle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--The one source of doubt felt by botanists with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the parentage of the apple is whether, besides _P.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But perhaps the strangest constitutional peculiarity is that the Winter Majetin is not attacked by the mealy bug or coccus; Lindley[707] states that in an orchard in Norfolk infested with these insects the Majetin was quite free, though the stock on which it was grafted was affected: Knight makes a similar statement with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to a cider apple, and adds that he only once saw these insects just above the stock, but that three days afterwards they entirely disappeared; this apple, however, was raised from a cross between {350} the Golden Harvey and the Siberian Crab; and the latter, I believe, is considered by some authors as specifically distinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[710] Yet it is a mistake to suppose that with most varieties the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are not to a certain extent inherited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Decaisne, has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully studied the many varieties;[712] although he formerly believed that they were derived from more than one species, he is now convinced that all belong to one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has arrived at this conclusion from finding in the several varieties a perfect gradation between the most extreme <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; so perfect is this gradation that he maintains it to be impossible to classify the varieties by any natural method.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Decaisne raised many seedlings from four distinct kinds, and has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully recorded the variations in each.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Notwithstanding this extreme degree of {351} variability, it is now positively known that many kinds reproduce by seed the leading <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of their race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--This fruit is remarkable, on account of the number of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment within the last fifty or sixty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Another sub-variety, the White Bush Alpine, is similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, but when propagated by seed it often degenerates and produces plants with runners.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thompson in classifying the fruit for the Horticultural Society found less confusion in the nomenclature of the gooseberry than of any other fruit, and he attributes this "to the great interest which the prize-growers have taken in detecting sorts with wrong names," and this shows that all the kinds, numerous as they are, can be recognised with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>was attained; there was no <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> till 1825, when 31 dwts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>; in 1841 "Wonderful" weighed 32 dwts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This gradual, and on the whole steady increase of weight from the latter part of the last century to the year 1852, is probably in large part due to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d methods of cultivation, for extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is now taken; the branches and roots are trained, composts are made, the soil is mulched, and only a few berries are left on each bush;[742] but the increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued selection of seedlings which have been found to be more and more capable of yielding such extraordinary fruit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These three species are closely allied, and have the same general habit, but their innumerable varieties can always be distinguished, according to Naudin, by certain almost fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; and what is still more important, when crossed they yield no seed, or only sterile seed; whilst the varieties spontaneously intercross with the utmost freedom.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>15), that, though these three species have varied greatly in many <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, yet it has been in so closely an analogous manner that the varieties can be arranged in almost parallel series, as we have seen with the forms of wheat, with the two main races of the peach, and in other cases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though some of the varieties are inconstant in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, yet others, when grown separately under uniform conditions of life, are, as Naudin repeatedly (pp.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>43, 63), has such prepotency in transmitting its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that when crossed with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The seeds also differ in a slight degree in shape, and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully in size (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those naturalists who believe in the immutability of species often maintain that, even in the most variable forms, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s which they consider of specific value are unchangeable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Now let it be noted what a difference, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the immutability of the so-called specific <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, this paragraph produces on the mind, from that above quoted from M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will add another remark: naturalists continually assert that no important organ varies; but in saying this they unconsciously argue in a vicious circle; for if an organ, let it be what it may, is highly variable, it is <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as unimportant, and under a systematic point of view this is quite correct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The enlarged form of the stigmas, and their sessile position on the summit of the ovary, must be considered as important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and were used by Gasparini to separate certain pumpkins as a _distinct genus_; but Naudin says (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Nor is the creation of so many species at all surprising when we consider how strictly their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s are transmitted by seed, and how <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully they differ in appearance: "Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo magis fructuum," says Naudin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Several varieties of the melon are interesting from assuming the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic features of distinct species and even of distinct though allied genera: thus the serpent-melon has some resemblance to the fruit of _Trichosanthes anguina_; we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers; some Egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the pulp, and this is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of certain wild forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the Continent, however, where the forests are more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully attended to than in England, Alph.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>De Candolle[760] says that there is not a forester who does not search for seeds from that variety which he <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>s the most valuable.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"[769] I will add only one other remarkable case of variation in foliage, namely, the occurrence of two sub-varieties of the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves, and which generally transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by seed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--I allude to this tree as it bears on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees compared with those under strictly natural conditions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What does a florist <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for the shape and structure of the organs of fructification, unless, indeed, they add to the beauty of the flower? When this is the case, flowers become modified in important points; stamens and pistils may be converted into petals, and additional petals may be developed, as in all double flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful poppy has been described, in which the stamens are converted into pistils; and so strictly was this peculiarity inherited that, out of 154 seedlings, one alone reverted to the ordinary and common type.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[787] Of the cock's-comb (_Celosia cristata_), which is an annual, there are several races in which the flower-stem is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully "fasciated" or compressed; and one has been exhibited[788] actually eighteen inches in breadth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Peloric races of _Gloxinia speciosa_ and _Antirrhinum majus_ can be propagated by seed, and they differ in a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful manner from the typical form both in structure and appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If florists had attended to, selected, and propagated by seed other modifications of structure besides those which are beautiful, a host of curious varieties would certainly have been raised; and they would probably have transmitted their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s so truly that the cultivator would have felt aggrieved, as in the case of culinary vegetables, if his whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The genus Rosa is a notoriously difficult one, and, though some of the above forms are admitted by all botanists to be distinct species, others are doubtful; thus, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the British forms, Babington makes seventeen, and Bentham only five species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As almost all the aboriginal forms brought from different countries have been crossed and recrossed, it is no <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that Targioni-Tozzetti, in speaking of the common roses of the Italian gardens, remarks that "the native country and precise form of the wild type of most of them are involved in much un<strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thomson, cultivated them together with some common garden varieties, and soon effected a great <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" {369} Hence, after having <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully compared numerous varieties, I gave up the attempt as too difficult for any one except a professed botanist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Most of the varieties present such inconstant <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, that when grown in poor soil, or when flowering out of their proper season, they produce differently coloured and much smaller flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cultivators speak of this or that kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by this they do not mean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by seed, but that the individual plant does not change much under culture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The differences in the form of the nectary more especially deserve notice; because <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s derived from this organ have been much used in the discrimination of most of the species of Viola.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Paul remarks that "it is interesting to compare the Hyacinths of 1629 with those of 1864, and to mark the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the several kinds of hyacinths differ but slightly from each other except in colour, yet each kind has its own individual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which can be recognised by a highly educated eye; thus the writer of the Amsterdam treatise asserts (p.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[812] Many plants long cultivated in tropical {372} countries, such as the Banana, have produced numerous varieties; but as these have never been described with even moderate <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, they also are here passed over.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[818] Count Odart describes a variety which often bears on the same stalk small round and large oblong berries; though the shape of the berry is generally a fixed <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I shall hereafter give {377} cases of apple-trees which regularly produce fruit of two kinds, or half-and-half fruit; these trees are generally supposed, and probably with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, to be of crossed parentage, and that the fruit reverts to both parent-forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Many cases have been recorded of a whole plant, or single branch, or bud, suddenly producing flowers different from the proper type in colour, form, size, doubleness, or other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[828] The Pompone variety often bears "four distinguishable kinds of flowers,--the pure white and the red-eyed, which appear promiscuously; the brindled pink and the rose-coloured, which may be kept separate with tolerable <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> by grafting from the branches that bear them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter remarks, "every sport should be thoroughly tested in different soils before it can be really considered as fixed, as many have been known to run back when planted in rich compost; but when sufficient <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and time are expended in proving, there will exist little danger of subsequent disappointment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Caspary has <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully described[854] the case of a six-year-old white moss-rose, which sent up several suckers, one of which was thorny, and produced red flowers, destitute of moss, exactly like those of the Provence rose (_R.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[855] The double and highly-coloured Belladonna rose has been known[856] to produce by suckers both semi-double and almost single white roses; whilst suckers from one of these semi-double white roses reverted to perfectly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised Belladonnas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[857] Many cases {381} have been recorded of roses suddenly becoming striped or changing their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by segments: some plants of the Comtesse de Chabrillant, which is properly rose-coloured, were exhibited in 1862,[858] with crimson flakes on a rose ground.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rivers, as I am informed by him, possessed a new French rose with delicate smooth shoots, pale glaucous-green leaves, and semi-double pale flesh-coloured flowers striped with dark red; and on branches thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised there suddenly appeared, in more than one instance, the famous old rose called the Baronne Prevost, with its stout thorny shoots, and immense, uniformly and richly coloured, double flowers; so that in this case the shoots, leaves, and flowers, all at once changed their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by bud-variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) occasionally vary by layers; and some kinds are so little certain in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> that they are called by floriculturists "catch-flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to trees, the history of but few of the many varieties with curious or ornamental foliage is known; but several probably have originated by bud-variation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Mason states, "for many years has had one bough of a totally different <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to the rest of the tree, or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being short-jointed and densely covered with foliage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[872] I have often noticed single twigs and branches on beech and other trees with their leaves fully expanded before those on the other branches had opened; and as there was nothing in their exposure or <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to account for this difference, I presume that they had appeared as bud-variations, like the early and late fruit-maturing varieties of the peach and nectarine.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[873] With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to colour, leaves often become by bud-variation zoned, blotched, or spotted with white, yellow, and red; and this occasionally occurs even with plants in a state of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Plants which have become variegated as seedlings, generally transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by seed to a large proportion of their progeny; and Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter found, after repeated trials, that he could not propagate them by "root-joints," whereas, the variegated _Tussilago farfara_ can thus be safely propagated;[879] but this latter plant may have originated as a variegated seedling, which would account for its greater fixedness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Turning now to tubers: in the common Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) a single bud or eye sometimes varies and produces a new variety; or, occasionally, and this is a much more remarkable circumstance, all the eyes in a tuber vary in the same manner and at the same time, so that the whole tuber assumes a new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[883] Several cases have been recorded of large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He believes that English growers, from <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in choosing seed from broken flowers instead of from plain flowers, have to a certain extent diminished the tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or secondary reversion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, on the other hand, there is this difference--that in ordinary cases of bud-variation, one bud alone changes, whilst in the foregoing cases all the buds on the same plant were modified together; yet we have an intermediate case, for with the potato all the eyes in one tuber alone simultaneously changed their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[895] It is notorious that the <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d varieties of the Heartsease (_Viola tricolor_) when transplanted often produce flowers widely different in size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a large uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it then produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower petals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple spots, and ultimately, towards the end of the same summer, by the original large dark purple flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, we have the case of young fruit-trees changing their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as they grow old; seedling pears, for instance, lose with age their spines and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> in the flavour of their fruit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In another, one of the dingy-red wing-petals had a bright yellow narrow stripe on it; and lastly, in another flower, one of the stamens, which had become slightly foliaceous, was half yellow and half purple; so that the tendency to segregation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> or reversion affects even single parts {388} and organs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Herbert from such seed[900] exhibited a purple tinge on the stalks of their flowers; but several seedlings raised by myself resembled in every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> the common laburnum, with the exception that some of them had remarkably long racemes: these seedlings were perfectly fertile.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That such purity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and fertility should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridized and sterile a form is an astonishing phenomenon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>purpureus_; but on <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful comparison I found that they differed from the pure species in the shoots being thicker, the leaves a little broader, and the flowers slightly shorter, with the corolla and calyx less brightly purple: the basal part of the standard-petal also plainly showed a trace of the yellow stain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So that the flowers, at least in this instance, had not perfectly recovered their true <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; and in accordance with this, they were not perfectly fertile, for many of the pods contained no seed, some produced one, and very few contained as many as two seeds; whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>purpureus_; but this expression shows that they had not perfectly recovered their proper <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Purser states[904] that a common laburnum-tree in his garden, into which three _grafts_ of the _Cytisus purpureus_ had been inserted, gradually assumed the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of _C.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Adam's account, we must admit the extraordinary fact that two distinct species can unite by their cellular tissue, and subsequently produce a plant bearing leaves and sterile flowers intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between the scion and stock, and producing buds liable to reversion; in short, resembling in every important <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> a hybrid formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The two plants produced from the two embryos were "extremely different in appearance and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>," though both resembled other hybrids of the same parentage produced at the same time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gallesio, who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examined several living specimens and compared them with the description given by the original describer P.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This tree can be propagated by cuttings, and retains its diversified <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the bizzarria, many authors believe that it is a graft-hybrid; Gallesio on the other hand thinks that it is an ordinary hybrid, with the habit of partially reverting {392} by buds to the two parent-forms; and we have seen in the last chapter that the species in this genus often cross spontaneously.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hybrids between _Tropæolum minus_ and _majus_[913] at first produced flowers intermediate in size, colour, and structure between their two parents; but later in the season some of these plants produced flowers in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s like those of the mother-form, mingled with flowers still retaining the usual intermediate condition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It may be worth mentioning that I fertilised the _Purple Sweet-pea_ (_Lathyrus odoratus_) with pollen from the light-coloured _Painted Lady_: seedlings raised from one and the same pod were not intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, but perfectly resembled both parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a future chapter I shall show that, with animals of crossed parentage, the same individual has been known to change its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during growth, and to revert to one of its parents which it did not at first resemble.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>* * * * * We will now consider the few facts which have been recorded in support of the belief that a variety when grafted or budded on another variety sometimes affects the whole stock, or at the point of junction gives rise to a bud, or graft-hybrid, which partakes of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of both stock and scion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This variety has been propagated, and has preserved its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during the last fifty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I should not have quoted the following case had not the author of 'Des Jacinthes'[926] impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive knowledge, but of his <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>fulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, and that they will grow together and throw up a united stem (and this I have myself seen), with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trail stated in 1867, before the Botanical Society of Edinburgh (and has since given me fuller information), that several years ago he cut about sixty blue and white potatoes into halves through the eyes or buds, and then <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully joined them, destroying at the same time the other eyes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Poynter,[927] who assures me, in a letter of the entire accuracy of the statement, _Rosa Devoniensis_ had been budded some years previously on a white Banksian rose; and from the much enlarged point of junction, whence the Devoniensis and Banksian still continued to grow, a third branch issued, which was neither pure Banksian nor pure Devoniensis, but partook of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of both; the flowers resembled, but were superior in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to those of the variety called _Lamarque_ (one of the Noisettes), while the shoots were similar in their manner of growth to those of the Banksian rose, with the exception that the longer and more robust shoots were furnished with prickles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the extraordinary tendency which this tree exhibits to complete or partial reversion, we have seen that undoubted seminal hybrids and mongrels are similarly liable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although it is at present impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the origin of these remarkable trees, the various facts above given appear to me to deserve attention under several points of view, more especially as showing that the power of reversion is inherent in Buds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[929] These statements led Gärtner, who was highly sceptical on the subject, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to try a long series of experiments: he selected the most constant varieties, and the result conclusively showed that the colour of the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently coloured variety is used.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The valves of the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger than those of the pods of the mother-plant, but this may have been an accidental circumstance, for I know not how far their thickness in the Tall Sugar-pea is a variable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I give the following case the more readily, as Gärtner doubted similar statements with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the stock previously made by other observers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most remarkable instance, because <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully recorded by highly competent authorities, is one of which I have seen an account in a letter written, in 1867, by M.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fruit or drupe thus produced was twice as large as, and more elongated than, that proper to the Chamærops; so that it was intermediate in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, as well as in texture, between the fruit of the two parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These hybridised seeds germinated, and produced young plants likewise intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gallesio[933] fertilised the flowers of an orange with pollen from the lemon; and one fruit thus produced bore a longitudinal stripe of peel having the colour, flavour, and other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the lemon.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the United States, where Cucurbitaceæ are largely cultivated, it is the popular belief[935] that the fruit is thus directly affected by foreign pollen; and I have received a similar statement with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to {400} the cucumber in England.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Savi[938] tried the experiment with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>: he sowed yellow and black-seeded maize together, and on the same ear some of the seeds were yellow, some black, and some mottled,[939] the differently coloured seeds being arranged in rows or irregularly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a future chapter we shall see {401} that the organs of vegetation in hybrid plants, independently of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of either parent, are sometimes developed to a monstrous size; and the increased size of the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous fact.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Valery apple, which, from the abortion of the stamens, does not produce pollen, but, being annually fertilised by the girls of the neighbourhood with pollen of many kinds, bears fruit, "differing from each other in size, flavour, and colour, but resembling in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> the hermaphrodite kinds by which they have been fertilised.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, we must not overrate the efficacy of pollen in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>; for in the case of hybridised plants it might be argued that an embryo had been formed and had affected the surrounding tissues of the mother-plant before it perished at a very early age.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the offspring subsequently begot by the black Arabian horse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the varieties of our domesticated animals, many similar and well-authenticated facts have been published,[950] and others have been communicated to me, plainly showing the influence of the first male on the progeny subsequently borne by the mother to other males.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similar cases have so frequently occurred, that <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful breeders avoid putting a choice female to an inferior male on account of the injury to her subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The analogy from the direct action of foreign pollen on the ovarium and seed-coats of the mother-plant strongly supports the belief that the male element acts directly on the reproductive organs of the female, <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful as is this action, and not through the intervention of the crossed embryo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With birds there is no such close connection between the embryo and mother as in the case of mammals: yet a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful observer, Dr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>_--The facts given in the latter half of this chapter are well worthy of <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, as they show us in how many extraordinary modes one organic form may lead to the modification of another, and often without the intervention of seminal reproduction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is a considerable but insufficient body of evidence showing that the tissues of two plants may unite and form a bud having a blended <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; or again, that buds inserted into a stock may affect all the buds subsequently produced by this stock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Offspring from a cross between two species or varieties may in the first or in a succeeding generation revert in various degrees by bud-variation to their parent-forms; and this reversion or segregation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> may affect the whole flower, fruit, or leaf-bud, or only the half or smaller segment, or a single organ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In some cases this segregation of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> apparently depends on some {406} incapacity of union rather than on reversion, for the flowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of both parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the _Cytisus adami_ and the Bizzarria orange, whatever their origin may have been, the two parent species occur blended together under the form of a sterile hybrid, or reappear with their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s perfect and their reproductive organs effective; and these trees, retaining the same sportive <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, can be propagated by buds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the early half of this chapter I have given a long list of plants in which through bud-variation, that is, independently of reproduction by seed, the fruit has suddenly become modified in size, colour, flavour, hairiness, shape, and time of maturity; flowers have similarly changed in shape, colour, and doubleness, and greatly in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the calyx; young branches or shoots have changed in colour, in bearing spines, and in habit of growth, as in climbing and weeping; leaves have changed in colour, variegation, shape, period of unfolding, and in their arrangement on the axis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the list, many of the cases are certainly due to reversion to <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s not acquired from a cross, but which were formerly present, and have been lost for a longer or shorter period of time;--as when a bud on a variegated plant produces plain leaves, or when variously-coloured flowers on the Chrysanthemum revert to the aboriginal yellow tint.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, there is no known natural species or seedling variety, from which the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> could have been derived by crossing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The varieties which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from seedlings; this is notoriously the case with the varieties of the Rose, Azalea, and many other plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if we turn to the other end of the series, namely, to such cases as that of a peach-tree which, after having been cultivated by tens of thousands during many years in many countries, and after having annually produced thousands of buds, all of which have apparently been exposed to precisely the same conditions, yet at last suddenly produces a single bud with its whole <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> greatly transformed, we are driven to an opposite {409} conclusion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is well known that, out of a number of seedling varieties, some transmit their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> much more truly by seed than others; so with bud-varieties some retain their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by successive buds more truly than others; of which instances have been given with two kinds of variegated Euonymus and with certain kinds of tulips.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Notwithstanding the sudden production of bud-varieties, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s thus acquired are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction: Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rivers has found that moss-roses generally {410} reproduce themselves by seed; and the mossy <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> has been transferred by crossing, from one species of rose to another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter, that seed taken from a branch with leaves variegated through bud-variation, transmits this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> very feebly; whilst many plants, which became variegated as seedlings, transmit variegation to a large proportion of their progeny.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Rivers with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to fruit-trees, and to Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to flowers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter informs me that with flowers such do occur, but, if propagated, they generally lose their new <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the following year; yet he concurs with me that bud-variations usually at once assume a decided and permanent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can hardly doubt that this is the rule, when we reflect on such cases as that of the peach, which has been so <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed and of which such trifling seminal varieties have been propagated, yet this tree has repeatedly produced by bud-variation nectarines, and only twice (as far as I can learn) any other variety, namely, the Early and Late Grosse Mignonne peaches; and these differ from the parent-tree in hardly any <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> except the period of maturity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Salter that he brings the great principle of selection to bear on variegated plants propagated by buds, and has thus greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d and fixed several varieties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> and fix such varieties, he finds it necessary to encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly marked leaves, and to propagate from them alone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This resemblance, or rather identity, is rendered far more striking if the facts can be trusted which apparently render it probable that the cellular tissue of one species or variety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We see that bud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to long-lost <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, or to those formerly acquired from a cross, but that it is often spontaneous.</li>
