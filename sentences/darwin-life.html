<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN By Charles Darwin Including An Autobiographical Chapter Edited By His Son Francis Darwin VOLUME I PREFACE In choosing letters for publication I have been largely guided by the wish to illustrate my father's personal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But his life was so essentially one of work, that a history of the man could not be written without following closely the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er of the author.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In arranging the letters I have adhered as far as possible to chronological sequence, but the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and variety of his researches make a strictly chronological order an impossibility.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In writing to a friend, or to one of his family, he frequently omitted the articles: these have been inserted without the usual indications, except in a few instances, where it is of special interest to preserve intact the hurried <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the letter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have not followed the originals as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the spelling of names, the use of capitals, or in the matter of punctuation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During the last eight years of his life I acted as his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, and thus had an opportunity of knowing something of his habits and methods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have received much <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> from my friends in the course of my work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The readers of these pages will, I think, be grateful to Sir Joseph for the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> with which he has preserved his valuable collection of letters, and I should wish to add my acknowledgment of the generosity with which he has placed it at my disposal, and for the kindly encouragement given throughout my work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Huxley I owe a debt of thanks, not only for much kind <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>, but for his willing compliance with my request that he should contribute a chapter on the reception of the 'Origin of Species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is always interesting to see how far a man's personal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics can be traced in his forefathers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor, it appears, had Erasmus the love of exercise and of field-sports, so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Charles Darwin as a young man, though he had, like his grandson, an indomitable love of hard mental work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Benevolence and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with others, and a great personal charm of manner, were common to the two.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Charles Darwin possessed, in the highest degree, that "vividness of <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>" of which he speaks as strongly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Erasmus, and as leading "to his overpowering tendency to theorise and generalise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither had Charles Darwin the literary <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong> which made Erasmus a poet as well as a philosopher.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" These, indeed, seem indications of traits most strikingly prominent in his own <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet we get no evidence in Erasmus of the intense <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> and simplicity that marked Charles Darwin's whole nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the whole, however, it seems to me that we do not know enough of the essential personal tone of Erasmus Darwin's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to attempt more than a superficial comparison; and I am left with an impression that, in spite of many resemblances, the two men were of a different type.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Schimmelpenninck have misrepresented Erasmus Darwin's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) It is, however, extremely probable that the faults which they exaggerate were to some extent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the man; and this leads me to think that Erasmus had a certain acerbity or severity of temper which did not exist in his grandson.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' The Aesculapian Society awarded him its first gold medal for an experimental <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> on pus and mucus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"About the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his second son, Erasmus (born 1759), I have little to say, for though he wrote poetry, he seems to have had none of the other tastes of his father.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> was quiet and retiring.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Charles Darwin had the strongest feeling of love and <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for his father's memory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> for him was boundless and most touching.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Litchfield remembers him saying that he hoped none of his sons would ever believe anything because he said it, unless they were themselves convinced of its <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>,--a feeling in striking contrast with his own manner of faith.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Perhaps this incident shows what I think is the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that the memory of his father he loved the best, was that of him as an old man.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>She describes him as saying with the most tender <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, "I think my father was a little unjust to me when I was young, but afterwards I am thankful to think I became a prime favourite with him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His chief mental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics were his powers of observation and his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, neither of which have I ever seen exceeded or even equalled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> was not only with the distresses of others, but in a greater degree with the pleasures of all around him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father heard his reasons for believing that he could ultimately repay the money, and from [his] intuitive perception of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> felt sure that he was to be trusted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So he <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d this sum, which was a very large one for him while young, and was after a time repaid.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I suppose that it was his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> which gave him unbounded power of winning confidence, and as a consequence made him highly successful as a physician.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"But the most remarkable power which my father possessed was that of reading the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and even the thoughts of those whom he saw even for a short time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It saved my father from ever making (with one exception, and the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of this man was soon discovered) an unworthy friend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin, who told you; we thought that no human being knew the fact except ourselves!' My father told me the story many years after the event, and I asked him how he distinguished the true from the false self-accusations; and it was very <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of my father that he said he could not explain how it was.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed why a cheese should be sent her from Bowood, but thought nothing more about it until it flashed across his mind many years afterwards, whilst Lord Shelburne was talking about Holland.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he admitted and <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d instances of certain persons who could drink largely during their whole lives without apparently suffering any evil effects, and he believed that he could often beforehand tell who would thus not suffer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When patients who were very ill craved for some strange and unnatural food, my father asked them what had put such an idea into their heads; if they answered that they did not know, he would allow them to try the food, and often with success, as he trusted to their having a kind of instinctive desire; but if they answered that they had heard that the food in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> had done good to some one else, he firmly refused his assent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father took a different view and maintained that the gentleman would recover: he was proved quite wrong in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s (I think by autopsy) and he owned his error.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This he sometimes found difficult to do compatibly with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>P--, who said, 'From all that I have seen and heard of you I believe that you are the sort of man who will speak the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, and if I ask, you will tell me when I am dying.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' My father acquiesced on the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing that his words should in fact have no meaning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>E -- was a rather great man, and universally <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed, no inquest was held over his body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think I gained much from him intellectually; but his example ought to have been of much moral <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to all his children.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of his golden rules (a hard one to follow) was, 'Never become the friend of any one whom you cannot <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The following note on his brother's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was written by Charles Darwin at about the same time that the sketch of his father was added to the 'Recollections.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Erasmus Darwin's name, though not known to the general public, may be remembered from the sketch of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in Carlyle's 'Reminiscences,' which I here reproduce in part:-- "Erasmus Darwin, a most diverse kind of mortal, came to seek us out very soon ('had heard of Carlyle in Germany, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My dear one had a great favour for this honest Darwin always; many a road, to shops and the like, he drove her in his cab (Darwingium Cabbum comparable to Georgium Sidus) in those early days when even the charge of omnibuses was a <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, and his sparse utterances, sardonic often, were a great amusement to her.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am tempted by the wish of illustrating further the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of one so sincerely beloved by all Charles Darwin's children, to reproduce a letter to the "Spectator" (September 3, 1881) by his cousin Miss Julia Wedgwood.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Carlyle's portfolio not regretted by any who loved the original, surely confers sufficient distinction to warrant a few words of notice, when the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> it depicts is withdrawn from mortal gaze.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They remember it with the same distinctness as they remember a creation of genius; it has in like manner enriched and sweetened life, formed a common meeting-point for those who had no other; and, in its strong fragrance of individuality, enforced that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for the idiosyncracies of human <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> without which moral judgment is always hard and shallow, and often unjust.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not possible to transfer the impression of a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; we can only suggest it by means of some resemblance; and it is a singular illustration of that irony which checks or directs our sympathies, that in trying to give some notion of the man whom, among those who were not his kindred, Carlyle appears to have most loved, I can say nothing more descriptive than that he seems to me to have had something in common with the man whom Carlyle least appreciated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On another side of his nature, I have often been reminded of him by the quaint, delicate humour, the superficial intolerance, the deep springs of pity, the peculiar mixture of something pathetic with a sort of gay scorn, entirely remote from contempt, which distinguish the Ellesmere of Sir Arthur Helps' earlier dialogues.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> is not merged in the creation; and what we lose in the power to communicate our impression, we seem to gain in its vividness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To many this may seem an impossibility; but those who knew my father will <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it was not only possible, but natural.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The autobiography bears the heading, 'Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,' and end with the following note:-- "Aug.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] A German Editor having written to me for an account of the development of my mind and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> with some sketch of my autobiography, I have thought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest my children or their children.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember in the early part of my school life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed earnestly to God to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> me, and I well remember that I attributed my success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>led how generally I was aided.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To my deep mortification my father once said to me, "You <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for nothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all your family.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Looking back as well as I can at my <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> during my school life, the only qualities which at this period promised well for the future, were, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever interested me, and a keen pleasure in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing any complex subject or thing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle of the vernier of a barometer with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to diversified tastes, independently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare, generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Early in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the <strong style='color: red'>veracity</strong> of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the "Beagle".</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I think that my <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> was then very affectionate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to science, I continued collecting minerals with much zeal, but quite unscientifically--all that I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d about was a new-NAMED mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I must have observed insects with some little <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, for when ten years old (1819) I went for three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in Shropshire.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In my simplicity I remember <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He made all the gases and many compounds, and I read with great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> several books on chemistry, such as Henry and Parkes' 'Chemical Catechism.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he called me very unjustly a "poco curante," and as I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why this part of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what medicines to give, which I made up myself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father, who was by far the best judge of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> whom I ever knew, declared that I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would get many patients.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty regularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> about them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I looked at him and at the whole scene with some <strong style='color: red'>awe</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these Societies, more than any other similar honour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful stone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I think of this lecture, I do not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that I determined never to attend to Geology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To hear of praise from an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity, is, I think, good for a young man, as it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>s to keep him in the right course.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Accordingly I read with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to be a clergyman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and some time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings, in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a public discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump of <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> developed enough for ten priests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> something of the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to Classics I did nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the attendance was almost nominal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education of my mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By answering well the examination <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were all in the highest spirits, I cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> looking back to these times with much pleasure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was the mere passion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared their external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s with published descriptions, but got them named anyhow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er more than any other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my brother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly prepared to <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot resist mentioning a trifling incident, which showed his kind <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now I do not suppose any other professor of botany could have <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed laughing at my coming in such a hurry to make such a communication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But he agreed how interesting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me clearly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how well it was known; so I left him not in the least mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so remarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to communicate my discoveries.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I became also acquainted with several other men older than me, who did not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> much about science, but were friends of Henslow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>D<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>s, afterwards Dean of Hereford, and famous for his success in the education of the poor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During my last year at Cambridge, I read with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and profound interest Humboldt's 'Personal Narrative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Herschel's 'Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,' stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I copied out from Humboldt long passages about Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned excursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and D<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>s, for on a previous occasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the party declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think that they were only half in earnest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I was then utterly astonished at Sedgwick not being delighted at so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful a fact as a tropical shell being found near the surface in the middle of England.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We spent many hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, as Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw a trace of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and terminal moraines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Afterwards, on becoming very intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fitz-Roy's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was a singular one, with very many noble features: he was devoted to his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and indomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would undertake any sort of trouble to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> those whom he thought deserved <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> was in several <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s one of the most noble which I have ever known.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The voyage of the "Beagle" has been by far the most important event in my life, and has determined my whole <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er; yet it depended on so small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to Shrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as the shape of my nose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the first real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of observation were <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d, though they were always fairly developed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had brought with me the first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied attentively; and the book was of the highest <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to me in many ways.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jago in the Cape de Verde islands, showed me clearly the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful superiority of Lyell's manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author, whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> when in after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in describing <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good practice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That my mind became developed through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark made by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a sceptical <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for on first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and exclaimed, "Why, the shape of his head is quite altered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I could not at the time <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how he could have learnt anything of my proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had read some of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical Society of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held November 16, 1835, and printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members of the Society.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All this shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that in after years, though I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d in the highest degree for the approbation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I did not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> much about the general public.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) on December 13th, where all my collections were under the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of Henslow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Journal had been written with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, and my chief labour was making an abstract of my more interesting scientific results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One of his chief <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics was his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the interest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to him my views on coral reefs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During this time I saw also a good deal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his breakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of curious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related to minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had therefore only to verify and extend my views by a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful examination of living reefs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This necessarily led me to reflect much on the effects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> the continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will give my impressions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His mind was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised, as it appeared to me, by clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He would <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> all possible objections to my suggestion, and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A second <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic was his hearty <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the work of other scientific men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This I did, and believe now that it was the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I felt a high <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> for Sir J.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He told me that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to each, of the facts which he thought might prove <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to him, and that he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his memory was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I asked him how at first he could judge what facts would be <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able, and he answered that he did not know, but that a sort of instinct guided him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether his pictures of men were true ones is another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man well fitted to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He thought it a most ridiculous thing that any one should <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little slower, or moved at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many of the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole group.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter discovery has at last been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to attribute the whole account to my fertile <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>During the voyage of the "Beagle" I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by the South American <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to be very ancient in a geological sense.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I worked on true Baconian principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale, more especially with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to domesticated productions, by printed enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by extensive reading.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as they become modified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d very little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace; and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Within late years several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s more correctly than I did.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Sprengel's <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' For some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to other plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With Lythrum we have the still more <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful case of three forms standing in a similar relation to one another.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An unverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if any one should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, as an astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and rendered intelligible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to have paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to his origin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this time forward I occasionally attended to the subject, both with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to man and our domesticated animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation' was published in the autumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe, the endless and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful contrivances for the transportal of pollen from one plant to another of the same species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus Darwin' published, and I added a sketch of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and habits from material in my possession.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r full.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have said that in one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> my mind has changed during the last twenty or thirty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, novels which are works of the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, though not of a very high order, have been for years a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relief and pleasure to me, and I often bless all novelists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed by my fellow naturalists.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From my early youth I have had the strongest desire to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> or explain whatever I observed,--that is, to group all facts under some general laws.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is advisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few men, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment or observations, which would have proved directly or indirectly <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author from several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a full complement of seed, although the parent plants had been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully protected from the access of insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The account was published in a most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able Journal, that of the Royal Society of Belgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why, except that there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding animals made me think this very improbable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, I give them in the hope that they may <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to preserve that impression of his <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> which remains on the minds of those who knew and loved him--an impression at once so vivid and so untranslatable into words.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He could dissect well under the simple microscope, but I think it was by dint of his great patience and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fulness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of him that he thought many little bits of skilful dissection something almost superhuman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He used to speak with admiration of the skill with which he saw Newport dissect a <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> bee, getting out the nervous system with a few cuts of a fine pair of scissors, held, as my father used to show, with the elbow raised, and in an attitude which certainly would render great steadiness necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He used to consider cutting sections a great feat, and in the last year of his life, with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful energy, took the pains to learn to cut sections of roots and leaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When he was excited with pleasant talk his whole manner was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully bright and animated, and his face shared to the full in the general animation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was delightfully tender to Polly, and never showed any impatience at the attentions she required, such as to be let in at the door, or out at the verandah window, to bark at "naughty people," a self-imposed <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> she much enjoyed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have heard my father say that the charm of this simple little valley <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to make him settle at Down.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is curious to think how, with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the Sand-walk in connection with my father, my earliest recollections coincide with my latest; it shows how unvarying his habits have been.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A Spitz dog which accompanied him showed no sign of excitement at the fox, and he used to end the story by <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing how the dog could have been so faint-hearted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> personifying natural things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He would speak in a half-provoked, half-admiring way of the <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> of a Mimosa leaf in screwing itself out of a basin of water in which he had tried to fix it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In telling the story he was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to add that he thought they were not quite so wild as English snipe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was much impressed, so that I know now the place where the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> was asked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" His letters were generally written on the assumption that they would be <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessly read; thus, when he was dictating, he was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful to tell me to make an important clause begin with an obvious paragraph "to catch his eye," as he often said.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How much he thought of the trouble he gave others by asking <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, will be well enough shown by his letters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hacon, his solicitor, <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful young man got a civil answer, though I think he did not get much material for his speech.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He sometimes expressed surprise that so few people thanked him for his books which he gave away liberally; the letters that he did receive gave him much pleasure, because he habitually formed so <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> an estimate of the value of all his works, that he was generally surprised at the interest which they excited.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In money and business matters he was remarkably <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and exact.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He kept accounts with great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, classifying them, and balancing at the end of the year like a merchant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the blank sheets of letters received were kept in a portfolio to be used in making notes; it was his <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for paper that made him write so much on the backs of his old MS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His feeling about paper extended to waste paper, and he objected, half in fun, to the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less custom of throwing a spill into the fire after it had been used for lighting a candle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My father was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully liberal and generous to all his children in the matter of money, and I have special cause to remember his kindness when I think of the way in which he paid some Cambridge debts of mine--making it almost seem a virtue in me to have told him of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had a great <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for pure business capacity, and often spoke with admiration of a relative who had doubled his fortune.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> in the extreme about his own taste, and correspondingly pleased when he found that others agreed with him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He took a vivid interest both in plot and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, and would on no account know beforehand, how a story finished; he considered looking at the end of a novel as a feminine vice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This way of looking at himself as an ignoramus in all matters of art, was strengthened by the absence of pretence, which was part of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of taste, as well as to more serious things, he always had the courage of his opinions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In spite of his want of grammar, he managed to get on <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully with German, and the sentences that he failed to make out were generally really difficult ones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He never attempted to speak German correctly, but pronounced the words as though they were English; and this made it not a little difficult to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him, when he read out a German sentence and asked for a translation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the non-biological sciences he felt keen <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with work of which he could not really judge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have often heard him say that he got a kind of satisfaction in reading articles which (according to himself) he could not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think it was all due to the vitality and persistence of his mind--a quality I have heard him speak of as if he felt that he was strongly gifted in that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not that he used any such phrases as these about himself, but he would say that he had the power of keeping a subject or <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> more or less before him for a great many years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1871 he went to the little village church for the wedding of his elder daughter, but he could hardly bear the fatigue of being present through the short <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The discomfort of a journey to him was, at least latterly, chiefly in the anticipation, and in the miserable sinking feeling from which he suffered immediately before the start; even a fairly long journey, such as that to Coniston, tired him <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully little, considering how much an invalid he was; and he certainly enjoyed it in an almost boyish way, and to a curious extent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was always rejoiced to get home after his holidays; he used greatly to enjoy the welcome he got from his dog Polly, who would get wild with excitement, panting, squeaking, rushing round the room, and jumping on and off the chairs; and he used to stoop down, pressing her face to his, letting her lick him, and speaking to her with a peculiarly tender, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ssing voice.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Richardson's 'Lecture on Charles Darwin,' October 22, 1882, from which I quote:-- "In a public institution like mine, he was surrounded, of course, by multifarious types of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, by persons of both sexes, mostly very different from himself--commonplace people, in short, as the majority are everywhere, but like to him at least in this, that they were fellow-creatures and fellow-patients.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The 'Expression of the Emotions' shows how closely he watched his children; it was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of him that (as I have heard him tell), although he was so anxious to observe accurately the expression of a crying child, his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> with the grief spoiled his observation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live, the impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From whatever point I look back at her, the main feature in her <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> which at once rises before me, is her buoyant joyousness, tempered by two other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics, namely, her sensitiveness, which might easily have been overlooked by a stranger, and her strong affection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even when playing with her cousins, when her joyousness almost passed into boisterousness, a single glance of my eye, not of displeasure (for I thank God I hardly ever cast one on her), but of want of <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>, would for some minutes alter her whole countenance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"The other point in her <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, which made her joyousness and spirits so delightful, was her strong affection, which was of a most clinging, fondling nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>She often used exaggerated language, and when I quizzed her by exaggerating what she had said, how clearly can I now see the little toss of the head, and exclamation of 'Oh, papa what a shame of you!' In the last short illness her conduct in simple <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> was angelic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I well remember one occasion when my father reproved me for a piece of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessness; and I can still recall the feeling of depression which came over me, and the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> which he took to disperse it by speaking to me soon afterwards with especial kindness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I sometimes <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> that he could do so, with such an undemonstrative race as we are; but I hope he knew how much we delighted in his loving words and manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His doubts were part of his <strong style='color: red'>humility</strong> concerning what was in any way connected with himself; his too favourable view of our work was due to his sympathetic nature, which made him lenient to every one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He kept up towards his children his delightful manner of expressing his thanks; and I never wrote a letter, or read a page aloud to him, without receiving a few kind words of <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These and other such necessaries were always to be found in the study, and it was the only place where this was a <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"His patience and <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> were boundless during this weary illness, and sometimes when most miserable I felt his <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> to be almost too keen.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can recall now how on his return I could hardly bear to have him in the room, the expression of tender <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> and emotion in his face was too agitating, coming fresh upon me after his little absence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"He <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for all our pursuits and interests, and lived our lives with us in a way that very few fathers do.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I am certain that none of us felt that this intimacy interfered the least with our <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> or obedience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever he said was absolute <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and law to us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He always put his whole mind into answering any of our <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One trifling instance makes me feel how he <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for what we <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But yet he knew and remembered the individualities of my many cats, and would talk about the habits and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s of the more remarkable ones years after they had died.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Another <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of his treatment of his children was his <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for their liberty, and for their <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I do not think his exaggerated sense of our good qualities, intellectual or moral, made us conceited, as might perhaps have been expected, but rather more <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> and grateful to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reason being no doubt that the influence of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, of his sincerity and greatness of nature, had a much deeper and more lasting effect than any small exaltation which his praises or admiration may have caused to our vanity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" As head of a household he was much loved and <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed; he always spoke to servants with politeness, using the expression, "would you be so good," in asking for anything.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was hardly ever angry with his servants; it shows how seldom this occurred, that when, as a small boy, I overheard a servant being scolded, and my father speaking angrily, it impressed me as an appalling circumstance, and I remember running up stairs out of a general sense of <strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His good-bye was chiefly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by the pleasant way in which he thanked his guests, as he stood at the door, for having come to see him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His happy choice of matter for talk seemed to flow out of his sympathetic nature, and <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>, vivid interest in other people's work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To some, I think, he caused actual pain by his <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>; I have seen the late Francis Balfour quite discomposed by having knowledge ascribed to himself on a point about which my father claimed to be utterly ignorant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is difficult to seize on the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of my father's conversation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first few words of a sentence would often remind him of some exception to, or some reason against, what he was going to say; and this again brought up some other point, so that the sentence would become a system of parenthesis within parenthesis, and it was often impossible to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the drift of what he was saying until he came to the end of his sentence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin?" "No, sir, because I have time to think before I speak, and don't ask impertinent <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When he felt strongly about any similar <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, he could hardly trust himself to speak, as he then easily became angry, a thing which he disliked excessively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was a great proof of the <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> of his style of talking, that, when, for instance, a number of visitors came over from Sir John Lubbock's for a Sunday afternoon call he never seemed to be preaching or lecturing, although he had so much of the talk to himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some time after he came to live at Down he <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed to found a Friendly Club, and served as treasurer for thirty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to my father's interest in the affairs of the village, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"In all parish matters he was an active <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant; in matters connected with the schools, charities, and other business, his liberal contribution was ever ready, and in the differences which at times occurred in that, as in other parishes, I was always sure of his support.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He held that where there was really no important objection, his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance should be given to the clergyman, who ought to know the circumstances best, and was chiefly responsible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I must say something of his manner of working: one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of it was his <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for time; he never forgot how precious it was.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This was shown, for instance, in the way in which he tried to curtail his holidays; also, and more clearly, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to shorter periods.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I particularly remember noticing this when he was making an experiment on the roots of beans, which required some <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in manipulation; fastening the little bits of card upon the roots was done <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully and necessarily slowly, but the intermediate movements were all quick; taking a fresh bean, seeing that the root was healthy, impaling it on a pin, fixing it on a cork, and seeing that it was vertical, etc; all these processes were performed with a kind of restrained eagerness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although he would patiently go on repeating experiments where there was any good to be gained, he could not endure having to repeat an experiment which ought, if complete <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> had been taken, to have succeeded the first time--and this gave him a continual anxiety that the experiment should not be wasted; he felt the experiment to be sacred, however slight a one it was.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He wished to learn as much as possible from an experiment, so that he did not confine himself to observing the single point to which the experiment was directed, and his power of seeing a number of other things was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think he <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for preliminary or rough observation intended to serve as guides and to be repeated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the literary part of his work he had the same horror of losing time, and the same zeal in what he was doing at the moment, and this made him <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful not to be obliged unnecessarily to read anything a second time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, were lying about on the table, but besides these a number of odds and ends were kept in a round table full of radiating dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs, and turning on a vertical axis, which stood close by his left side, as he sat at his microscope-table.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs were labelled, "best tools," "rough tools," "specimens," "preparations for specimens," etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most marked peculiarity of the contents of these dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs was the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> with which little scraps and almost useless things were preserved; he held the well-known belief, that if you threw a thing away you were sure to want it directly--and so things accumulated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering how tidy and methodical he was in essential things, it is curious that he bore with so many make-shifts: for instance, instead of having a box made of a desired shape, and stained black inside, he would hunt up something like what he wanted and get it darkened inside with shoe-blacking; he did not <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to have glass covers made for tumblers in which he germinated seeds, but used broken bits of irregular shape, with perhaps a narrow angle sticking uselessly out on one side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But so much of his experimenting was of a simple kind, that he had no need for any elaboration, and I think his habit in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> was in great measure due to his desire to husband his strength, and not waste it on inessential things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" His love of each particular experiment, and his eager zeal not to lose the fruit of it, came out markedly in these crossing experiments--in the elaborate <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> he took not to make any confusion in putting capsules into wrong trays, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can recall his appearance as he counted seeds under the simple microscope with an alertness not usually <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ising such mechanical work as counting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of him that he took scrupulous pains in making measurements with his somewhat rough scales.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With this, too, I remember the great <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> he took in getting the fluid-line on to the graduation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few of his mental <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics, bearing especially on his mode of working, occur to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Perseverance seems hardly to express his almost fierce desire to force the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> to reveal itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He often said that it was important that a man should know the right point at which to give up an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this way it naturally happened that many untenable theories occurred to him; but fortunately his richness of <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> was equalled by his power of judging and condemning the thoughts that occurred to him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The intense pleasure he took in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the adaptations for fertilisation is strongly shown in these letters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For books he had no <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, but merely considered them as tools to be worked with.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember, when some alarm of fire had happened, his begging me to be especially <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful, adding very earnestly, that the rest of his life would be miserable if his notes and books were to be destroyed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' I think this <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful arrangement of the plan was not at all essential to the building up of his argument, but for its presentment, and for the arrangement of his facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The arrangement was altered afterwards, because it was too formal and categorical, and seemed to give the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of his grandfather rather by means of a list of qualities than as a complete picture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of him that he felt unable to write with sufficient want of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> if he used his best paper, and thus it was that he wrote on the backs of old proofs or manuscript.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was always so ready to be convinced that any suggested alteration was an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, and so full of gratitude for the trouble taken.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think that he ever used to forget to tell me what <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment he thought that I had made, and he used almost to excuse himself if he did not agree with any correction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think I felt the singular <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong> and graciousness of his nature through thus working for him in a way I never should otherwise have done.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, above all things, direct and clear; and it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of himself in its simplicity, bordering on naivete, and in its absence of pretence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His courteous and conciliatory tone towards his reader is remarkable, and it must be partly this quality which revealed his personal sweetness of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to so many who had never seen him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have always felt it to be a curious fact, that he who had altered the face of Biological Science, and is in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> the chief of the moderns, should have written and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The tone of such a book as the 'Origin' is charming, and almost pathetic; it is the tone of a man who, convinced of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of his own views, hardly expects to convince others; it is just the reverse of the style of a fanatic, who wants to force people to believe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reader is never scorned for any amount of doubt which he may be imagined to feel, and his scepticism is treated with patient <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Though he praised so generously, he always looked closely at the drawing, and easily detected mistakes or <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'" His <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> for other authors was as marked a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic as his tone towards his reader.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He speaks of all other authors as persons deserving of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In other cases he treats the confused writings of ignorant persons as though the fault lay with himself for not appreciating or <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides this general tone of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, he had a pleasant way of expressing his opinion on the value of a quoted work, or his obligation for a piece of private information.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ful feeling was not only morally beautiful, but was I think of practical use in making him ready to consider the ideas and observations of all manner of people.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was a great merit in his mind that, in spite of having so strong a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ful feeling towards what he read, he had the keenest of instincts as to whether a man was trustworthy or not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had a contempt for the love of honour and glory, and in his letters often blames himself for the pleasure he took in the success of his books, as though he were departing from his ideal--a love of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>lessness about fame.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker what he calls a boasting letter, he laughs at himself for his conceit and want of <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully interesting letter which he wrote to my mother bequeathing to her, in case of his death, the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of publishing the manuscript of his first essay on evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Connected with his contempt for the undue love of fame, was an equally strong dislike of all <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s of priority.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether I should so act myself under provocation is a different <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of my father's working life is to be understood, the conditions of ill-health, under which he worked, must be constantly borne in mind.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Herbert relates how, during the same Barmouth summer, he was pressed into the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> of "the science"--as my father called collecting beetles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I performed this <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> with some diligence in my constitutional walks; but alas! my powers of discrimination seldom enabled me to secure a prize--the usual result, on his examining the contents of my bottle, being an exclamation, 'Well, old Cherbury' (No doubt in allusion to the title of Lord Herbert of Cherbury.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" On one occasion Herbert remembers "accompanying him to the afternoon <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> at King's, when we heard a very beautiful anthem.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" His despair over mathematics must have been profound, when he expressed a hope that Fox's silence is due to "your being ten fathoms deep in the Mathematics; and if you are, God <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> you, for so am I, only with this difference, I stick fast in the mud at the bottom, and there I shall remain.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He writes, "We had an earnest conversation about going into Holy Orders; and I remember his asking me, with reference to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> put by the Bishop in the ordination <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, 'Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The index to 'Animals and Plants,' and my father's later correspondence, show how much <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> he received from his old College friend.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He greatly compliments our exertions in Entomology, and says we have taken a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully great number of good insects.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I see a good deal both of Herbert and Whitley, and the more I see of them increases every day the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> I have for their excellent <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ings and <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Romanes points out that my father, "while describing the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of another, is unconsciously giving a most accurate description of his own":-- "I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon became acquainted, through some of my brother entomologists, with Professor Henslow, for all who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for any branch of natural history were equally encouraged by him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I soon became intimate with him, for he had a remarkable power of making the young feel completely at ease with him; though we were all <strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>-struck with the amount of his knowledge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When I reflect how immediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older, and in every way so immensely our superior, I think it was as much owing to the transparent sincerity of his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as to his kindness of heart; and, perhaps, even still more, to a highly remarkable absence in him of all self-consciousness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Once every week he kept open house in the evening, and all who <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for natural history attended these parties, which, by thus favouring inter-communication, did the same good in Cambridge, in a very pleasant manner, as the Scientific Societies do in London.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He never took an ill-natured view of any one's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, though very far from blind to the foibles of others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With all this equability of temper and remarkable benevolence, there was no insipidity of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"Reflecting over his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> with gratitude and <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>, his moral attributes rise, as they should do in the highest <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, in pre-eminence over his intellect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think that I could have venerated him more than I did; but your book has even exalted his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in my eyes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The geological work mentioned in the quotation from my father's pocket-book was doubtless of importance as giving him some practical experience, and perhaps of more importance in <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing to give him some confidence in himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" And again in May: "As for my Canary scheme, it is rash of you to ask <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s; my other friends most sincerely wish me there, I plague them so with talking about tropical scenery, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The following extract from the pocket-book will be a <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> in reading the letters:-- "Returned to Shrewsbury at end of August.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition; he will be treated with every <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Captain Fitz-Roy wants a man (I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>) more as a companion than a mere collector, and would not take any one, however good a naturalist, who was not recommended to him likewise as a GENTLEMAN.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have been lucky hitherto in never losing any person for whom I had any <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> or affection.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was the finest <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> I ever knew.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, upon <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, I think you will excuse me once again, stating my opinions on the offer of the voyage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Disreputable to my <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as a Clergyman hereafter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) My dear Doctor, I feel the responsibility of your application to me on the offer that has been made to Charles as being weighty, but as you have desired Charles to consult me, I cannot refuse to give the result of such <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> as I have been able to [give?] it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I should not think that it would be in any degree disreputable to his <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as a Clergyman.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I cannot conceive that the Admiralty would send out a bad vessel on such a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You are a much better judge of Charles's <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> than I can be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The undertaking would be useless as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s his profession, but looking upon him as a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You will bear in mind that I have had very little time for <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>, and that you and Charles are the persons who must decide.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He is only twenty-three years old, but [has] seen a deal of <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and won the gold medal at Portsmouth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Henslow will give me letters to all travellers in town whom he thinks may <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He says nothing would be so miserable for him as having me with him if I was uncomfortable, as in a small vessel we must be thrown together, and thought it his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to state everything in the worst point of view.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fitz-Roy says the stormy sea is exaggerated; that if I do not choose to remain with them, I can at any time get home to England, so many vessels sail that way, and that during bad weather (probably two months), if I like I shall be left in some healthy, safe and nice country; that I shall always have <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance; that he has many books, all instruments, guns, at my <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>; that the fewer and cheaper clothes I take the better.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have made Captain Beaufort perfectly <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He offers me to mess with him, and he will take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> I have such room as is possible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Chester, who was going as a friend, cannot go, so that I shall have his place in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I will mention just one thing--that on my death-bed, I think I could say I never uttered one insincere (which at the time I did not fully feel) expression about my <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for you.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The only thing that now prevents me finally making up my mind, is the want of <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> about the South Sea Islands; although morally I have no doubt we should go there whether or no it is put in the instructions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not know how to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> you in this case, except by hoping you will give me a trial.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Everybody seems ready to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He was a man of a thoroughly amiable and honourable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and was a valued office-bearer of several of the learned Societies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will give you one proof of Fitz-Roy being a good officer--all the officers are the same as before; two-thirds of his crew and [the] eight marines who went before all offered to come again, so the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> cannot be so very bad.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I never saw so (what I should call, he says not) extravagant a man, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s himself, but as economical towards me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I hope when you next write to Osmaston, [you will] tell them my scheme, and give them my kindest <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s and farewells.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One thing is certain, no vessel has been fitted out so expensively, and with so much <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Recollect, when you write, that I am a sort of protege of yours, and that it is your bounden <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> to lecture me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>She was fitted out for the expedition with all possible <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, being supplied with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully chosen spars and ropes, six boats, and a "dinghy;" lightning conductors, "invented by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His only stowage for clothes being several small dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs in the corner, reaching from deck to deck; the top one being taken out when the hammock was hung up, without which there was not length for it, so then the foot-clews took the place of the top dr<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Captain Fitz-Roy says he will take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> that one corner is so fitted up that I shall be comfortable in it and shall consider it my home, but that also I shall have the run of his.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" My father used to say that it was the absolute necessity of tidiness in the cramped space of the "Beagle" that <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed 'to give him his methodical habits of working.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, taking <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the minutes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The completeness of the equipment was also in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s largely due to the public spirit of Captain Fitz-Roy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides the master and two mates, there was an <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant-surveyor, the present Admiral Lort Stokes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There were also a surgeon, <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant-surgeon, two midshipmen, master's mate, a volunteer (1st class), purser, carpenter, clerk, boatswain, eight marines, thirty-four seamen, and six boys.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You will therefore readily <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how this, combined with the admiration of his energy and ability, led to our giving him the name of 'the dear old Philosopher.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Captain Fitz-Roy was a strict officer, and made himself thoroughly <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed both by officers and men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The occasional severity of his manner was borne with because every one on board knew that his first thought was his <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>, and that he would sacrifice anything to the real welfare of the ship.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Admiral Lort Stokes wrote to the "Times", April 25, 1883:-- "May I beg a corner for my feeble testimony to the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous persevering endurance in the cause of science of that great naturalist, my old and lost friend, Mr.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have given only a few scientific letters, to illustrate the way in which he worked, and how he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed his own results.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In his 'Journal of Researches' he gives incidentally some idea of his personal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; the letters given in the present chapter serve to amplify in fresher and more spontaneous words that impression of his <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> which the 'Journal' has given to so many readers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The time has flown away most delightfully, indeed nothing can be pleasanter; exceedingly busy, and that business both a <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> and a great delight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I find my collections are increasing <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo home.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Captain continues steadily very kind, and does everything in his power to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If he does not kill himself, he will during this voyage do a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful quantity of work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The conviction that I am walking in the New World is even yet <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous in my own eyes, and I dare say it is little less so to you, the receiving a letter from a son of yours in such a quarter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So much for the grand end of my voyage; in other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s things are equally flourishing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But when on shore, and wandering in the sublime forests, surrounded by views more gorgeous than even Claude ever imagined, I enjoy a delight which none but those who have experienced it can <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the contrary, the pleasantest scenes in my life, many of which have been in Cambridge, rise from the contrast of the present, the more vividly in my <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I took several specimens of an Octopus which possessed a most <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous power of changing its colours, equalling any chameleon, and evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nobody could possibly be better fitted in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for collecting than I am; many cooks have not spoiled the broth this time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here I first saw a tropical forest in all its sublime grander--nothing but the reality can give any idea how <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, how magnificent the scene is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Captain does everything in his power to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> me, and we get on very well, but I thank my better fortune he has not made me a renegade to Whig principles.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Tell Professor Sedgwick he does not know how much I am indebted to him for the Welsh Expedition; it has given me an interest in Geology which I would not give up for any <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Bahia the pegmatite and gneiss in beds had the same direction, as observed by Humboldt, prevailing over Columbia, distant 1300 miles--is it not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful? Monte Video will be for a long time my direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Excuse this almost unintelligible letter, and believe me, my dear Henslow, with the warmest feelings of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> and friendship, Yours affectionately, CHAS.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am ashamed of sending such a scrambling letter, but if you were to see the heap of letters on my table you would <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> when we shall ever meet again; but be it when it may, few things will give me greater pleasure than to see you again, and talk over the long time we have passed together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The climate in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s is a curious mixture of severity and mildness; as far as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the animal kingdom, the former <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> prevails; I have in consequence not added much to my collections.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it will be a great advantage having a consort--perhaps it may somewhat shorten our cruise, which I most cordially hope it may.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I trust and believe that the time spent in this voyage, if thrown away for all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, will produce its full worth in Natural History; and it appears to me the doing what LITTLE we can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able an object of life as one can in any likelihood pursue.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is more the result of such reflections (as I have already said) than much immediate pleasure which now makes me continue the voyage, together with the glorious prospect of the future, when passing the Straits of Magellan, we have in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> the world before us.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How many magnificent and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic views, how many and curious tribes of men we shall see! What fine opportunities for geology and for studying the infinite host of living beings! Is not this a prospect to keep up the most flagging spirit? If I was to throw it away, I don't think I should ever rest quiet in my grave.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I never saw any of the diminutive Portuguese, with their murderous countenances, without almost wishing for Brazil to follow the example of Hayti; and, considering the enormous healthy-looking black population, it will be <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful if, at some future day, it does not take place.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some of the Anti-Slavery people ought to <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> about his office; it was the subject of conversation at Rio amongst the lower English.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From some of these hills the scenery, from its savage, solitary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, was most sublime.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is necessary to be separated from all which one has been accustomed to, to know how properly to treasure up such recollections, and at this distance, I may add, how properly to <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> such as yourself, my dear old Herbert.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> when I shall ever see you again.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I hope it may be, as you say, surrounded with heaps of parchment; but then there must be, sooner or later, a dear little lady to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of you and your house.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have seen enough of Slavery and the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>s of the negroes, to be thoroughly disgusted with the lies and nonsense one hears on the subject in England.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) The state of knowledge, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the Cirripedes, was most unsatisfactory at the time that my father began to work at them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It is not <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that he should so have written, it is rather to be <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed at that his spirit withstood so great and constant a strain.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), in which my father's Glen Roy work is criticised, and which is referred to in the following <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic extract from a letter to Sir J.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is provoking and humiliating to find that Chambers not only had not read with any <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> my paper on this subject, or even looked at the coloured map, so that the new shelf described by me had not been searched for, and my arguments and facts of detail not in the least attended to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Your speech was refreshing after it, and was well <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by Fox (my cousin) in three words--'What a contrast!' That struck me as a capital speculation about the Wealden Continent going down.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He not only takes my line of argument from the buttresses and terraces below the lower shelf and some other arguments (without acknowledgment), but he sneers at all his predecessors not having perceived the importance of the short portions of lines intermediate between the chief ones in Glen Roy; whereas I commence the description of them with saying, that 'perceiving their importance, I examined them with scrupulous <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>,' and expatiate at considerable length on them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the terraces at lower levels coincident in height all round Scotland and England, I am inclined to believe he shows some little probability of there being some leading ones coincident, but much more exact evidence is required.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Would you believe it credible? he <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s as a probable solution to account for the rise of Great Britain that in some great ocean one-twentieth of the bottom of the whole aqueous surface of the globe has sunk in (he does not say where he puts it) for a thickness of half a mile, and this he has calculated would make an apparent rise of 130 feet.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He concluded by saying he "came to the same point by an independent course of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, which in a small degree excuses this inadvertency.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" His letter altogether shows a very good <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and says he is "much gratified with the MEASURED approbation which you bestow, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I am heartily glad I was able to say in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that I thought he had done good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in calling more attention to the subject of the terraces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He protests it is unfair to call the sinking of the sea his theory, for that he with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> always speaks of mere change of level, and this is quite true; but the one section in which he shows how he conceives the sea might sink is so astonishing, that I believe it will with others, as with me, more than counterbalance his previous caution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(His contempt for the self-<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing spirit in a naturalist is illustrated by an anecdote, for which I am indebted to Rev.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Botany, I fancy, has not suffered so much as Zoology from mere NAMING; the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, fortunately, are more obscure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His promising <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er was suddenly cut short on September 14, 1853, when, while geologizing in a railway cutting between Retford and Gainsborough, he was run over by a train and instantly killed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I feel sure as long as species-mongers have their vanity tickled by seeing their own names appended to a species, because they miserably described it in two or three lines, we shall have the same VAST amount of bad work as at present, and which is enough to dishearten any man who is willing to work out any branch with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I find every genus of Cirripedia has half-a-dozen names, and not one <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful description of any one species in any one genus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not believe that this would have been the case if each man knew that the memory of his own name depended on his doing his work well, and not upon merely appending a name with a few wretched lines indicating only a few prominent external <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have next to notice your second objection--that retaining the name of the FIRST describer in perpetuum along with that of the species, is a premium on hasty and <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This is quite a different <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> from that of the law of priority itself, and it never occurred to me before, though it seems highly probable that the general <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> of that law may produce such a result.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to adopting my own notions in my Cirripedia book, I should not like to do so without I found others approved, and in some public way,--nor, indeed, is it well adapted, as I can never recognise a species without I have the original specimen, which, fortunately, I have in many cases in the British Museum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the 13th of November, my poor dear father died, and no one who did not know him would believe that a man above eighty-three years old could have retained so tender and affectionate a <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, with all his sagacity unclouded to the last.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Clairvoyance so transcends belief, that one's ordinary faculties are put out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, but in homoeopathy common sense and common observation come into play, and both these must go to the dogs, if the infinitesimal doses have any effect whatever.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" A passage out of an earlier letter to Fox (December, 1884) shows that he was equally sceptical on the subject of mesmerism: "With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to mesmerism, the whole country resounds with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful facts or tales.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I most truly enter into what you say, and quite believe you that you <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> only for the review with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to your father; and that this ALONE would make you like to see extracts from your letters more properly noticed in this same periodical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I feel sure, considering all the circumstances, that without you took pains and wrote WITH CARE, a condensed and finished sketch of some striking feature in your travels, it is better not to send anything.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have not the SMALLEST DOUBT that your facts are of the highest interest with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to glacial action in the Himalaya; but it struck both Lyell and myself that your evidence ought to have been given more distinctly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In your letter you <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> what "Ornamental Poultry" has to do with Barnacles; but do not flatter yourself that I shall not yet live to finish the Barnacles, and then make a fool of myself on the subject of species, under which head ornamental Poultry are very interesting.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I sometimes, after being a whole week employed and having described perhaps only two species, agree mentally with Lord Stanhope, that it is all fiddle faddle; however, the other day I got a curious case of a unisexual, instead of hermaphrodite cirripede, in which the female had the common cirripedial <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and in two valves of her shell had two little pockets, in EACH of which she kept a little husband; I do not know of any other case where a female invariably has two husbands.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The treatment is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully tonic, and I have had more better consecutive days this month than on any previous ones.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have of late been at work at mere species describing, which is much more difficult than I expected, and has much the same sort of interest as a puzzle has; but I confess I often feel wearied with the work, and cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> sometimes asking myself what is the good of spending a week or fortnight in ascertaining that certain just perceptible differences blend together and constitute varieties and not species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have given up my agitation against mihi and nobis; my paper is too long to send to you, so you must see it, if you <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to do so, on your return.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By-the-way, you say in your letter that you <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> more for my species work than for the Barnacles; now this is too bad of you, for I declare your decided approval of my plain Barnacle work over theoretic species work, had very great influence in deciding me to go on with the former, and defer my species paper.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am now at work on the Sessile Cirripedes, and am <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully tired of my job: a man to be a systematic naturalist ought to work at least eight hours per day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is just what I like hearing; believe me that I often think of old days spent with you, and sometimes can hardly believe what a jolly <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less individual one was in those old days.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I can well <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> your reluctance to break up your large and happy party and go abroad; but your life is very valuable, so you ought to be very cautious in good time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I feel sure schools have greatly <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d since our days; but I hate schools and the whole system of breaking through the affections of the family by separating the boys so early in life; but I see no <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>, and dare not run the risk of a youth being exposed to the temptations of the world without having undergone the milder ordeal of a great school.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am at work at the second volume of the Cirripedia, of which creatures I am <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully tired.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The other day I had five grinders (two by the elevator) out at a sitting under this <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful substance, and felt hardly anything.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have been much pleased by finding some odd facts in my first volume believed by Owen and a few others, whose good opinion I <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as final.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If one could insure moderate health for them it would not signify so much, for I cannot but hope, with the enormous emigration, professions will somewhat <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The boys, I think, live too secluded in their separate studies; and I doubt whether they will get so much knowledge of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as boys used to do; and this, in my opinion, is the ONE good of public schools over small schools.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We too lost, as you may remember, not so very long ago, a most dear child, of whom I can hardly yet bear to think tranquilly; yet, as you must know from your own most painful experience, time softens and deadens, in a manner truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, one's feelings and regrets.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My dear Hooker, Amongst my letters received this morning, I opened first one from Colonel Sabine; the contents certainly surprised me very much, but, though the letter was a VERY KIND ONE, somehow, I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d very little indeed for the announcement it contained.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He became Assistant-Secretary to the Horticultural Society, and in 1829 was appointed Professor of Botany at University College, a post which he held for upwards of thirty years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His influence in <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing to introduce the natural system of classification was considerable, and he brought "all the weight of his teaching and all the force of his controversial powers to support it," as against the Linnean system universally taught in the earlier part of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>that the whole red clay and flints over the chalk plateau hereabouts is the residuum from the slow dissolution of the chalk! As <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s ourselves, we have no news, and are all well.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By-the-way, as you <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> so much about North America, I may mention that I had a long letter from a shipmate in Australia, who says the Colony is getting decidedly republican from the influx of Americans, and that all the great and novel schemes for working the gold are planned and executed by these men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You have in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> reason to be proud; consider how few travellers there have been with a profound knowledge of one subject, and who could in addition make a map (which, by-the-way, is one of the most distinct ones I ever looked at, wherefore blessings alight on your head), and study geology and meteorology! I thought I knew you very well, but I had not the least idea that your Travels were your hobby; but I am heartily glad of it, for I feel sure that the time will never come when you and Mrs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Much in a scientific point of view has interested me, especially all about those <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful moraines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even if the meteorology was put in foot-notes, I think it would be an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Well, I am very proud of MY book; but there is one bore, that I do not much like asking people whether they have seen it, and how they like it, for I feel so much identified with it, that such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s become rather personal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I thank you heartily for your letter this morning, and for all the gratification your Dedication has given me; I could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> thinking how much -- would despise you for not having dedicated it to some great man, who would have done you and it some good in the eyes of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again farewell: I have written a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully long letter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You have a right to rest on your oars; or even to say, if it so pleases you, that "your meridian is past;" but well assured do I feel that the day of your reputation and general <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong> has only just begun to dawn.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus, in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (1st edition page 353; 2nd edition page 289), he says: "When finding, as in this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant a part in the great scheme of nature, one is apt to <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> why a distinct species should have been created.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It does not give us a true index of the mass of conjecture which was taking shape in his mind, but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of his belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in the second edition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" "This <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"It is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, dying out about same time in such different quarters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But in the following note we get extinction connected with unfavourable variation, and thus a hint is given of natural selection: "With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to extinction, we can easily see that [a] variety of [the] ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, and thus perish out; or, on the other hand, like Orpheus [a Galapagos bird], being favourable, many might be produced.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The end of the passage is of much interest, as showing that he had at this early date visions of the far-reaching <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the theory of evolution:-- "With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, we are lead to endeavour to discover CAUSES of change; the manner of adaptation (wish of parents??), instinct and structure becomes full of speculation and lines of observation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The following two extracts have a similar interest; the second is especially interesting, as it contains the germ of concluding sentence of the 'Origin of Species': ('Origin of Species' (1st edition), page 490:-- "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful have been, and are being evolved.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844 (still therefore before the second edition of the 'Journal' was completed), we find an enormous <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> made on the note-book of 1837.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is also some further evidence on this side of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wallace; and with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the passage (My father certainly saw the proofs of the paper, for he added a foot-note apologising for the style of the extracts, on the ground that the "work was never intended for publication.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>") in the 'Linnean Journal' it is difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how it should have been allowed to remain as it now stands, conveying, as it clearly does, the impression that 1839 was the date of his earliest written sketch.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here, any close resemblance between the two essays with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to arrangement ceases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>are so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful as to justify the rejection prima facie of our theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The second part seems to have been planned in accordance with his favourite point of view with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to his theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the general style of the Sketch, it is not to be expected that it should have all the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of the 'Origin,' and we do not, in fact, find that balance and control, that concentration and grasp, which are so striking in the work of 1859.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the Autobiography (page 68, volume 1) my father has stated what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he had overlooked "one problem of great importance," the problem of the divergence of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I wish that my sketch be given to some competent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment and enlargement.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I give to him all my books on Natural History, which are either scored or have references at the end to the pages, begging him <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully to look over and consider such passages as actually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to editors, Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The next best (and quite best in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s) would be Professor Henslow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, of Kinnordy, who (being a very old friend of my father and taking a kind interest in my projected <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as a naturalist) had allowed me to peruse them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin's scientific work so many years before that intimacy began which ripened into feelings as near to those of <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> for his life, works, and <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as is reasonable and proper.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"This led to me sending him an outline of the conclusions I had formed <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing the distribution of plants in the southern regions, and the necessity of assuming the destruction of considerable areas of land to account for the relations of the flora of the so-called Antarctic Islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Will you be so good as to present my <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ful compliments to Sir W.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker's work on the Galapagos Flora, my father wrote in 1846: "I cannot tell you how delighted and astonished I am at the results of your examination; how <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully they support my assertion on the differences in the animals of the different islands, about which I have always been fearful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, and with the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the American fossil mammifers, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not know how far you <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> for dry simple geology, but I hope you will let me send you a copy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am going to ask you some MORE <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, though I daresay, without asking them, I shall see answers in your work, when published, which will be quite time enough for my purposes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will trouble you with only one other <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin's own hearty manner, hollow laugh, and thorough enjoyment of home life with friends; strolls with him all together, and interviews with us one by one in his study, to discuss <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s in any branch of biological or physical knowledge that we had followed; and which I at any rate always left with the feeling that I had imparted nothing and carried away more than I could stagger under.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was an established rule that he every day pumped me, as he called it, for half an hour or so after breakfast in his study, when he first brought out a heap of slips with <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s botanical, geographical, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to original creation or production of new forms, I have said that isolation appears the chief element.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to terrestrial productions, a tract of country, which had oftenest within the late geological periods subsided and been converted into islands, and reunited, I should expect to contain most forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I forget my last letter, but it must have been a very silly one, as it seems I gave my notion of the number of species being in great degree governed by the degree to which the area had been often isolated and divided; I must have been cracked to have written it, for I have no evidence, without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then it does follow; but in my most sanguine moments, all I expect, is that I shall be able to show even to sound Naturalists, that there are two sides to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the immutability of species;--that facts can be viewed and grouped under the notion of allied species having descended from common stocks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to books on this subject, I do not know of any systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is veritable rubbish; but there are plenty, as Lyell, Pritchard, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am now reading a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful book for facts on variation--Bronn, 'Geschichte der Natur.</li>

I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and to lose Panagaeus was out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; so that in despair I gently seized one of the Carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust and pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat, and I lost both Carabi and Panagaeus!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>] I can assure you that I perceive how presumptuous it is in me, not a botanist, to make even the most trifling suggestion to such a botanist as yourself; but from what I saw and have heard of you from our dear and kind friend Hooker, I hope and think you will forgive me, and believe me, with much <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, Dear sir, yours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, and for the extremely pleasant and obliging manner in which you have taken my rather troublesome <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The only way in which, I think, you possibly could do it with little trouble would be to bear in mind, whilst correcting your proof-sheets of the Manual, my <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> and put a cross or mark to the species, and whenever sending a parcel to Hooker to let me have such old sheets.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this one <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> I am in the state which, according to a very wise saying of my father's, is the only fit state for asking advice, viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But Heaven knows I am not in this state with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to publishing at all any preliminary essay.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I am delighted that I may say (with absolute <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>) that my essay is published at your suggestion, but I hope it will not need so much apology as I at first thought; for I have resolved to make it nearly as complete as my present materials allow.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact I wrote most frankly; he says he is sure that ultra-<strong style='color: red'>honesty</strong> is my <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic: I do not know whether he meant it as a sneer; I hope not.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Talking of eocene geology, I got so wrath about the Atlantic continent, more especially from a note from Woodward (who has published a capital book on shells), who does not seem to doubt that every island in the Pacific and Atlantic are the remains of continents, submerged within period of existing species, that I fairly exploded, and wrote to Lyell to protest, and summed up all the continents created of late years by Forbes (the head sinner!) YOURSELF, Wollaston, and Woodward, and a pretty nice little extension of land they make altogether! I am fairly rabid on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> and therefore, if not wrong already, am pretty sure to become so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though I must try and cease being rabid and try to feel <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong>, and allow you all to make continents, as easily as a cook does pancakes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now the only way to test this, that I can see, is to consider whether the continents have undergone within this same period such <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful permutations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Submerge our present continents, leaving a few mountain peaks as islands, and what will the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the islands be,--Consider that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are non-volcanic, Etna and Caucasus, volcanic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Helena, may be; but I think we can see some reason why we should have less evidence of sinking than of rising continents (if my view in my Coral volume has any <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> in it, viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to coral reefs, I <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully guarded against its being supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups of atolls.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even after your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would be fair to argue from subsidences in the middle of the greatest oceans to continents; but refreshing my memory by talking with Ramsay in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the probable thickness in one vertical line of the Silurian and carboniferous formation, it seems there must have been AT LEAST 10,000 feet of subsidence during these formations in Europe and North America, and therefore during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic beings.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For these several reasons, and especially considering it certain (in which you will agree) that we are extremely ignorant of means of dispersal, I cannot avoid thinking that Forbes' 'Atlantis,' was an ill-<strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to science, as checking a close study of means of dissemination.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nineteen years (!) ago it occurred to me that whilst otherwise employed on Natural History, I might perhaps do good if I noted any sort of facts bearing on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of the origin of species, and this I have since been doing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You rather mis<strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> me when you think I doubt the POSSIBILITY of subsidence of 20,000 or 30,000 feet; it is only probability, considering such evidence as we have independently of distribution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have not yet worked out in full detail the distribution of mammalia, both IDENTICAL and allied, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the ONE ELEMENT OF DEPTH OF THE SEA; but as far as I have gone, the results are to me surprisingly accordant with my very most troublesome belief in not such great geographical changes as you believe; and in mammalia we certainly know more of MEANS of distribution than in any other class.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What a capital letter of Lyell's that to you is, and what a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful man he is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful case of the Epacridae! It is most vexatious, also humiliating, to me that I cannot follow and subscribe to the way in which you strikingly put your view of the case.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I see from your remarks that you do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> my notions (whether or no worth anything) about modification; I attribute very little to the direct action of climate, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I suppose, in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to specific centres, we are at cross purposes; I should call the kitchen garden in which the red cabbage was produced, or the farm in which Bakewell made the Shorthorn cattle, the specific centre of these SPECIES! And surely this is centralisation enough! I thank you most sincerely for all your <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance; and whether or no my book may be wretched, you have done your best to make it less wretched.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is really IMPOSSIBLE to explain my views (in the compass of a letter), on the causes and means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct and tangible idea,--whether true or false others must judge; for the firmest conviction of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of a doctrine by its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>!.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Nepenthes consisted of ONE or two species in a group with a pitcher developed, then I should have expected it to have been very variable; but I do not consider Nepenthes a case in point, for when a whole genus or group has an organ, however anomalous, I do not expect it to be variable,--it is only when one or few species differ greatly in some one part or organ from the forms CLOSELY ALLIED to it in all other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, that I believe such part or organ to be highly variable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--I do not know how far you will <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to hear, but I find Moquin-Tandon treats in his 'Teratologie' on villosity of plants, and seems to attribute more to dryness than altitude; but seems to think that it must be admitted that mountain plants are villose, and that this villosity is only in part explained by De Candolle's remark that the dwarfed condition of mountain plants would condense the hairs, and so give them the APPEARANCE of being more hairy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My dear Hooker, I am going to enjoy myself by having a prose on my own subjects to you, and this is a greater enjoyment to me than you will readily <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, as I for months together do not open my mouth on Natural History.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My dear Hooker, I honour your conscientious <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> about the medals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is an old notion of mine that more good is done by giving medals to younger men in the early part of their <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er, than as a mere reward to men whose scientific <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er is nearly finished.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether medals ever do any good is a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> which does not concern us, as there the medals are.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[Here follows a group of letters, of various dates, bearing on the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of large genera varying.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My dear Gray, My last letter begged no favour, this one does: but it will really cost you very little trouble to answer to me, and it will be of very GREAT <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to me, owing to a remark made to me by Hooker, which I cannot credit, and which was suggested to him by one of my letters.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I generally believe Hooker implicitly, but he is sometimes, I think, and he confesses it, rather over critical, and his <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> in discovering flaws seems to me admirable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here is my <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>:--"Do you think that good botanists in drawing up a local Flora, whether small or large, or in making a Prodromus like De Candolle's, would almost universally, but unintentionally and unconsciously, tend to record (i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, marking with Greek letters and giving short <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s) varieties in the large or in the small genera? Or would the tendency be to record the varieties about equally in genera of all sizes? Are you yourself conscious on reflection that you have attended to, and recorded more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully the varieties in large or small, or very small genera?" I know what fleeting and trifling things varieties very often are; but my <strong style='color: red'>query</strong> applies to such as have been thought worth marking and recording.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If you could screw time to send me ever so brief an answer to this, pretty soon, it would be a great <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Please observe the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is not whether there are more or fewer varieties in larger or smaller genera, but whether there is a stronger or weaker tendency in the minds of botanists to RECORD such in large or small genera.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Permit me to tell you that, before I had ever corresponded with you, Hooker had shown me several of your letters (not of a private nature), and these gave me the warmest feeling of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to you; and I should indeed be ungrateful if your letters to me, and all I have heard of you, had not strongly enhanced this feeling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I did not feel in the least sure that when you knew whither I was tending, that you might not think me so wild and foolish in my views (God knows, arrived at slowly enough, and I hope conscientiously), that you would think me worth no more notice or <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I could not <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> it, without rewriting all, which would not be fair or worth while, as I have begun on a better abstract for the Linnean Society.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The other day I saw one blown right inland, and then in a few minutes a second one and then a third; and I said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must be in France; and I wrote a letter in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> to you.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a real and great pleasure to me to write to you about my notions; and even if it were not so, I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all the invaluable <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance you have rendered me, if I did not do anything which you asked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little BEFORE the Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher; of this there can be little doubt; the land, on a LARGE SCALE, held much its present <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>: the species were mainly, judging from shells, what they are now.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But now comes a more important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>; there is a considerable body of geological evidence that during the Glacial epoch the whole world was colder; I inferred that, many years ago, from erratic boulder phenomena <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully observed by me on both the east and west coast of South America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) Wherever there was nearly continuous HIGH land, this migration would have been immensely facilitated; hence the European <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the plants of Tierra del Fuego and summits of Cordilleras; hence ditto on Himalaya.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be very liable to be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d or modified by natural selection, to adapt them to the new forms with which they had to compete; hence most of the forms on the mountains of the Tropics are not identical, but REPRESENTATIVE forms of North temperate plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I should beyond anything like to know whether you have any Alpine collections from Japan, and what is their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You cannot imagine what a <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> you have done me in making me make this Abstract; for though I thought I had got all clear, it has clarified my brains very much, by making me weigh the relative importance of the several elements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> is, that I have so accustomed myself, partly from being quizzed by my non-naturalist relations, to expect opposition and even contempt, that I forgot for the moment that you are the one living soul from whom I have constantly received <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Believe [me] that I never forget for even a minute how much <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance I have received from you.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor did I know that you had spoken in general terms about my work to our friends, excepting to dear old Falconer, who some few years ago once told me that I should do more mischief than any ten other naturalists would do good, [and] that I had half spoiled you already!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am at present preparing an Abstract of a larger work on the changes of species; but I treat the subject simply as a naturalist, and not from a general point of view, otherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d on, and might have been quoted by me with great advantage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I remember well that none of your many <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful facts in your several works, perplexed me, for years, more than the migration having been mainly from north to south, and not in the reverse direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I did not for long see the bearing of a conclusion, at which I had arrived, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this subject.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus I explain the fact of so many anomalies, or what may be called "living fossils," inhabiting now only fresh water, having been beaten out, and exterminated in the sea, by more <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d forms; thus all existing Ganoid fishes are fresh water, as [are] Lepidosiren and Ornithorhynchus, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The plants of Europe and Asia, as being the largest territory, I look at as the most "<strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d," and therefore as being able to withstand the less-perfected Australian plants; [whilst] these could not resist the Indian.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have now written 330 folio pages of my abstract, and it will require 150-200 [more]; so that it will make a printed volume of 400 pages, and must be printed separately, which I think will be better in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I always comfort myself with thinking of the future, and in the full belief that the problems which we are just entering on, will some day be solved; and if we just break the ground we shall have done some <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, even if we reap no harvest.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, to show that instincts vary, so that selection could work on and <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I look at my own <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as nearly run out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lastly, I should like particularly to know whether I have taken anything from you, which you would like to retain for first publication; but I think I have chiefly taken from your published works, and, though I have several times, in this chapter and elsewhere, acknowledged your <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance, I am aware that it is not possible for me in the Abstract to do it sufficiently.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--Heaven forgive me, here is another <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>: How far am I right in supposing that with plants, the most important <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s for main divisions are Embryological? The seed itself cannot be considered as such, I suppose, nor the albumens, etc.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But I suppose the Cotyledons and their position, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are embryological, and how far are these very important? I wish to instance plants as a case of high importance of embryological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s in classification.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was nearly all written from memory, and hence I was particularly fearful; it would have been better if the whole had first been <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully written out, and abstracted afterwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>You do me injustice when you think that I work for fame; I value it to a certain extent; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort of instinct to try to make out <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of a searcher after <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> and interpreter of Nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They think of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry, and unswerving <strong style='color: red'>veracity</strong>, who earned his place among the most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of honour; as one who in spite of an acute sensitiveness to praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered upon him; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to listen with patience and <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the most insignificant of reasonable objectors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to that theory of the origin of the forms of life peopling our globe, with which Darwin's name is bound up as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or to crush it by vehemence of denunciation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think any candid or instructed person will deny the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of that which has just been asserted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Either they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, and thus save the <strong style='color: red'>veracity</strong> of the record at the expense of its authority; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain hope of making them confess the creed of Science.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been made (in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> was made) about any similar expressions of opinion a quarter of a century ago.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In fact, the contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the Darwinian <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; between the estimation in which Darwin's views are now held in the scientific world; between the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of the self-<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing order at the present day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new theory <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the origin of species first became known to the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes inclined to think my memories dreams.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have a great <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> for the younger generation myself (they can write our lives, and ravel out all our follies, if they choose to take the trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that the feeling is reciprocal; but I am afraid that the story of our dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that <strong style='color: red'>veneration</strong> for our wisdom which I should like them to display.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I doubt if there was any man then living who had a better right to expect that anything he might choose to say on such a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as the Origin of Species would be listened to with profound attention, and discussed with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>; and there was certainly no man whose personal <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> should have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>), is so striking an exemplification of his singular gentleness and <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>, that it rather increases one's indignation against the presumption of his critic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Some inkling of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology, and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the proviso that he cannot "consent to test the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of Natural Science by the word of Revelation;" but, for all that, he devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin with a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> which forms a grateful contrast to the tone of some of the preceding writers, but consents to go with him only a very little way.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" "With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to simple varieties and closely allied species, I believe that Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Darwin's theory may explain many things, and throw a great light upon numerous <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) On the other hand, Lyell, up to that time a pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have looked at Dian, after the Endymion affair), declared himself a Darwinian, though not without putting in a serious caveat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous stand for <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> as against consistency, did him infinite honour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would indicate a lack of sense, as well as of <strong style='color: red'>modesty</strong>, to ascribe to the men of that generation less capacity or less <strong style='color: red'>honesty</strong> than their successors possess.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What, then, are the causes which led instructed and fair-judging men of that day to arrive at a judgment so different from that which seems just and fair to those who follow them? That is really one of the most interesting of all <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s connected with the history of science, and I shall try to answer it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I think I must have read the 'Vestiges' before I left England in 1846; but, if I did, the book made very little impression upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with the 'Species' <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> until after 1850.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At that time, I had long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been impressed upon my childish <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing as Divine <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from which it had cost me many a struggle to get free.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But my mind was unbiassed in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> of any doctrine which presented itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and scientific reasoning.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I confine myself to what must be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a modest and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the existing species of animals and plants did originate in that way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears to me to be highly improbable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Grant, of University College, who had a word to say for Evolution--and his advocacy was not calculated to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Outside these ranks, the only person known to me whose knowledge and capacity compelled <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, and who was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and secondly, that no suggestion <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and I had read the 'Vestiges' with due <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>; but neither of them afforded me any good ground for changing my negative and critical attitude.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the 'Philosophie Zoologique,' it is no reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809, was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a century later.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not think that any <strong style='color: red'>impartial</strong> judge who reads the 'Philosophie Zoologique' now, and who afterwards takes up Lyell's trenchant and effectual criticism (published as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science generally,--buccinator tantum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the advocates of his claims have failed to show that he, in any <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, anticipated the central idea of the 'Origin of Species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) If one reads any of the earlier editions of the 'Principles' <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully (especially by the light of the interesting series of letters recently published by Sir Charles Lyell's biographer), it is easy to see that, with all his energetic opposition to Lamarck, on the one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of Agassiz, on the other, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly disposed to account for the origination of all past and present species of living things by natural causes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Again, the following remarkable passage occurs in the postscript of a letter addressed to Sir John Herschel in 1836:-- "In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the origination of new species, I am very glad to find that you think it probable that it may be carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, page 5):-- "In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to this last subject [the changes from one set of animal and vegetable species to another].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I remember that it was the conclusion he [Lamarck] came to about man that fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which his arguments at first made on my mind, all the greater because Constant Prevost, a pupil of Cuvier's forty years ago, told me his conviction 'that Cuvier thought species not real, but that science could not <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> without assuming that they were so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'" See the same sentiment in the letter to Darwin, March 11, 1863, page 363:-- "I think the old 'creation' is almost as much required as ever, but of course it takes a new form if Lamarck's views <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d by yours are adopted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fact is, that a discerning eye might have seen that some form or other of the doctrine of transmutation was inevitable, from the time when the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> enunciated by William Smith that successive strata are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ised by different kinds of fossil remains, became a firmly established law of nature.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And if any one had plied him with the four <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s which he puts to Lyell in the passage already cited, all that can be said now is that he would certainly have rejected the first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither did it <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> me to be told by an eminent anatomist that species had succeeded one another in time, in virtue of "a continuously operative creational law.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was not aware, at that time, that he had then been many years brooding over the species-<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle answer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled me.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it would seem that four or five years' hard work had enabled me to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> what it meant; for Lyell ('Life and Letters,' volume ii.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Hooker, he was already, like Voltaire's Habbakuk, "capable du tout" in the way of advocating Evolution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That which we were looking for, and could not find, was a hypothesis <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the origin of known organic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, it did the immense <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> of freeing us for ever from the dilemma--refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and what have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner? In 1857, I had no answer ready, and I do not think that any one else had.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A year later, we reproached ourselves with dullness for being perplexed by such an <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But, with any and every critical doubt which my sceptical <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> could suggest, the Darwinian hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The only rational course for those who had no other object than the attainment of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, was to accept "Darwinism" as a working hypothesis, and see what could be made of it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the particular theory put forth by Darwin, I venture to affirm that, so far as my knowledge goes, all the <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> and all the learning of hostile critics have not enabled them to adduce a solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with the Darwinian theory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there are two or three objections of a more general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which, though they have been answered over and over again, crop up now and then to the present day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not a little <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that such an accusation as this should be brought against a writer who has, over and over again, warned his readers that when he uses the word "spontaneous," he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of that which is so termed; and whose whole theory crumbles to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation for illimitable past ages is denied.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But probably the best answer to those who talk of Darwinism meaning the reign of "chance," is to ask them what they themselves <strong style='c
