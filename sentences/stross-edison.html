<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The heroic biography we were fed as schoolchildren does have its limitations, beginning with the omission of other inven tors who played critical roles-not just Edison's gifted <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants, but also his accomplished competitors.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why would the phono graph, of all things, have made its inventor famous beyond imagining? More mysterious is that it was not the phonograph itself-it would take two decades before the machine was ready to be actually commer cialized on a mass scale-but the mere idea of the phonograph that in- INTRODUCTION \3 stantly seized the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> of everyone who heard of it, inspiring es sayists to expect machines capable of thinking as well as speaking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two years before Edison was born, his Canadian father, Samuel, an innkeeper by trade and Thomas Paine-like firebrand by <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>, backed an insurrec tion against the Canadian provincial government.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His father introduced his son to the highly <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed writings of Paine, but young Edison did not inherit his father's interest in politics.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As for Edison, the superinten dent threatened to send him off to prison for his criminal negligence while on <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Within the club, two talents were prized most highly: technical skill INTRODUCTION \ 7 when operating the apparatus and <strong style='color: red'>creativity</strong> when devising practical jokes for the unaware.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison was highly <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by his peers on both counts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When he finished his trial test-easily-and reached the boardinghouse where he would stay with fellow operators he knew from earlier, the first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> he had for them was this: Would their boss permit him to tinker during his free time? The answer was yes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Three individuals quickly stepped forward to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him work on various projects, such as <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d telegraph transmit ters, a stock-price printer, a fire alarm that used telegraph technology, and an electric vote recorder for Congress and state legislatures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anyone who <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed them gain an edge was paid a premium, and a bright telegraphy expert like twenty-two-year-old Edison could make a nice living inventing and manufacturing <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d equipment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Judging by the accounts of his contemporaries, at the time he set off on his own in 1869 he was not just <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ed but also well liked, so much so that he could work harder than everyone else without antago nizing his peers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Trust was not un related to Edison's temperance, a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic rare in that circle.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His early <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er was fueled by something other than resentments, which he lacked.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor did he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> his partial deafness as an impediment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The insulation would also 10/ INTRODUCTION prove <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful when he became famous, partially protecting him from the unceasing demands from strangers for conversation and speeches.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the power of the press to shape the life story of the celebrity, to create (and destroy, should it wish to do so).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He directed <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants to maintain newspaper clippings about him, a practice that he would main tain his entire life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He did <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, at least most of the time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison's need for autonomy was primal and unvarying; it would de termine the course of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er from beginning to end.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For a few restless years, until he would have the where withal to shake free of partners, at least active ones who impinged upon his day-to-day activities, Edison hopped from one business venture and short-lived <strong style='color: red'>partnership</strong> to another, moving from Boston to New York City, then to a succession of cities in New Jersey, ending up in Newark.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it would 13 14 / be wrong to infer a hunger on his part for wide public <strong style='color: red'>recognition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Financial prospects for Edison's <strong style='color: red'>partnership</strong>s brightened and darkened and brightened again month to month, wholly typical of small firms with a highly specialized product and re stricted customer base.</li>

The language may strike modern ears as sinister-What do you think ofme, little girl?-but its <strong style='color: red'>veracity</strong> is bolstered by a strikingly similar ac count in the Christian Herald & Signs of Our Times.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A system to automate telegraphy would provide a fundamental <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>, and this, too, Edison worked on.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is likely that he, like his chief <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, Charles Batchelor, envisaged no ongoing role other than receiving royalty checks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The man was only thirty years old, but he carried an aura of authority and a tendency toward curtness that suggested <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This approach took advantage of the fact that a tuning fork will respond to the vibrations of another fork with identical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics and ignore others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was while Alexander Graham Bell and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant were experi menting with acoustic telegraphy that Bell accidentally, and famously, discovered that the instruments could convey any form of sound.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After Bell's success, the next best thing for Edison was to come up with an indispensable <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, the carbon transmitter that captured the human voice far better than Bell's magnetic design.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(Johnson's excitability, on occasion, led to misplaced enthusiasm, such as his eagerness in April 1876 to persuade Edison to lend his name to Johnson's invention of an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d tobacco pipe that Johnson hoped to market as "Edison's Perpetual Segar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>About the time of Bell's concert-lecture in New York City, Edison and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants were still working out the kinks while giving concerts in nearby Newark.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In what readers of 1877 were expected to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> as a humorous touch, the reporter concluded that were Edison to succeed in devising a telephone for speaking, "what an instrument of torture it would be in the hands and at the mouth of a distant and irate mother-in-law.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The process that produced the invention could not be called <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> ful planning, but it was something more than pure serendipity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Initially, telephones were <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as instruments to be used only by telegraph company employees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A sketch and brief caption in a notebook entry dated 17 July 1877 recorded an idea for putting the paper to use on the telephone problem: Edison and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants sketched in bare outline a system that the tele graph company could use to record spoken messages.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When Edison was working long hours, which on occasion meant all-night work sessions, his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants were expected to do the same.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The entries for 18 July 1877 were extensive but focused on the tele phone; only at the bottom of one page was the following brief entry: Just tried experiment with a diaphragm [sic] having an emboss ing point & held against parafin [sic] paper moving rapidly the spkg vibrations are indented nicely & theres [sic] no doubt that I shall be able to store up & reproduce automatically at any future time the human voice perfectly Though Edison used the first-person voice, Batchelor and James Adams, another <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, signed their names to the page, too.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" We can assume that Batchelor's assignments were tightly coupled with Edison's own experimental agenda of the mo ment, and the task that occupied the entire staff was to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong> the tele- \31 phone's ability to handle human speech rather than music.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In October 1877, he wrote his father that he was "at present very hard up for cash," but if his "speaking telegraph" was successful, he would receive an <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> on royalties.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Butler thought this so remarkable that "I do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Scientific American's <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ful treatment of this path to failure was not exasperating enough to Johnson, the magazine had also voiced the pre diction that it would lead someday to the recording of speech that could be transmitted electrically by wire.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Such was the authority of Scientific American's imprimatur that all of this extraordinary attention was lavished not on the first working phonograph made available for public inspection, but merely on a description supplied by Edison's <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But one immediate benefit of the press's <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ing was that the extensive coverage supplied Edison with creative ideas about how the phonograph could be adapted for many more uses than telegraphy or senatorial speeches.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> but feel a little <strong style='color: red'>sympathy</strong> for Bell in the competition between the two men.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The acclaim for his telephone was quickly super seded by the attention that Edison's <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments drew, and then by Edison's phonograph.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER TWO JANUARy-ApRIL 1878 ASA BUSINESSPERSON poised to bring the phonograph to mar ket, Thomas Edison was hindered as much as <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed by expe rience.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The investors feared that Edison would exhaust the $10,000 <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> before the phonograph would be ready for the market.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison would not approve, feeling (correctly) that, as one of the investors wrote another, the proposed change "was a reflection upon his ability to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of himself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" According to a psychological profile published at the time in the Phrenological Journal, his backers had to be flexible and patient, as Edison was apt to "show irritability and people who do not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> him may think he is impatient and fretful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The journal expressed con cern that if Edison did not take proper <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of himself, "he will become exhausted and break down.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Improving the phonograph's sound <strong style='color: red'>clarity</strong>, natural intonation, and volume of reproduced speech were Edison's principal concerns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison speculated, "They do not expect or imagine that a machine can talk hence cannot <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it]s] words.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Local promoters were so pleased to receive Johnson and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant that they agreed to his demand of a guaran teed flat fee of $100 rather than accept a percentage of the gate receipts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the early 1870s, when Edison was working under contract on the quadruplex telegraph with a group of <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants, the work had established the proof of concept, but the prototype was not wholly reliable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Below the comparatively restrained headline "A Marvelous Discov ery" was a subheadline that nicely summarized the theme of the profile: "A Man of Thirty One Revolutionizing the Whole World.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison interrupted his work at Menlo Park, answered his <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, and then resumed what he had been doing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If any person in Menlo Park was in a good position to provide what we today would call a con sumer perspective to <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> plan the introduction of the phonograph to the marketplace, it would have been the person who stood clear of the self-absorbed laboratory: Mrs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the very shortest time after they were married, Edison had viewed his wife as his <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>meet in the lab.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For members of the general public, the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d edge of applied sci ence was not easily distinguishable from Broadway magic, creating the opportunity for someone like John Worrell Keely, an inventor-a title open to anyone-and a fraud.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the beginning of Keely's rise to fame, Edison had been intrigued and had visited Keely's workshop to ask some prelimi nary <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, intending to return with Batchelor for a round-the clock vigil to watch the Keely engine in action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For a brief moment, Edison's claims were treated in some scientific quarters <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>fully, even in the Scientific American.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It sat close enough to the city to be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed proprietarily by New York-based reporters as their own.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A great public <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and a great business opportunity, too.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Cummings meekly took it all in, un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ingly, and was so eager to depict Edison as a genius that he reported as fact details that were empirical impossibilities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When Cummings, the polite guest, asked Edison how he had discov ered the phonograph, Edison concocted a great drama in the wrong place, not when he and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants had first tried to record on a strip of paper, but later, when he directed his chief machinist to build the first cylinder model, the successful testing of which was noted in the lab books with scarcely a yawn.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" When letters came pouring in, imploring him to commercialize the invention, he announced that he had assigned two of his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants to work on tests, and was confident he would have a hearing aid on the market within months.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The aerophone made for <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful copy, but reporters found it impos sible to see it for themselves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In early March, he hired a few more hands, but that gave him a total of ten or twelve <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants, eight of whom were working on the phonograph, and the others on the tele phone.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the same time that Edison was working on a new version of the phonograph that employed a disc rather than foil wrapped around a cylinder, he was also serving as host to increasing numbers of reporters and visitors, performing the same parlor games, answering the same repetitive <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Cheever had <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed whip up the public's interest by holding public exhibitions in New York City, packing in three hundred people each afternoon, and drawing in the influential figures who were concentrated in Manhattan.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why not announce that sales agents must place their or ders-and pay in full-in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>? Figuring that each unit would only cost $15 to manufacture and would sell for $100, Hubbard gleefully rubbed his hands together, calculating paper profits.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cheever was more concerned that early customers remain happy customers, and <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed aloud whether it would be better to lease the first small phonographs, once they were ready for release, rather than selling them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>\S3 The principals of the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company de bated various business models, and counted in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the coming profits, without asking Edison's opinion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The phonograph, described in close detail in the Sun's long profile "A Marvelous Discovery," which had started the stampede to Menlo Park, was <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed by many as fantastic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Truth appeared to be spoof; and spoof, <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Ten days after his spoof appeared, Croffut published a serious profile of Edison that differed from the New York Sun's only in its <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong> in finding new ways to extol Edison's genius.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was Croffut who coined the new nickname "the Wizard of Menlo Park" (an <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment on Croffut's previous attempt at coining a new name for Edison: "the Jer sey Columbus").</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Could he <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> them? He sent her a check for $5.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Coburn followed the next month with a renewed plea for <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison received a plea for financial <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance from an official in a position of power over his professional future: Zenas Wilber, who was the Patent Office's chief examiner of electrical apparatus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But just then, when the whole world seemed to be focused on him and his me chanical <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>, Edison simply could not muster the focus to complete its development.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Without <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, he was distracted by the attention that came with celebrity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison himself, however, never indicated he gave thought to, let alone desired, subsidy, nor did he see his work as a noble enterprise in <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to humanity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On a not atypical day, a group of thirty businesspeople, inhibitions loosened by a "bucket of punch" they had brought along, took possession of the labo ratory, leaving Edison no recourse but to disappear, <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing what he was going to do when a party of one hundred more visitors, on their way down from Boston, arrived.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appeared to be a sincere testimonial, written by a new celebrity who also was able to work in mention of coming <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments to his phonograph that "will soon justify all the hopes of its friends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Croffut, on his part, acted less as a reporter than as Edison's unoffi cial amanuensis, recording whatever Edison claimed without indepen dently sorting through Edison's pronouncements to distinguish <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> from wishful thinking.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Croffut was silent, either because he was completely credulous, or perhaps because he knew of this problem but calculated his own <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er was best served by preserv ing the mythic image he was working so hard to create.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the Roman Empire was at its height the table was a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> of diversity-they fed on nightingales' tongues, and all sorts of dainty dishes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(When the priest touched his arm to let him know it was time to go, Edison misinterpreted the gesture, thinking it was a rebuke for not showing proper <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong>, and stooped down almost to his knees, re maining with bowed head.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No one knew how to clear up the misunder standing with the <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> still in progress.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For him, the highlight of the day appears to have been at the end when he and Batchelor, after saying their good-byes, raced each other down the hill, oblivious to the rain and the propriety expected of the eminent inventor and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This scene, painted by a stranger with a ripe <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>, was based on nothing at all.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison's almost total withdrawal from the family's domestic sphere was the leitmotif that 66 / would be the one Edison and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants chose for Edison's life narra tive: the tireless inventor.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison agreed, making plans to stay three weeks in Au gust and offer a demonstration of what Vincent poetically described as "all the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>s of electricity which you can evoke and exhibit.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He informed Edison he was going to write an article about the machine, calling it by what he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed to be its proper name, and expressed the hope that Edison would correct his patent records accordingly.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Scientific American, which had taken the lead in introducing the world to the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s of the phonograph, con tinued to do so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Meanwhile, Edison had left the phonograph with the rest of his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s \71 back in Menlo Park.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was determined to see all that could possibly be seen on his trip, and he secured the very best position to do so, obtain ing permission to ride at the very front, on top of the locomotive's cow catcher, with the <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> of a letter from Jay Gould, with whom he had developed a relationship years earlier when Gould had used his railroad interests to gain control of Western Union and Edison was the tele graphic equipment expert of the day.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison's party arrived well in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of the eclipse, but after the solar event Edison took a dilatory four weeks to return home.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison kept in touch with his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants at the laboratory, but the only time he heard news about his pregnant wife was when his secretary, Stockton Griffin, wrote him on August 5 with a report that she was not well.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He and Barker had just finished a three-day visit to San Francisco; ahead was a tour of Yosemite; a visit to mines in Virginia City, Nevada; hunting and fishing in Wyoming; and then the appearance at the Amer ican Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in St.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A perceptive newspaper reporter noticed upon Edison's return to Menlo Park that blurring of boundary separating the private and the public that we now <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> as accompanying the arrival of celebrity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"The people have come to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> him as public property, and were almost jealous of the little time he found to give his family," said the New York Sun.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Automatic regulating mechanisms that eliminated the need for maintenance men to make the rounds were tried, but their complexity and un<strong style='color: red'>reliability</strong> introduced new problems.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In 1878, at least twenty different individuals had tried to make a practical incandescent bulb, or were still engaged in the quest, and no one had succeeded in producing a bulb that was ready for <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> outside of a laboratory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison was accompanied by Barker; another professor, Charles Chandler, of Columbia University; and Edison's chief <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, Charles Batchelor.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This required a fertile <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison thought he saw the perfect opportunity: others had solved the problem of power, and he would add a solution for providing a reliable bulb, which he told the press soon after was "so simple that a bootblack might <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison was not necessarily more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less about making empty claims than his contem porary inventors in the electric light field; he simply was more exposed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>\SI "I don't <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> so much about making my fortune," Edison said in an in terview, "as I do for getting ahead of the other fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"I have it now!" he claimed, though he was unwilling to provide specifics, other than to say that "scientific men" had not thought to in vestigate his approach and "everybody will <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> why they have never thought of it, it is so simple.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Gouraud sent Edison a continuous flow of reports from Europe that would have stimulated the <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> of any inventor, even one with out a weakness for the grandiose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was making daily <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments, he claimed, and it would even tually take its place "in the niche of public utility in good time.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Financial <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s played a part in allocation of time and re sources, too.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Commissions from the phonograph that brought in hun dreds of dollars were hardly worth accounting for, not when William Vanderbilt and his friends were about to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> Edison $50,000 for the electric light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison wrote a correspondent that he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed the fi nancier's interest especially satisfying as Vanderbilt was "the largest gas stock owner in America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle printed an editorial titled "Revenge Is Sweet" in which it observed that the general public greatly enjoyed the discomfort of the gas companies, too: "To see them squirm and writhe is a public satisfaction that lifts Edison to a higher plane than that of the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful inventor and causes him to be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a benefactor of the human race, the leading deity of popular idolatry.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One independent observer, Albert Salomon von Rothschild, in Vi enna, had had his interest piqued, and he wrote an American colleague for an <strong style='color: red'>impartial</strong> assessment of whether Edison's invention would "allow electric light to be henceforth employed everywhere just as gas-light, and not only in very large rooms or places, as is now the case [with arc lights].</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The prospective investors apparently had been told little about Edison's setbacks in his electric light research, and Edison <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ably was not eager to make a public display of his yet-to-be-reversed failure in the laboratory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Batchelor said he and the other <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants had prevailed upon him to keep the curious out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the same time that Edison was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful not to let outsiders see the true state of his electric light research, he continued to accept cheerfully individual requests for interviews from the major newspapers.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This was the only way to do justice to his subject, did not Edison agree, "my <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed manipulator of the fiery lightning"? Fox's flattery is not especially noteworthy; not just Edison, but his wife and children, too, received uncommon compli ments on a daily basis.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On 15 No vember, the newly formed Edison Electric Light Company gave Edison an <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> royalty payment of $30,000, of which $25,000 was to go \91 for work at the laboratory for "further necessary investigations and ex periments" related to the light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few days later, some members of the company's executive commit tee paid a visit to Menlo Park, and Lowrey did his best to convince Edi son that such visits were <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful in making their expectations of progress more realistic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When other company directors made another visit, Lowrey again labored to convince Edison that it was good that the backers had had "their <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>s somewhat tempered.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The thank-you note that Fox sent to Edison treated the gift as recogni tion of past <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s rendered (it made Fox "truly sensible of the pleas ing fact that my friendship is not unappreciated"), but he, too, served up fulsome flattery, closing with the wish that Edison continue in his "triumphal march to undying fame.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison had no patience for attending personally to the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and feeding of his back ers; that was for minions like Griffin or his attorney, Grosvenor Lowrey, to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The investors did stand by the inventor, which was important to young Francis Upton, who, like any new hire at a start-up that was in trouble, spent much time <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing if he had made a mistake.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At times like early March 1879, when Upton wrote his family <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>ing that he was actually paid $12 a week for labor that "does not seem like work but like study and I enjoy it," he seemed younger than his twenty six years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In early June 1879, Edison offered to provide his young <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant a 5 percent share of equity in the Edison Electric Light Company.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison could not trumpet the promising results in public because he had maintained all along that the necessary technical <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong> had been accomplished in short order at the beginning of the initiative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Francis Upton had already learned, however, that Edison used "perfect" as verb or ad jective without <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> for conventional definitions, and it was best not GETTING AHEAO\97 to be carried along by his optimism.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" What Edison recalled about the visit in the interviews late in his life that serve as his memoirs was Bern hardt's interest in everything she saw; her long dress that one of Edi son's <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants was assigned to watch <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully so that it was not caught in a machine; and the cumbersome process of translating everything from English into French.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Two years before Bernhardt's visit, Edison had begun his own <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er in stage business, when he had brought a single prop-his new phono graph-to the offices of Scientific American.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Fox accepted the arrangement and worked on the story; Upton <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ed with revisions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For Edison, receiving such highly visible support was <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful to the cause, but the timing was hardly ideal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The number of people crowding into the limited space made work impos sible; the laboratory <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants found themselves fully occupied answer ing <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s, and trying to protect the equipment from damage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Across the room a lab <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant manually flicked one light on and off rapidly, as many times, it was claimed, as a household would switch a light on and off over the course of thirty years, and on it burned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Where the realm of science ended and that of entertainment began could no longer be distinguished, judging by the printed condemnation of the behavior of a minority of the visitors who "<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d nothing for sci ence, who <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed the laboratory as they would a circus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" In the laboratory itself, the lights were arranged on a table to resemble a miniature layout of Menlo Park, and Edison had assigned <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants on all four sides to look out for sabotage.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But distin guished visitors would show up, insisting that they see the great man himself, and he would have to appear, answer the same <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s that he had already addressed countless times before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Without the rollout of commercial <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in New York or another city, the show ended without disarming the skeptics who said that Edison's lighting system had yet to be tested outside of his cozy laboratory and own home.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If he continues to observe the same strict economy of practical results which has hitherto <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized his efforts in electric lighting, there is no reason why he should not for the next 20 years com pletely solve the problem of the electric light twice a year with out in any way interfering with its interest or novelty.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This created the need for "bamboo hunters" to search out the varieties with <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics most suitable for the purpose.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison placed the blame on the victim him self, writing a mutual friend that he had cautioned Segredor "about his diet and about drinking cold drinks but as you say he was very self willed and would always do in these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s about as he pleased and this I doubt not caused his death.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even at the time, there was considerable head-scratching among Edison's colleagues about how Edison could have permitted the project to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> so far without anyone testing the circuits as work proceeded.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison must have been upset, too, by the way that George Barker, his friend at the University of Pennsylvania, seemed to have switched allegiance, writing him that Maxim's bulbs were brighter than Edison's, an observation that Barker felt he had to share with Edison because "my own self-<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> requires me to be honest, even with a friend, like yourself.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In making arrangements with the city to lay wires for his <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, Edi son had not pursued a contract for street lighting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He knew his bulb was ill suited for the purpose, and even were that not the case, he ex pected to be fully occupied initially with supplying individual busi nesses with <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the morning, he would arise, have a good breakfast, and exclaim, "What a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful night's work I have done.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This was daring-everyone present knew well that it was not far from the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The situation seemed so hopeless that Edison, the irrepressible optimist, was <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing aloud that night what 168 / would happen to them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Insull began with two hundred employees in Schenectady and immedi ately obtained <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d results, building up an electrical supply business that was not dependent upon the sale of turnkey systems.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Insull wrote that in the future whenever he asked Tate about a particular matter "what I want you to do in these days of cheap telegraphic rates is to leave nothing to my <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>" when replying.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The more the shops prospered, the more boldly Edison, through Tate, siphoned off the profits by overcharging the Schenectady factory for lab <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison sales agents in the field felt <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less as they lost municipal contracts again and again in competitive bids against rivals like Westinghouse, which offered an alternating current system, and Thomson - Houston, which offered customers a choice of alternating or direct current systems.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Eulogized as a "<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful man" who had been a longtime employee, the victim also happened to be engaged to be mar ried.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" An alert person could avoid being run over by a <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>less driver, but "no amount of agility will be of any avail to him when a deadly arc-light current is conveyed without a note of warning into his anatomy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When Edison first introduced electric light <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> in New York City, his primary competition at the time had been the gas utilities, so he had done his best to call public attention to the dangers of gas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The state's <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> of adopting electrocution for executions gave him an opportunity to point to the inherently dangerous nature of the competition's technology.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Cooperation between rivals was another possibility, one that oc curred to George Westinghouse.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He, for his part, was most appreciative of the hospitality that Edison had shown him when Westinghouse had paid a visit to Menlo Park, shopping for a power plant for his own house before he had entered the business himself and even before Edison Electric had formally launched its own <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Westinghouse's invitation had arrived just as Edison was directing lab experiments whose purpose was to undermine Westinghouse's reputa tion, namely, how much electrical current was needed to execute a human being? Stray dogs were used as surrogates at the lab, which offered to 176 / boys in Orange a bounty of twenty-five cents for each hapless dog deliv ered to its gates for the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment of science (and intercompany com petition).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This impressed the lab assis tants, who took <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> to wear rubber gloves even when writing in the lab's notebook, Edison said "with a grin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Anticipating that mention of capital punishment was unlikely to elicit the desired <strong style='color: red'>cooperation</strong> of the SPCA, Edison blandly explained that he was looking into determin ing the exact quantity of electricity required to kill dogs, work that would incidentally <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to safeguard the lives of linemen in the electric power business.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Would the SPCA be so kind as to supply some "good sized" animals as soon as possible? Henry Bergh, the society's president, could not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison, whom he <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a "genius" who had "conferred such great and lasting benefits upon humanity," could have so misunder stood the mission of the SPCA.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The dogs placed in Edison's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> would be subjects in experiments that entailed suffering, not instantaneous death.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such was his celebrity and presumed expertise that no one pointed out that it was strange that Edison was experimenting with small mam mals months after he had spoken with such <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> about the effects of electrical currents upon humans.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The judge who heard the appeal <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ably blanched at uphold ing the constitutionality of the new law without assurance from the sci entific community about the humaneness of electrocution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The United States Illuminating Company ran wires elsewhere on the street, but though it was reasonable to assume that one of its wires was improperly insulated, the fatal current could not be traced with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> to a particular point of contact.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Without <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, moving all power lines to underground conduits, as in Edi son's system, would eliminate the danger in running them overhead amid tangles with others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This, in turn, left his competitors <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing why he had cast off the restraint expected in civilized com petition.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At that point, he was fully justified in believing that he had the ear of the world and could make everyone <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the superiority of his system of power and light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Westinghouse also dredged up an old interview with Edison and found this quotation: "I don't <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> so much for a fortune as I do for get ting ahead of the other fellows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" American consumers ignored the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of whether alternating current was truly "safe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This was the signal for the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant to throw the lever.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The witnesses were so aghast, the sight of blood drops that appeared on Kemmler's forehead so horrifying, the stench of singed hair so strong, that no one present could later say with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> how long the second attempt at execution lasted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" "Far Worse Than Hanging" read the headline in the New York Times, which <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized Kemmler's execution as nothing less than "a dis grace to civilization.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The organization chart, however, reflected a different <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing among the principals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This was not close to the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, and is especially amusing when placed in juxtapo sition to Alfred Tate's account of the moment when Tate, hearing news of the merger first, had been the one to convey the news to Edison.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison found himself staring from the outside looking in, as others who had the business <strong style='color: red'>acumen</strong> to extend electric light with newer tech nology, unconstrained by the orthodoxies written by a direct-current zealot, capitalized on the opportunity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was weighed down with self-doubt, telling an <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant that he had come to the realization that others on his staff knew more about electricity than he did.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Convincing Mina to move up to the mine, along with the children and the servants, was out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Edison's letters to Mina reveal an aspect of his <strong style='color: red'>personality</strong> that would not otherwise have been visible: his personal philosophy concerning mental well-being.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In August 1895, when Mina and the children were at Chau tauqua, and he was at Ogden, he responded to Mina's expression of the "blues" with <strong style='color: red'>empathy</strong>, and tried as many therapeutic approaches as his philosophy permitted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He teased her in a way that would make a mental-health professional today cringe (re ferring to her in a babyish third-person voice: "I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> if Billy Edison truly loves me or does she just say so at times to keep me deceived.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His chief <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, Walter Mallory, was "the most dejected man you ever saw," Edison wrote Mina, but "your lover [is] as bright and cheerful as a bumble bee in flower time.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For a while it would become a viable business, which Mallory headed, but not an <strong style='color: red'>innovation</strong> in the same class as electric light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison reassigned one of his principal <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants 196 / at the mine, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, whom Edison knew was also a talented photographer, to head up work on the kinetoscope.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was Dickson who would <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the project with myriad contribu tions-and continue to do so after he parted with Edison on less-than amicable terms in 1895 and put his talents and experience to work for competitors.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d camera was in vented, but not by Edison or his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not only had Marey made these crucial <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s, he was happy to share what he had learned with the scientific community.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all, it was a mechanical <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fair opened in May 1893 and introduced to the world <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s such as the Ferris wheel, Cracker Jacks, and Juicy Fruit gum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He asked one of the labora tory <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants if he would mind being "chucked" out of the door while the cameras ran.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No thanks, the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant demurred, but Sandow pro ceeded anyway, grabbing him with one hand and sending him airborne through the door-too quickly for the cameras to capture.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In other short features, Dickson and his <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ers offered a little suggestion of sex, in the flashing legs of a Spanish dancer (Carmencita), and a good <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> ing of violence (Cockfight).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How profitable a business could be built upon such a base, unable to tell a story of any kind, limited to showing a glimpse of a bodybuilder, an acrobat, or a dancer? Edison and his circle could not see how to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> the medium be yond a proof-of-concept novelty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On 15 June 1894, Michael Leonard, an established fighter, met the lesser-known Jack Cushing for a six-round bout that was filmed by Dickson and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant, William Heise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" A prizefight did not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> high culture, but Edison took great personal interest in the event nonetheless.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the second, lines formed into the street, prompting a call to the police for <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> in crowd control.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The photographic equipment was much <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d: One account said that the rounds lasted ninety seconds, with only a one- to two-minute interval between each.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Corbett was <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful and made sure that the fight lasted exactly as long as the sponsors had re quested.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Wonder of <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s, this "finish fight" finished in the sixth round.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison was summoned to appear, but Mina told the authorities that he was up at Ogdensburg, working at the mine site (the documentary record leaves open the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> of where Edison was on the day of the fight itself).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the fact that Edison was indeed spending most of his time at the mine is important because it goes a long way in explaining why FUN\20S he committed the single largest blunder in his <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as inventor-cum businessperson.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>less of intellectual property issues, Edison lost the one person on his staff who would have been most valuable to him in developing a projection system.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But they failed to under stand that the wider film used in their eidoloscope could not draw in enough light to provide an image that was bright and large enough to be of commercial <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two soon quarreled over assignment of the patents-given the dis mal state of their business, this showed a hardy optimism-and dis solved their <strong style='color: red'>partnership</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" One cannot <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> but admire the obstinate way in which Edison refused to let go of his failing mining project.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> this as simply a matter of business and we trust that you will view it strictly in the same light.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The vitascope's success was credited to Edison's <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>, which gave a bright luster to his star.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>CHAPTER TEN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST in Thomas Edison's inventions rose and fell, as announcements of coming <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s would pique in terest and then delays in the delivery of those <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s would disappoint.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This business was not so easily mastered, however, and the contempt with which Edison <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed popular music did not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> him under stand his customers.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was both an engineering <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> and a commercial flop.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In order to keep the dimen sions of the unit small and its weight to twenty pounds, Edison and his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants designed the projector to accommodate filmstrips that were only eighty feet long, but it was effectively triple this length because the film was composed of three narrow ministrips, mounted side by side.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Along with the home projector, the company introduced a central clearinghouse for used films, which offered customers a way of replen ishing the family's entertainment supply by using the postal <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to swap titles with others for a nominal processing fee.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither he nor his <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants thought that the fire would spread to the neighboring con crete buildings, and no one initially took action to save what they could.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" The Times ascribed Edison's "abnormality" to his <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong>, a new concept that was explained as being beyond the control of an indi vidual's will.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor did he ever feel a civic obligation to offer <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the com munity that was his longtime home, as Insull did in Chicago.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For a founder like Edison, interested in retaining control above all else, the only possible successor would be pliable by <strong style='color: red'>temperament</strong> and a close relation by blood.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The ignominious end of the Edison Shop did not noticeably harm Charles's nascent <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er as a business executive.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His father had contin ued to run the phonograph business unilaterally as always, and the ex ecutive education he provided Charles consisted primarily of posing trivia <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s at home: How many records were rejected at the plant today? What is the name of the Edison dealer in Dubuque? Charles's promotion came only because the Naval Consulting Board needed Thomas Edison's presence full-time in Washington and at a Navy re search laboratory.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When Albert Einstein arrived in Boston, he was confronted with what one paper called the "ever-present Edison <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>naire" and was asked, "What is the speed of sound?" He was not able to say, he replied calmly through his secre tary, but pointed out that the answer was readily available in reference books.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When newspapers published the correct answers in addition to the ques tions, rendering the exam useless, Edison was undaunted and drew up a second exam consisting of <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s as picayune in nature as those in the first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor was Edi son's friendship with Henry Ford <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ful in Edison's public campaign to defend the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>naire.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In a letter to the editor of the New York Times, a resident of West Orange asked Edison to explain his close rela tionship to "a well-known automobile manufacturer whose inability to answer the most elementary <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s asked him in the courtroom about a year ago made him the laughing-stock of the entire English speaking world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Inadvertently contradicting the basic premise of the Edison <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>naire, Ford had said he was not concerned about his own lack of <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing a given topic because "I could find a man in five minutes who could tell me all about it.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Edison elected to start an entirely new <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er in industrial botany, based at his winter home in Fort Myers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the story still serves the purpose of showing Edison's desire for new challenges, even when his age was <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d and his health was failing; he suffered from diabetes and stomach problems that probably were caused by radiation exposure in his laboratory years earlier.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' " The sons could not undo decades of poor decisions that their father had made <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing the phonograph and the entertainment business.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But his reputation as the nation's super inventor nonpareil, the man who had single-handedly brought into being multiple industries, was so un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed that he did not have to do anything more in order to collect compound interest denominated in fame.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had no interest in history that was ancient and foreign and intellectual-he had followed his "history is bunk" declaration with the rhetorical <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> "What difference does it make how many times the ancient Greeks flew their kites?" -but he was passionately in terested in history that was near-recent, American, centered on technol ogy, and tactile.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He began plans to build a "historic village" in Dearborn that would provide visitors with an appreciation of the nation's techni cal <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Most of the patents were for minor variations on previous ones-more than 400 concerned electric light and power and almost 200 were for phonographs and recording-and Edison had no compunction about claiming credit for work done by <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Newspapers issued multiple bulletins each day reporting the slightest sign of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment or decline.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>His "genius" was credited in the Times with be stowing upon humanity the gifts of the electric light, the phonograph, the motion-picture camera, and "a thousand of other inventions," hy perbole that confused the patent count with separate <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When John Ott, seventy five, a retired employee who had spent his entire working <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er with \285 Edison, was told of Edison's death, he took the news hard, even though it could not have been a surprise.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whether Ott felt quite as bereft as press accounts described is an open <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, however.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had considered shutting down generators to effect a perfectly synchronized tribute but realized that it might lead to deaths; even this thought was put in <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> of a tribute to Edison, for the country's life-and-death de pendence upon electricity, he said, "is in itself a monument to Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" Edison really had been privileged to hear his own eulogy in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>: 286 / The one read at the Light's Golden Jubilee two years before was used again at his <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the culmination of a long lifetime in the business of invention, it is a sum that says much or little about Edison's <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>er and <strong style='color: red'>acumen</strong>, depending upon one's vantage point.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This arrangement spared her from being caught in cross fire be tween her stepchildren and children over the <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> of the estate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the history of modern invention, Edison fortuitously lived at just the right time, close enough to the present to be associated with the ori gins of the modern entertainment business and also the basic electrical infrastructure needed for just about everything, yet not too late to be able to get away with claiming sole authorship of the inventions pro duced in close <strong style='color: red'>collaboration</strong> with a large but publicly invisible technical staff.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Today, the proliferation of technical <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s and the anonymity of the worker bees in corporate labs who produced them prevent the emer gence of any single individual engineer who could rival Edison.</li>
