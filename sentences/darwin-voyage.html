<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>THE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE PREFACE I have stated in the preface to the first Edition of this work, and in the Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle, that it was in consequence of a wish expressed by Captain Fitz Roy, of having some scientific person on board, accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own accommodations, that I volunteered my <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>s, which received, through the kindness of the hydrographer, Captain Beaufort, the sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As I feel that the opportunities which I enjoyed of studying the Natural History of the different countries we visited, have been wholly due to Captain Fitz Roy, I hope I may here be permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him; and to add that, during the five years we were together, I received from him the most cordial friendship and steady <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance which I have received from several other naturalists, in the course of this and my other works; but I must be here allowed to return my most sincere thanks to the Reverend Professor Henslow, who, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, was one chief means of giving me a taste for Natural History,--who, during my absence, took charge of the collections I sent home, and by his correspondence directed my endeavours,--and who, since my return, has constantly rendered me every <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance which the kindest friend could offer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected, from the prevalent gloomy <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the rest of the island.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Upon examination this white stratum is found to consist of cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous matter with numerous shells embedded, most or all of which now exist on the neighbouring coast.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Even the form of a crater can but rarely be discovered on the summits of the many red cindery hills; yet the more recent streams can be distinguished on the coast, forming lines of cliffs of less height, but stretching out in <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> of those belonging to an older series: the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude measure of the age of the streams.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The colour, examined more <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong> an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae (a family of hard cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous sea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my collection I did not perceive the difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Both are of a tame and stupid <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>, and are so unaccustomed to visitors, that I could have killed any number of them with my geological hammer.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was, however, very difficult to examine them with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, for almost the instant motion ceased, even while crossing the field of vision, their bodies burst.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But on no other hypothesis can I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> their linear grouping.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Yet the host of this venda, being asked if he knew anything of a whip which one of the party had lost, gruffly answered, "How should I know? why did you not take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of it?--I suppose the dogs have eaten it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I see by my note-book, "<strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful and beautiful, flowering parasites," invariably struck me as the most novel object in these grand scenes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Interest, and not any feeling of <strong style='color: red'>compassion</strong>, prevented this act.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In endeavouring to make him <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>, I talked loud, and made signs, in doing which I passed my hand near his face.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This man had been trained to a degradation lower than the slavery of the most <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The contrast of palm trees, growing amidst the common branching kinds, never fails to give the scene an intertropical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes; but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, astonishment, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Brazilians are so dexterous with the knife, that they can throw it to some distance with <strong style='color: red'>precision</strong>, and with sufficient force to cause a fatal wound.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It has been remarked, with much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that abruptly conical hills are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the formation which Humboldt designates as gneiss-granite.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nature, in these climes, chooses her vocalists from more <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> performers than in Europe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The landscape in the neighbourhood of Bahia almost takes its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the two latter trees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Whenever I saw these little creatures buzzing round a flower, with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely visible, I was reminded of the sphinx moths: their movements and habits are indeed in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s very similar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not here refer to the number of different species, but to that of the individual insects; for on this it is that the most striking <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in the entomology of different countries depends.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>By this means many insects were fairly enclosed; and the efforts which the poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death were <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders and caterpillars, which they seem <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully to know how to sting to that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive, until their eggs are hatched; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless, half-killed victims--a sight which has been described by an enthusiastic naturalist [8] as curious and pleasing! I was much interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a Pepsis and a large spider of the genus Lycosa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At last, <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully examining with its antennae the now motionless spider, it proceeded to drag away the body.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The genus, or rather family, of Epeira, is here <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by many singular forms; some species have pointed coriaceous shells, others enlarged and spiny tibiae.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Waterhouse for his kindness in naming for me this and many other insects, and giving me much valuable <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Before making any observations <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing them, I will give an account of a little excursion I made as far as the river Polanco, which is about seventy miles distant, in a northerly direction.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was asked whether the earth or sun moved; whether it was hotter or colder to the north; where Spain was, and many other such <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that England, London, and North America, were different names for the same place; but the better informed well knew that London and North America were separate countries close together, and that England was a large town in London! I carried with me some promethean matches, which I ignited by biting; it was thought so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful that a man should strike fire with his teeth, that it was usual to collect the whole family to see it: I was once offered a dollar for a single one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Washing my face in the morning caused much speculation at the village of Las Minas; a superior tradesman closely cross-<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed me about so singular a practice; and likewise why on board we wore our beards; for he had heard from my guide that we did so.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the fine plains of turf we saw many ostriches (S<strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>io rhea).</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The difference, however, between the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the Spaniard and that of the Dutch boer is shown, by the former never asking his guest a single <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> beyond the strictest rule of politeness, whilst the honest Dutchman demands where he has been, where he is going, what is his business, and even how many brothers sisters, or children he may happen to have.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, where the trade-wind loses its regularity, and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically, the shores of the Pacific, so utterly desert in Peru, assume near Cape Blanco the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of luxuriance so celebrated at Guyaquil and Panama.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence in the southern and northern parts of the continent, the forest and desert lands occupy reversed positions with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Cordillera, and these positions are apparently determined by the direction of the prevalent winds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence perhaps it is, that there are many plants in common to the two countries but with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the trees of Tierra del Fuego, even attempts made to transplant them have failed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If a person crawling close along the ground, slowly <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s towards a herd, the deer frequently, out of curiosity, approach to reconnoitre him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Bahia Blanca, a recent establishment in Northern Patagonia, I was surprised to find how little the deer <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>d for the noise of a gun: one day I fired ten times from within eighty yards at one animal; and it was much more startled at the ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most curious fact with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to this animal, is the overpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Tucutuco (Ctenomys Brasiliensis) is a curious small animal, which may be briefly described as a Gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r, with the habits of a mole.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lamarck would have been delighted with this fact, had he known it, when speculating [7] (probably with more <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> than usual with him) on the gradually _acquired_ blindness of the Asphalax, a Gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r living under ground, and of the Proteus, a reptile living in dark caverns filled with water; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost rudimentary state, and is covered by a tendinous membrane and skin.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was several times told by the country people that there certainly is some bird having this habit; and my <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ant in collecting, who is a very accurate person, found a nest of the sparrow of this country (Zonotrichia matutina), with one egg in it larger than the others, and of a different colour and shape.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>pecoris), which has a similar cuckoo-like habit, and which is most closely allied in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the species from the Plata, even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of cattle; it differs only in being a little smaller, and in its plumage and eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Many theories, even phrenological theories, have been <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d to explain the origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds' nests.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times, and laying her eggs at intervals, the cause of her depositing her eggs in other birds' nests, and leaving them to the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of foster-parents.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct, from having been independently led (as we shall hereafter see) to an analogous conclusion with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the South American ostrich, the females of which are parasitical, if I may so express it, on each other; each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other females, and the male ostrich undertaking all the <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>s of incubation, like the strange foster-parents with the cuckoo.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears to me a curious circumstance, as showing the fine shades of difference in habits, that judging from this latter <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> alone, when I first saw this second species, I thought it was different from the Maldonado kind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Having afterwards procured a specimen, and comparing the two without particular <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, they appeared so very similar, that I changed my opinion; but now Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All these facts show that it is a bird of very versatile habits and considerable <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These birds in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s resemble in their habits the Carranchas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is said that several together (in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> resembling the Carranchas) wait at the mouth of a rabbit-hole, and together seize on the animal when it comes out.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Beudant [11] succeeded in making tubes, in most <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s similar to these fulgurites, by passing very strong shocks of galvanism through finely-powdered glass: when salt was added, so as to increase its fusibility, the tubes were larger in every dimension.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Waterhouse, and to the other gentleman attached to that Society, for their kind and most liberal <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance on all occasions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill; having there dismounted, and taken off their fur mantles, they <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d naked to the charge.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These Indians are considered civilized; but what their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> may have gained by a lesser degree of ferocity, is almost counterbalanced by their entire immorality.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous tree, which the Indians <strong style='color: red'>reverence</strong> as the altar of Walleechu.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Gauchos think that the Indians consider the tree as the god itself, but it seems for more probable that they <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> it as the altar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It differs, however, from that genus in many essential <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s; for instance, it has only three toes behind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He began to cross-<strong style='color: red'>question</strong> me in the most dignified and mysterious manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The <strong style='color: red'>duty</strong> of the women is to load and unload the horses; to make the tents for the night; in short to be, like the wives of all savages, useful slaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The men fight, hunt, take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> of the horses, and make the riding gear.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Their chief pride consists in having everything made of silver; I have seen a cacique with his spurs, stirrups, handle of his knife, and bridle made of this metal: the head-stall and reins being of wire, were not thicker than whipcord; and to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a chain, gave to the horsemanship a remarkable <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of elegance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He is a man of an extraordinary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and has a most predominant influence in the country, which it seems he will use to its prosperity and <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>ment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was assured by an English merchant, that a man who had murdered another, when arrested and <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed concerning his motive, answered, "He spoke dis<strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>fully of General Rosas, so I killed him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This change in the vegetation marks the commencement of the grand cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>o argillaceous deposit, which forms the wide extent of the Pampas, and covers the granitic rocks of Banda Oriental.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>North of the Colorado this bed thins out, and the pebbles become exceedingly small, and here the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic vegetation of Patagonia ceases.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Springing on the saddle, he managed, by a most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful exertion, just to keep ahead of the long spears of his pursuers, who followed him to within sight of the fort.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The plain, at the distance of a few miles from the coast, belongs to the great Pampean formation, which consists in part of a reddish clay, and in part of a highly cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous marly rock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Punta Alta we have a section of one of these later-formed little plains, which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the remains of gigantic land-animals embedded in it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Owen, nearest to the Cape Anteater, but in some other <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s it approaches to the armadilloes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Owen states, proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the Gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs, the order which, at the present day, includes most of the smallest quadrupeds: in many details it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging from the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably aquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>How <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully are the different Orders, at the present time so well separated, blended together in different points of the structure of the Toxodon! The remains of these nine great quadrupeds, and many detached bones, were found embedded on the beach, within the space of about 200 yards square.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Among them were the teeth of a gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>r, equalling in size and closely resembling those of the Capybara, whose habits have been described; and therefore, probably, an aquatic animal.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" [3] The great size of the bones of the Megatheroid animals, including the Megatherium, Megalonyx, Scelidotherium, and Mylodon, is truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle to naturalists, until Professor Owen [4] solved the problem with remarkable <strong style='color: red'>ingenuity</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The colossal breadth and weight of their hinder quarters, which can hardly be imagined without having been seen, become on this view, of obvious <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, instead of being an incumbrance: their apparent clumsiness disappears.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>What, it may naturally be asked, was the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the vegetation at that period; was the country as wretchedly sterile as it now is? As so many of the co-embedded shells are the same with those now living in the bay, I was at first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably similar to the existing one; but this would have been an erroneous inference for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of Brazil; and generally, the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the inhabitants of the sea are useless as guides to judge of those on the land.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, from the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s, I do not believe that the simple fact of many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round Bahia Blanca, is any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant vegetation: I have no doubt that the sterile country a little southward, near the Rio Negro, with its scattered thorny trees, would support many and large quadrupeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, however, we refer to any work of travels through the southern parts of Africa, we shall find allusions in almost every page either to the desert <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the country, or to the numbers of large animals inhabiting it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Andrew Smith, who, at the head of his adventurous party, has lately succeeded in passing the Tropic of Capricorn, informs me that, taking into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> the whole of the southern part of Africa, there can be no doubt of its being a sterile country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There can be no doubt, however, that our ideas <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the apparent amount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much exaggerated: it should have been remembered that the camel, an animal of no mean bulk, has always been considered as the emblem of the desert.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In his Travels, [6] he has suggested that the comparison of the <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive weights (if there were sufficient data) of an equal number of the largest herbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the number of large quadrupeds, there certainly exists no quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with Southern Africa.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After the different statements which have been given, the extremely desert <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of that region will not be disputed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The firm conviction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of tropical luxuriance, to support such large animals, and the impossibility of reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation, was one chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate, and of overwhelming catastrophes, which were invented to account for their entombment.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> that the male emu in the Zoological Gardens takes charge of the nest: this habit, therefore, is common to the family.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In conclusion I may observe, that the S<strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>io rhea inhabits the country of La Plata as far as a little south of the Rio Negro in lat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, and that the S<strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>io Darwinii takes its place in Southern Patagonia; the part about the Rio Negro being neutral territory.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" A very singular little bird, Tinochorus rumicivorus, is here common: in its habits and general appearance, it nearly equally partakes of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, different as they are, of the quail and snipe.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In all these <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s, in the muscular gizzard adapted for vegetable food, in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils, short legs and form of foot, the Tinochorus has a close affinity with quails.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two species of the genus Attagis are in almost every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> ptarmigans in their habits; one lives in Tierra del Fuego, above the limits of the forest land; and the other just beneath the snow-line on the Cordillera of Central Chile.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This small family of birds is one of those which, from its varied relations to other families, although at present offering only difficulties to the systematic naturalist, ultimately may <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> in revealing the grand scheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organized beings have been created.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not doubt that each bird, as often as it came to daylight on the opposite side, was greatly surprised at the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous fact.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In confirmation of this opinion, I observed a fact, which appears to me very curious and instructive, as showing how every <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, even though it may be in some degree independent of structure, has a tendency to vary by slow degrees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This Trigonocephalus has, therefore, in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s the structure of a viper, with the habits of a rattlesnake: the noise, however, being produced by a simpler device.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to each other, somewhat proportional to those of the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At Maldonado, I found one in a situation nearly as dry as at Bahia Blanca, and thinking to give it a great treat, carried it to a pool of water; not only was the little animal unable to swim, but I think without <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> it would soon have been drowned.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This transformation is one of the strangest <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>s that I saw in all my travels: for if this tree is plucked up, while young, and the leaves and bark stripped off, it becomes a hard stone when dry, much like white coral: thus is this worm twice transformed into different natures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" This is a dark picture; but how much more shocking is the un<strong style='color: red'>question</strong>able fact, that all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold blood! When I exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman, he answered, "Why, what can be done? they breed so!" Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The two first being <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>ed, answered, "No se" (I do not know), and were one after the other shot.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>General Rosas's plan is to kill all stragglers, and having driven the remainder to a common point, to attack them in a body, in the summer, with the <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong>ance of the Chilenos.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have imagined, I know not with how much <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that this granulo-pulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It consists of a crumbling argillaceo-cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous rock, which, from the dry nature of the climate, supports only scattered tufts of withered grass, without a single bush or tree to break the monotonous uniformity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its source, I do not doubt that this is the case for the Gauchos assured me, that in the middle of the dry summer, this stream, at the same time with the Colorado has periodical floods; which can only originate in the snow melting on the Andes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The distance from the posta was about six leagues over a level plain of the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain, for at the distance even of a few hundred yards the streamlets were buried and entirely lost in the friable cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous stone and loose detritus.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was also necessary to return by another road, as it was out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> to pass over the saddle-back.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner aggregated, at a period when the great cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous formation was depositing beneath the surrounding sea.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards, but with little <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In grassy plains unoccupied by the larger ruminating quadrupeds, it seems necessary to remove the superfluous vegetation by fire, so as to render the new year's growth <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In appearance and habits it resembles in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s our peewits; its wings, however, are armed with sharp spurs, like those on the legs of the common cock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The eggs of this bird are <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed a great delicacy.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous how such strong animals as deer could thus have been killed; but I have no doubt, from the evidence I have given, that the story is not in the least exaggerated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rock in this part is pure quartz; further eastward I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it is granitic.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shaw was laughed at for stating that "the flesh of the lion is in great <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong> having no small affinity with veal, both in colour, taste, and flavour.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The men who took me in the canoe, said they had long known of these skeletons, and had often <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed how they had got there: the necessity of a theory being felt, they came to the conclusion that, like the bizcacha, the mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal! In the evening we rode another stage, and crossed the Monge, another brackish stream, bearing the dregs of the washings of the Pampas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Considering that there is no natural boundary between the two places, and that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the country is nearly similar, the difference was much greater than I should have expected.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We here see at the bottom of the cliffs, beds containing sharks' teeth and sea-shells of extinct species, passing above into an indurated marl, and from that into the red clayey earth of the Pampas, with its cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This latter tooth greatly interested me, [3] and I took scrupulous <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> in ascertaining that it had been embedded contemporaneously with the other remains; for I was not then aware that amongst the fossils from Bahia Blanca there was a horse's tooth hidden in the matrix: nor was it then known with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> that the remains of horses are common in North America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lyell has lately brought from the United States a tooth of a horse; and it is an interesting fact, that Professor Owen could find in no species, either fossil or recent, a slight but peculiar curvature <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izing it, until he thought of comparing it with my specimen found here: he has named this American horse Equus curvidens.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Certainly it is a <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous fact in the history of the Mammalia, that in South America a native horse should have lived and disappeared, to be succeeded in after-ages by the countless herds descended from the few introduced with the Spanish colonists! The existence in South America of a fossil horse, of the mastodon, possibly of an elephant, [4] and of a hollow-horned ruminant, discovered by MM.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil, are highly interesting facts with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the geographical distribution of animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>South America is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by possessing many peculiar gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs, a family of monkeys, the llama, peccari, tapir, opossums, and, especially, several genera of Edentata, the order which includes the sloths, ant-eaters, and armadilloes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>North America, on the other hand, is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized (putting on one side a few wandering species) by numerous peculiar gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs, and by four genera (the ox, sheep, goat, and antelope) of hollow-horned ruminants, of which great division South America is not known to possess a single species.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it is evident that North and South America, in having within a late geological period these several genera in common, were much more closely related in the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of their terrestrial inhabitants than they now are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The more I reflect on this case, the more interesting it appears: I know of no other instance where we can almost mark the period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized zoological provinces.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The South American <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the West Indian mammals [6] seems to indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern continent, and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When America, and especially North America, possessed its elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants, it was much more closely related in its zoological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s to the temperate parts of Europe and Asia than it now is.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as so many species, both living and extinct, of these same genera inhabit and have inhabited the Old World, it seems most probable that the North American elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants migrated, on land since submerged near Behring's Straits, from Siberia into North America, and thence, on land since submerged in the West Indies, into South America, where for a time they mingled with the forms <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of that southern continent, and have since become extinct.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They all present one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; numerous willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of creeping plants, thus forming a thick jungle.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is amusing to observe, when approaching a flock, how the dog immediately <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>s barking, and the sheep all close in his rear, as if round the oldest ram.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The whole account appears to me a curious instance of the pliability of the affections in the dog; and yet, whether wild or however educated, he has a feeling of <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> or fear for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is not, however, for some weeks that the animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring, for it must learn to associate the will of its rider with the feel of the rein, before the most powerful bridle can be of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence I think there is not much difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider's spinners, and afterwards of the spider itself; the divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained, I believe by Mr.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The circumstance of spiders of the same species, but of different sexes and ages, being found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the land, attached in vast numbers to the lines, renders it probable that the habit of sailing through the air is as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of this tribe, as that of diving is of the Argyroneta.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One, which in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s is allied to the Notopods (or those crabs which have their posterior legs placed almost on their backs, for the purpose of adhering to the under side of rocks), is very remarkable from the structure of its hind pair of legs.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They then must have perceived that they were approaching the sea, for they had wheeled with the regularity of cavalry, and had returned back in as straight a line as they had <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I particularly examined the bones; they did not appear, as some scattered ones which I had seen, gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d or broken, as if dragged together by beasts of prey.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The relationship, though distant, between the Macrauchenia and the Guanaco, between the Toxodon and the Capybara,--the closer relationship between the many extinct Edentata and the living sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos, now so eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of South American zoology,--and the still closer relationship between the fossil and living species of Ctenomys and Hydrochaerus, are most interesting facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This relationship is shown <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully--as <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully as between the fossil and extinct Marsupial animals of Australia--by the great collection lately brought to Europe from the caves of Brazil by MM.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In this collection there are extinct species of all the thirty-two genera, excepting four, of the terrestrial quadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur; and the extinct species are much more numerous than those now living: there are fossil ant-eaters, armadillos, tapirs, peccaries, guanacos, opossums, and numerous South American gn<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>rs and monkeys, and other animals.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If Buffon had known of the gigantic sloth and armadillo-like animals, and of the lost Pachydermata, he might have said with a greater semblance of <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> that the creative force in America had lost its power, rather than that it had never possessed great vigour.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It appears from the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the fossils in Europe, Asia, Australia, and in North and South America, that those conditions which favour the life of the _larger_ quadrupeds were lately co-extensive with the world: what those conditions were, no one has yet even conjectured.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We are, nevertheless, seldom able with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> to tell in any given species, at what period of life, or at what period of the year, or whether only at long intervals, the check falls; or, again, what is the precise nature of the check.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no surprise at the comparative rarity of one species with another, and yet to call in some extraordinary agent and to <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong> greatly when a species ceases to exist, appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the prelude to death--to feel no surprise at sickness--but when the sick man dies to <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, and to believe that he died through violence.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to their propagation, I was told by the country people in Chile, that the condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of November and December lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare rock.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[2] The Chileno countrymen assert that the condor will live, and retain its vigour, between five and six weeks without eating: I cannot answer for the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of this, but it is a cruel experiment, which very likely has been tried.</li>

I have seen, in the Cordillera of the Andes, the evident marks where stupendous mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust, and the strata thrown of their vertical edges; but never did any scene, like these "streams of stones," so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a convulsion, of which in historical records we might in vain seek for any counterpart: yet the progress of knowledge will probably some day give a simple explanation of this phenomenon, as it already has of the so long-thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders, which are strewed over the plains of Europe.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>York Minster was a full-grown, short, thick, powerful man: his <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> was reserved, taciturn, morose, and when excited violently passionate; his affections were very strong towards a few friends on board; his intellect good.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Jemmy Button was a universal favourite, but likewise passionate; the expression of his face at once showed his nice <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He was merry and often laughed, and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in pain: when the water was rough, I was often a little sea-sick, and he used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice, "Poor, poor fellow!" but the notion, after his aquatic life, of a man being sea-sick, was too ludicrous, and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide a smile or laugh, and then he would repeat his "Poor, poor fellow!" He was of a patriotic <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>; and he liked to praise his own tribe and country, in which he truly said there were "plenty of trees," and he abused all the other tribes: he stoutly declared that there was no Devil in his land.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" It seems yet <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although all three could both speak and <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> a good deal of English, it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from them, concerning the habits of their countrymen; this was partly owing to their apparent difficulty in <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing the simplest alternative.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Every one accustomed to very young children, knows how seldom one can get an answer even to so simple a <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> as whether a thing is black or white; the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their minds.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the day was not far <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, I determined to walk there and collect plants along the road.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Among these may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass, two very <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able plants, the use of which has not been discovered by the natives.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In another harbour not far distant, a woman, who was suckling a recently-born child, came one day alongside the vessel, and remained there out of mere curiosity, whilst the sleet fell and th<strong style='color: red'>awe</strong>d on her naked bosom, and on the skin of her naked baby! These poor wretches were stunted in their growth, their hideous faces bedaubed with white paint, their skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled, their voices discordant, and their gestures violent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy: how much more reasonably the same <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> may be asked with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to these barbarians!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As far as we could make out, he seemed to consider the elements themselves as the avenging agents: it is evident in this case, how naturally, in a race a little more <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in culture, the elements would become personified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Was a more horrid deed ever perpetrated, than that witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who saw a wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant-boy, whom her husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of sea-eggs!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As we proceeded along the Beagle Channel, the scenery assumed a peculiar and very magnificent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; but the effect was much lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat, and from looking along the valley, and thus losing all the beauty of a succession of ridges.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He had already heard that his father was dead; but as he had had a "dream in his head" to that effect, he did not seem to <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> much about it, and repeatedly comforted himself with the very natural reflection--"Me no <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" He was not able to learn any particulars <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ing his father's death, as his relations would not speak about it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was laughable, but almost pitiable, to hear him speak to his wild brother in English, and then ask him in Spanish ("no sabe?") whether he did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> him.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Matthews, with his usual quiet fortitude (remarkable in a man apparently possessing little energy of <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>), determined to stay with the Fuegians, who evinced no alarm for themselves; and so we left them to pass their first awful night.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I had previously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach had been lately displaced; but until seeing this wave, I did not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the cause.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The natives did not at all <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the reason of our tacking, and, instead of meeting us at each tack, vainly strove to follow us in our zigzag course.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As we see those animals, whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a chief, are most capable of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment, so is it with the races of mankind.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In Tierra del Fuego, until some chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired advantage, such as the domesticated animals, it seems scarcely possible that the political state of the country can be <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>d.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand, it is difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> how a chief can arise till there is property of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and increase his power.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I believe, in this extreme part of South America, man exists in a lower state of <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ment than in any other part of the world.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It was long before we could clear the boat; at last we got on board with our three giants, who dined with the Captain, and behaved quite like gentlemen, <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>ing themselves with knives, forks, and spoons: nothing was so much relished as sugar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here was a view <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of Tierra del Fuego; irregular chains of hills, mottled with patches of snow, deep yellowish-green valleys, and arms of the sea intersecting the land in many directions.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have already mentioned the sombre and dull <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the evergreen forests, [3] in which two or three species of trees grow, to the exclusion of all others.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Above the forest land, there are many dwarf alpine plants, which all spring from the mass of peat, and <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to compose it: these plants are very remarkable from their close alliance with the species growing on the mountains of Europe, though so many thousand miles distant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Observing the general correspondence of the cliffs of soft sandstone, mud, and shingle, on the opposite sides of the Strait, and on some intervening islands, one is strongly tempted to believe that the land was once joined, and thus allowed animals so delicate and <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>less as the tucutuco and Reithrodon to pass over.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is, however, a remarkable coincidence, that in the two large islands cut off by the Beagle Channel from the rest of Tierra del Fuego, one has cliffs composed of matter that may be called stratified alluvium, which front similar ones on the opposite side of the channel,--while the other is exclusively bordered by old crystalline rocks: in the former, called Navarin Island, both foxes and guanacos occur; but in the latter, Hoste Island, although similar in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, and only separated by a channel a little more than half a mile wide, I have the word of Jemmy Button for saying that neither of these animals are found.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not ground this statement merely on my own observation, but I heard it from the Spanish inhabitants of the latter place, and from Jemmy Button with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to Tierra del Fuego.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>south, I saw a frog; and it is not improbable that these animals, as well as lizards, may be found as far south as the Strait of Magellan, where the country retains the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of Patagonia; but within the damp and cold limit of Tierra del Fuego not one occurs.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>That the climate would not have suited some of the orders, such as lizards, might have been foreseen; but with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to frogs, this was not so obvious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The vegetable-feeding Chrysomelidae, so eminently <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the Tropics, are here almost entirely absent; [5] I saw very few flies, butterflies, or bees, and no crickets or Orthoptera.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I do not believe they have one species in common; certainly the general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the insects is widely different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> it thus affords to vessels navigating near this stormy land is evident; and it certainly has saved many a one from being wrecked.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>An equable climate, evidently due to the large area of sea compared with the land, seems to extend over the greater part of the southern hemisphere; and, as a consequence, the vegetation partakes of a semi-tropical <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The perfect preservation of the carcasses of the Siberian elephants and rhinoceroses is certainly one of the most <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful facts in geology; but independently of the imagined difficulty of supplying them with food from the adjoining countries, the whole case is not, I think, so perplexing as it has generally been considered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--I will recapitulate the principal facts with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the climate, ice-action, and organic productions of the southern hemisphere, transposing the places in <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> to Europe, with which we are so much better acquainted.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the irregular mountains, gave the scenery a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> which to me was new and very interesting.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is said that the sap flows much more quickly on those days when the sun is powerful; and likewise, that it is absolutely necessary to take <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>, in cutting down the tree, that it should fall with its head upwards on the side of the hill; for if it falls down the slope, scarcely any sap will flow; although in that case one would have thought that the action would have been aided, instead of checked, by the force of gravity.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Who can avoid <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ing at the force which has upheaved these mountains, and even more so at the countless ages which it must have required to have broken through, removed, and levelled whole masses of them? It is well in this case to call to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of Patagonia, which, if heaped on the Cordillera, would increase its height by so many thousand feet.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When in that country, I <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ed how any mountain-chain could have supplied such masses, and not have been utterly obliterated.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must not now reverse the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>, and doubt whether all-powerful time can grind down mountains--even the gigantic Cordillera--into-gravel and mud.</li>

This Rex certainly must be a relation of the great author Finis, who wrote all books! These mines are of copper, and the ore is all shipped to Swansea, to be smelted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>My host says that the two principal <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments introduced by foreigners have been, first, reducing by previous roasting the copper pyrites--which, being the common ore in Cornwall, the English miners were astounded on their arrival to find thrown away as useless: secondly, stamping and washing the scoriae from the old furnaces--by which process particles of metal are recovered in abundance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A few <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments have likewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery; but even to the present day, water is removed from some mines by men carrying it up the shaft in leathern bags! The labouring men work very hard.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> often occurred to me--how long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>All the main valleys in the Cordillera are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by having, on both sides, a fringe or terrace of shingle and sand, rudely stratified, and generally of considerable thickness.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the lower end or mouths of the valleys, they are continuously united to those land-locked plains (also formed of shingle) at the foot of the main Cordillera, which I have described in a former chapter as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the scenery of Chile, and which were undoubtedly deposited when the sea penetrated Chile, as it now does the more southern coasts.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These alternating masses are covered in the central parts, by a great thickness of red sandstone, conglomerate, and cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous clay-slate, associated with, and passing into, prodigious beds of gypsum.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is an old story, but not the less <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, to hear of shells which were once crawling on the bottom of the sea, now standing nearly 14,000 feet above its level.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There was some <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> even in this; for upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge, I entirely forgot the puna in my delight.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The inhabitants all recommend onions for the puna; as this vegetable has sometimes been given in Europe for pectoral complaints, it may possibly be of real <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>:--for my part I found nothing so good as the fossil shells!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am sure that this extreme clearness of the air gives a peculiar <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to the landscape, all objects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane, as in a drawing or panorama.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In both cases, we must leave out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> those kinds which have been able to cross the barrier, whether of solid rock or salt-water.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We here have the agouti, bizcacha, three species of armadillo, the ostrich, certain kinds of partridges and other birds, none of which are ever seen in Chile, but are the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic animals of the desert plains of Patagonia.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The landscape has a uniform <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the Strait of Magellan, along the whole eastern coast of Patagonia, to the Rio Colorado; and it appears that the same kind of country extends inland from this river, in a sweeping line as far as San Luis and perhaps even further north.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The sky, seen through the <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d guard, appeared like a mezzotinto engraving, but the main body was impervious to sight; they were not, however, so thick together, but that they could escape a stick waved backwards and forwards.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The land, as in Chile, owes its fertility entirely to artificial irrigation; and it is really <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful to observe how extraordinarily productive a barren traversia is thus rendered.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This range has nearly the same geographical position with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Cordillera, which the gigantic Portillo line has, but it is of a totally different origin: it consists of various kinds of submarine lava, alternating with volcanic sandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits; the whole having a very close resemblance to some of the tertiary beds on the shores of the Pacific.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>From this resemblance I expected to find silicified wood, which is generally <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of those formations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These were petrified trees, eleven being silicified, and from thirty to forty converted into coarsely-crystallized white cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous spar.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Robert Brown has been kind enough to examine the wood: he says it belongs to the fir tribe, partaking of the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the Araucarian family, but with some curious points of affinity with the yew.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It required little geological practice to interpret the <strong style='color: red'>marvel</strong>lous story which this scene at once unfolded; though I confess I was at first so much astonished that I could scarcely believe the plainest evidence.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The scenery in this part had assumed a Chilian <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: the lower sides of the mountains, dotted over with the pale evergreen Quillay tree, and with the great chandelier-like cactus, are certainly more to be admired than the bare eastern valleys; but I cannot quite agree with the admiration expressed by some travellers.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fertility of the plain was delightful: the autumn being <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d, the leaves of many of the fruit-trees were falling; and of the labourers,--some were busy in drying figs and peaches on the roofs of their cottages, while others were gathering the grapes from the vineyards.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Captain Head has described the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful load which the "Apires," truly beasts of burden, carry up from the deepest mines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This appears to me a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful instance of the amount of labour which habit, for it can be nothing else, will enable a man to endure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I heard also of an old lady who, at a dinner at Coquimbo, remarked how <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully strange it was that she should have lived to dine in the same room with an Englishman; for she remembered as a girl, that twice, at the mere cry of "Los Ingleses," every soul, carrying what valuables they could, had taken to the mountains.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Shells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the terraces at Coquimbo (to a height of 250 feet), but are embedded in a friable cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous rock, which in some places is as much as between twenty and thirty feet in thickness, but is of little extent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt a copper-mine with <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is a sure game, whereas the other is gambling, or rather taking a ticket in a lottery.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the spring one <strong style='color: red'>humble</strong> little plant sends out a few leaves, and on these the snails feed.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I have observed in other places that extremely dry and sterile districts, where the soil is cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous, are extraordinarily favourable to land-shells.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Here again, there are not many spaces of two hundred yards square, where some little bush, cactus or lichen, may not be discovered by <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ful examination; and in the soil seeds lie dormant ready to spring up during the first rainy winter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In the cases of great volcanic eruptions, as that of Coseguina, where torrents of rain fell at a time of the year most unusual for it, and "almost unprecedented in Central America," it is not difficult to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> that the volumes of vapour and clouds of ashes might have disturbed the atmospheric equilibrium.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This was sometimes troublesome: I found the most ready way of explaining my employment, was to ask them how it was that they themselves were not curious concerning earthquakes and volcanos?--why some springs were hot and others cold?--why there were mountains in Chile, and not a hill in La Plata? These bare <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s at once satisfied and silenced the greater number; some, however (like a few in England who are a century behindhand), thought that all such inquiries were useless and impious; and that it was quite sufficient that God had thus made the mountains.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>, I did not hear of hydrophobia in Van Diemen's Land, or in Australia; and Burchell says, that during the five years he was at the Cape of Good Hope, he never heard of an instance of it.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A fowl costs five or six shillings; meat is nearly as dear as in England; firewood, or rather sticks, are brought on donkeys from a distance of two and three days' journey within the Cordillera; and pasturage for animals is a shilling a day: all this for South America is <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully exorbitant.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>As the peculiarly arid <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the climate is evidently a consequence of the height of the Cordillera, we may feel almost sure that before the later elevations, the atmosphere could not have been so completely drained of its moisture as it now is; and as the rise has been gradual, so would have been the change in climate.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He told me that a conjecture of a change of climate had sometimes crossed his mind; but that he thought that the greater portion of land, now incapable of cultivation, but covered with Indian ruins, had been reduced to this state by the water-conduits, which the Indians formerly constructed on so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful a scale, having been injured by neglect and by subterranean movements.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although no one has a right to speculate without distinct facts, yet even with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the Chatham Island mouse, it should be borne in mind, that it may possibly be an American species imported here; for I have seen, in a most unfrequented part of the Pampas, a native mouse living in the roof of a newly built hovel, and therefore its transportation in a vessel is not improbable: analogous facts have been observed by Dr.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>[1] The birds, plants, and insects have a desert <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, and are not more brilliantly coloured than those from southern Patagonia; we may, therefore, conclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical productions, is not related either to the heat or light of those zones, but to some other cause, perhaps to the conditions of existence being generally favourable to life.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We will now turn to the order of reptiles, which gives the most striking <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> to the zoology of these islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>May this difference not be caused, by the greater facility with which the eggs of lizards, protected by cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous shells might be transported through salt-water, than could the slimy spawn of frogs? I will first describe the habits of the tortoise (Testudo nigra, formerly called Indica), which has been so frequently alluded to.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the tortoise arrives at the spring, quite <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>less of any spectator, he buries his head in the water above his eyes, and greedily swallows great mouthfuls, at the rate of about ten in a minute.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The inhabitants say each animal stays three or four days in the neighbourhood of the water, and then returns to the lower country; but they differed <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing the frequency of these visits.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The nature of this lizard's food, as well as the structure of its tail and feet, and the fact of its having been seen voluntarily swimming out at sea, absolutely prove its aquatic habits; yet there is in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> one strange anomaly, namely, that when frightened it will not enter the water.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Humboldt has remarked that in intertropical South America, all lizards which inhabit dry regions are <strong style='color: red'>esteem</strong>ed delicacies for the table.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Neither have that rapid movement, so <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of the genera Lacerta and Iguana.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is very interesting thus to find a well-<strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized genus, having its marine and terrestrial species, belonging to so confined a portion of the world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He has been kind enough to give me the following interesting results: Of the ninety shells, no less than forty-seven are unknown elsewhere--a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact, considering how widely distributed sea-shells generally are.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I took great pains in collecting the insects, but excepting Tierra del Fuego, I never saw in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> so poor a country.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hooker informs me that the Flora has an undoubtedly Western American <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>; nor can he detect in it any affinity with that of the Pacific.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> were owing merely to immigrants from America, there would be little remarkable in it; but we see that a vast majority of all the land animals, and that more than half of the flowering plants, are aboriginal productions It was most striking to be surrounded by new birds, new reptiles, new shells, new insects, new plants, and yet by innumerable trifling details of structure, and even by the tones of voice and plumage of the birds, to have the temperate plains of Patagonia, or rather the hot dry deserts of Northern Chile, vividly brought before my eyes.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, on these small points of land, which within a late geological period must have been covered by the ocean, which are formed by basaltic lava, and therefore differ in geological <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> from the American continent, and which are placed under a peculiar climate,--why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated, I may add, in different proportions both in kind and number from those on the continent, and therefore acting on each other in a different manner--why were they created on American types of organization? It is probable that the islands of the Cape de Verd group resemble, in all their physical conditions, far more closely the Galapagos Islands, than these latter physically resemble the coast of America, yet the aboriginal inhabitants of the two groups are totally unlike; those of the Cape de Verd Islands bearing the impress of Africa, as the inhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago are stamped with that of America.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with <strong style='color: red'>certainty</strong> tell from which island any one was brought.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If the different islands have their representatives of Geospiza, it may <strong style='color: red'>help</strong> to explain the singularly large number of the species of this sub-group in this one small archipelago, and as a probable consequence of their numbers, the perfectly graduated series in the size of their beaks.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Two species of the sub-group Cactornis, and two of the Camarhynchus, were procured in the archipelago; and of the numerous specimens of these two sub-groups shot by four collectors at James Island, all were found to belong to one species of each; whereas the numerous specimens shot either on Chatham or Charles Island (for the two sets were mingled together) all belonged to the two other species: hence we may feel almost sure that these islands possess their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive species of these two sub-groups.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If we now turn to the Flora, we shall find the aboriginal plants of the different islands <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>fully different.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Too much confidence, however, must not be placed in the proportional results, as the small collections brought home by some other naturalists though in some <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s confirming the results, plainly show that much remains to be done in the botany of this group: the Leguminosae, moreover, has as yet been only approximately worked out:-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- Number of Species confined to the Number of Number of Galapagos species species Number Archipelago Total found in confined confined but found Name Number other to the to the on more of of parts of Galapagos one than the Island Species the world Archipelago island one island ---------------------------------------------------------------- James 71 33 38 30 8 Albemarle 46 18 26 22 4 Chatham 32 16 16 12 4 Charles 68 39 29 21 8 (or 29, if the probably imported plants be subtracted.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>) ---------------------------------------------------------------- Hence we have the truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful fact, that in James Island, of the thirty-eight Galapageian plants, or those found in no other part of the world, thirty are exclusively confined to this one island; and in Albemarle Island, of the twenty-six aboriginal Galapageian plants, twenty-two are confined to this one island, that is, only four are at present known to grow in the other islands of the archipelago; and so on, as shown in the above table, with the plants from Chatham and Charles Islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Again, Euphorbia, a mundane or widely distributed genus, has here eight species, of which seven are confined to the archipelago, and not one found on any two islands: Acalypha and Borreria, both mundane genera, have <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively six and seven species, none of which have the same species on two islands, with the exception of one Borreria, which does occur on two islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The distribution of the tenants of this archipelago would not be nearly so <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful, if, for instance, one island had a mocking-thrush, and a second island some other quite distinct genus,--if one island had its genus of lizard, and a second island another distinct genus, or none whatever;--or if the different islands were inhabited, not by representative species of the same genera of plants, but by totally different genera, as does to a certain extent hold good: for, to give one instance, a large berry-bearing tree at James Island has no representative species in Charles Island.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But it is the circumstance, that several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise, mocking-thrush, finches, and numerous plants, these species having the same general habits, occupying analogous situations, and obviously filling the same place in the natural economy of this archipelago, that strikes me with <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I must repeat, that neither the nature of the soil, nor height of the land, nor the climate, nor the general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the associated beings, and therefore their action one on another, can differ much in the different islands.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And lastly, the profound depth of the ocean between the islands, and their apparently recent (in a geological sense) volcanic origin, render it highly unlikely that they were ever united; and this, probably, is a far more important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> than any other, with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the geographical distribution of their inhabitants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong> is common to all the terrestrial species; namely, to the mocking-thrushes, the finches, wrens, tyrant-flycatchers, the dove, and carrion-buzzard.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It would appear that the birds of this archipelago, not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous animal than the tortoise or the Amblyrhynchus, dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> him, in the same manner as in England shy birds, such as magpies, dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the cows and horses grazing in our fields.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Falkland Islands offer a second instance of birds with a similar <strong style='color: red'>disposition</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>" From these several facts we may, I think, conclude, first, that the wildness of birds with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to man, is a particular instinct directed against _him_, and not dependent upon any general degree of caution arising from other sources of danger; secondly, that it is not acquired by individual birds in a short time, even when much persecuted; but that in the course of successive generations it becomes hereditary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the wildness of birds towards man, there is no way of accounting for it, except as an inherited habit: comparatively few young birds, in any one year, have been injured by man in England, yet almost all, even nestlings, are afraid of him; many individuals, on the other hand, both at the Galapagos and at the Falklands, have been pursued and injured by man, yet have not learned a salutary dread of him.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The season, it must be owned, had been one of great drought, and the country did not wear a favourable aspect; although I <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> it was incomparably worse two or three months before.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Macquarie figures in the map as a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able river, and it is the largest of those draining this part of the water-shed; yet to my surprise I found it a mere chain of ponds, separated from each other by spaces almost dry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Among those who, from their station in life, ought to be the best, many live in such open profligacy that <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able people cannot associate with them.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me, not <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing these subjects, very puzzling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>With <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the state of the convicts, I had still fewer opportunities of judging than on other points.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is, whether their condition is at all one of punishment: no one will maintain that it is a very severe one.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Though it is a curious fact, I was universally told that the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the convict population is one of arrant cowardice: not unfrequently some become desperate, and quite indifferent as to life, yet a plan requiring cool or continued courage is seldom put into execution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The worst feature in the whole case is, that although there exists what may be called a legal reform, and comparatively little is committed which the law can touch, yet that any moral reform should take place appears to be quite out of the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I was assured by well-informed people, that a man who should try to <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>, could not while living with other assigned servants;--his life would be one of intolerable misery and persecution.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Coming from the Spanish settlements, where such magnificent <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> has generally been paid to the fortifications, the means of defence in these colonies appeared very contemptible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although numbers of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the skirmishing, which was going on at intervals for several years; nothing seems fully to have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming power, until the whole island, in 1830, was put under martial law, and by proclamation the whole population commanded to <strong style='color: red'>assist</strong> in one great attempt to secure the entire race.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But to return to the hunting-match; the natives <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing this kind of warfare, were terribly alarmed, for they at once perceived the power and numbers of the whites.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Malays are now nominally in a state of freedom, and certainly are so, as far as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s their personal treatment; but in most other points they are considered as slaves.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width; on the lagoon side there is a white cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous beach, the radiation from which under this sultry climate was very oppressive; and on the outer coast, a solid broad flat of coral-rock served to break the violence of the open sea.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In accordance with this, the Florula has quite the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of a refuge for the destitute: Professor Henslow informs me that of the twenty species nineteen belong to different genera, and these again to no less than sixteen families!

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>--After <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to the settlement, situated at the distance of some miles, on the point of an islet thickly covered with tall cocoa-nut trees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The whole place had rather a desolate aspect, for there were no gardens to show the signs of <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> and cultivation.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>After this barbarous process the animal is suffered to regain its native element, where, after a certain time, a new shell is formed; it is, however, too thin to be of any <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>, and the animal always appears languishing and sickly.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At first I was quite at a loss to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> the cause afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following rather curious combination of circumstances.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The occurrence of this one stone, where every other particle of matter is cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous, certainly is very puzzling.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When the isolated position of these small islands in the midst of a vast ocean--their great distance from any land excepting that of coral formation, attested by the value which the inhabitants, who are such bold navigators, attach to a stone of any kind, [7]--and the slowness of the currents of the open sea, are all considered, the occurrence of pebbles thus transported does appear <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>To show the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful strength of the front pair of pincers, I may mention, that Captain Moresby confined one in a strong tin-box, which had held biscuits, the lid being secured with wire; but the crab turned down the edges and escaped.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Liesk assured us, that he had repeatedly seen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the tops of the coral branches: I opened the intestines of several, and found them distended with yellowish cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous sandy mud.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am glad we have visited these islands: such formations surely rank high amongst the <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful objects of this world.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We feel surprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the Pyramids and other great ruins, but how utterly insignificant are the greatest of these, when compared to these mountains of stone accumulated by the agency of various minute and tender animals! This is a <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> which does not at first strike the eye of the body, but, after reflection, the eye of reason.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The earlier voyagers fancied that the coral-building animals instinctively built up their great circles to afford themselves protection in the inner parts; but so far is this from the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, that those massive kinds, to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the very existence of the reef depends, cannot live within the lagoon, where other delicately-branching kinds flourish.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The theory that has been most generally received is, that atolls are based on submarine craters; but when we consider the form and size of some, the number, proximity, and relative positions of others, this idea loses its plausible <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: thus Suadiva atoll is 44 geographical miles in diameter in one line, by 34 miles in another line; Rimsky is 54 by 20 miles across, and it has a strangely sinuous margin; Bow atoll is 30 miles long, and on an average only 6 in width; Menchicoff atoll consists of three atolls united or tied together.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>A third and better theory was <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by Chamisso, who thought that from the corals growing more vigorously where exposed to the open sea, as undoubtedly is the case, the outer edges would grow up from the general foundation before any other part, and that this would account for the ring or cup-shaped structure.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But we shall immediately see, that in this, as well as in the crater-theory, a most important <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> has been overlooked, namely, on what have the reef-building corals, which cannot live at a great depth, based their massive structures? Numerous soundings were <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully taken by Captain Fitz Roy on the steep outside of Keeling atoll, and it was found that within ten fathoms, the prepared tallow at the bottom of the lead, invariably came up marked with the impression of living corals, but as perfectly clean as if it had been dropped on a carpet of turf; as the depth increased, the impressions became less numerous, but the adhering particles of sand more and more numerous, until at last it was evident that the bottom consisted of a smooth sandy layer: to carry on the analogy of the turf, the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner, till at last the soil was so sterile, that nothing sprang from it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>It is remarkable how little attention has been paid to encircling barrier-reefs; yet they are truly <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful structures.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The section in this state resembles in every <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> one drawn through an encircled island: in fact, it is a real section (on the scale of .</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I venture, therefore, to affirm, that on the theory of the upward growth of the corals during the sinking of the land, [13] all the leading features in those <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful structures, the lagoon-islands or atolls, which have so long excited the attention of voyagers, as well as in the no less <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful barrier-reefs, whether encircling small islands or stretching for hundreds of miles along the shores of a continent, are simply explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, at Keeling atoll I observed on all sides of the lagoon old cocoa-nut trees undermined and falling; and in one place the foundation-posts of a shed, which the inhabitants asserted had stood seven years before just above high-water mark, but now was daily washed by every tide: on <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> I found that three earthquakes, one of them severe, had been felt here during the last ten years.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Not only the grand features in the structure of barrier-reefs and of atolls, and to their likeness to each other in form, size, and other <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s, are explained on the theory of subsidence--which theory we are independently forced to admit in the very areas in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, from the necessity of finding bases for the corals within the requisite depth--but many details in structure and exceptional cases can thus also be simply explained.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I will not enter on many more details; but I must remark that the curious structure of the northern Maldiva atolls receives (taking into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> the free entrance of the sea through their broken margins) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the corals, originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons, such as occur in common atolls, and on broken portions of the linear marginal reef, such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moresby (to whom I am indebted for much invaluable information), is of vast size, namely, ninety nautical miles across in one direction, and seventy miles in another line; and is in many <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s eminently curious.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Taking into <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong> the proofs of recent elevation both on the fringed coasts and on some others (for instance, in South America) where there are no reefs, we are led to conclude that the great continents are for the most part rising areas: and from the nature of the coral-reefs, that the central parts of the great oceans are sinking areas.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Taking a final view of the map, and bearing in mind the statements made with <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the upraised organic remains, we must feel astonished at the vastness of the areas, which have suffered changes in level either downwards or upwards, within a period not geologically remote.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The reef-constructing corals have indeed reared and preserved <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong>ful memorials of the subterranean oscillations of level; we see in each barrier-reef a proof that the land has there subsided, and in each atoll a monument over an island now lost.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>"--The naturalists, however, of this expedition differ with me on some points <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ing coral formations.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Although the island has been so many years under the English Government, the general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the place is quite French: Englishmen speak to their servants in French, and the shops are all French; indeed, I should think that Calais or Boulogne was much more Anglified.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We were also surprised at seeing large booksellers' shops, with well-stored shelves;--music and reading bespeak our approach to the old world of civilization; for in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> both Australia and America are new worlds.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The scenery may be described as intermediate in <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> between that of the Galapagos and of Tahiti; but this will convey a definite idea to very few persons.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The town runs up a flat and narrow valley; the houses look <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able, and are interspersed with a very few green trees.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>, and at the trifling elevation of 1500 feet, it is surprising to behold a vegetation possessing a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> decidedly British.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>When we consider that the number of plants now found on the island is 746, and that out of these fifty-two alone are indigenous species, the rest having been imported, and most of them from England, we see the reason of the British <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the vegetation.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The English, or rather Welsh <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the scenery, is kept up by the numerous cottages and small white houses; some buried at the bottom of the deepest valleys, and others mounted on the crests of the lofty hills.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On viewing the island from an eminence, the first circumstance which strikes one, is the number of the roads and forts: the labour bestowed on the public works, if one forgets its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as a prison, seems out of all proportion to its extent or value.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Viewed from a short distance, it appears like a <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>able gentleman's country-seat.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Similar <strong style='color: red'>care</strong> is displayed in each part of the establishment, and especially in the management of the springs, so that a single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I could not <strong style='color: red'>help</strong>, when admiring the active industry, which had created such effects out of such means, at the same time regretting that it had been wasted on so poor and trifling an end.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In former times a long spit of this nature seems to have become consolidated by the percolation of cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous matter, and afterwards to have been gradually upheaved; the outer and loose parts during this process having been worn away by the action of the sea, and the solid nucleus left as we now see it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This durability is much the most curious fact in its history: it is due to a tough layer, a few inches thick, of cal<strong style='color: red'>care</strong>ous matter, wholly formed by the successive growth and death of the small shells of Serpulae, together with some few barnacles and nulliporae.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These insignificant organic beings, especially the Serpulae, have done good <strong style='color: red'>service</strong> to the people of Pernambuco; for without their protective aid the bar of sandstone would inevitably have been long ago worn away and without the bar, there would have been no harbour.</li>

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Other losses, although not at first felt, tell heavily after a period: these are the want of room, of seclusion, of rest; the jading feeling of constant hurry; the privation of small luxuries, the loss of domestic society and even of music and the other pleasures of <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Besides the vast <strong style='color: red'>improve</strong>ments in ships and naval resources, the whole western shores of America are thrown open, and Australia has become the capital of a rising continent.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I confess, however, my <strong style='color: red'>imagination</strong> had painted something more grand, more terrific in the full-grown storm.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is a growing pleasure in comparing the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the scenery in different countries, which to a certain degree is distinct from merely admiring its beauty.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>I am strongly induced to believe that as in music, the person who <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>s every note will, if he also possesses a proper taste, more thoroughly enjoy the whole, so he who examines each part of a fine view, may also thoroughly comprehend the full and combined effect.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They can be described only by negative <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>s; without habitations, without water, without trees, without mountains, they support merely a few dwarf plants.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, then, and the case is not peculiar to myself, have these arid wastes taken so firm a hold on my memory? Why have not the still more level, the greener and more fertile Pampas, which are <strong style='color: red'>service</strong>able to mankind, produced an equal impression?

<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Each part assumes its proper dimensions: continents are not looked at in the light of islands, or islands considered as mere specks, which are, in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, larger than many kingdoms of Europe.</li>
