<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, indeed, the early philosophers are divided.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And yet Anaxagoras himself failed to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> his own utterance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the followers of Anaxagoras <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the 'homoeomeries' as 'simple' and elements, whilst they affirm that Earth, Fire, Water, and Air are composite; for each of these is (according to them) a 'common seminary' of all the 'homoeomeries'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For 'alteration, as we assert, takes place in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to certain qualities: and these qualities (I mean, e.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>hot-cold, white-black, dry-moist, soft-hard, and so forth) are, all of them, differences <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izing the 'elements'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The actual words of Empedocles may be quoted in illustration- The sun everywhere bright to see, and hot, The rain everywhere dark and cold; and he distinctively <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izes his remaining elements in a similar manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence it was clearly out of a One that this came-to-be Water, and that Fire, various portions of it being separated off by certain <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences or qualities-as indeed he calls the sun 'white and hot', and the earth 'heavy and hard'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, therefore, these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic differences be taken away (for they can be taken away, since they came-to-be), it will clearly be inevitable for Earth to come to-be out of Water and Water out of Earth, and for each of the other elements to undergo a similar transformation-not only then, but also now-if, and because, they change their qualities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Are we to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the One as his 'original real'? Or is it the Many-i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For though, no doubt, Plato investigated the conditions under which things come-to-be and pass-away, he confined his <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong> to these changes; and he discussed not all coming-to-be, but only that of the elements.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He asked no <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s as to how flesh or bones, or any of the other similar compound things, come-to-be; nor again did he examine the conditions under which 'alteration' or growth are attributable to things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Democritus, however, does seem not only to have thought <strong style='color: red'>care</strong>fully about all the problems, but also to be distinguished from the outset by his method.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And since they thought that the '<strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> lay in the appearance, and the appearances are conflicting and infinitely many, they made the 'figures' infinite in number.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The fundamental <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, in dealing with all these difficulties, is this: 'Do things come-to-be and "alter" and grow, and undergo the contrary changes, because the primary "reals" are indivisible magnitudes? Or is no magnitude indivisible?' For the answer we give to this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> makes the greatest difference.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The rival treatments of the subject now before us will serve to illustrate how great is the difference between a 'scientific' and a 'dialectical' method of <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There is, besides, this further <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The necessary consequence-especially if coming-to-be and passing-away are to take place by 'association' and 'dissociation' <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively-is that a body must contain atomic magnitudes which are invisible.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, if'unqualified not-being 'means the negation of 'being' in the sense of the primary term of the Category in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, we shall have, in 'unqualified coming-to-be', a coming-to-be of a substance out of not-substance.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> might be raised whether substance (i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Is it not rather the 'such', the 'so great', or the 'somewhere', which comes-to-be? And the same <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> might be raised about 'passing-away' also.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must therefore concentrate all our powers on the discussion of these difficulties and on the solution of a further <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And the accurate treatment of the first of these-of the immovable 'originative source'-belongs to the province of the other, or 'prior', philosophy: while as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s 'that which sets everything else in motion by being itself continuously moved', we shall have to explain later' which amongst the so-called 'specific' causes exhibits this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For perhaps, if we succeed in clearing up this <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, it will simultaneously become clear what account we ought to give of that which perplexed us just now, i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our new <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> too-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Why, then, is this form of change necessarily ceaseless? Is it because the passing-away of this is a coming-to-be of something else, and the coming-to-be of this a passing-away of something else? The cause implied in this solution must no doubt be considered adequate to account for coming-to-be and passing-away in their general <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> as they occur in all existing things alike.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For we are trying to discover not what undergoes these changes, but what is their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic manner.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We have thus stated one <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic manner in which unqualified will be distinguished from qualified coming-to-be and passing-away: but they are also distinguished according to the special nature of the material of the changing thing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence, just as they deem themselves to live and to 'be' in virtue of their perceiving or their capacity to perceive, so too they deem the things to 'be' qua perceived or perceptible-and in this they are in a sense on the track of the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, though what they actually say is not true.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Thus unqualified coming-to-be and passingaway turn out to be different according to common opinion from what they are in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For Wind and Air are in <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> more real more a 'this somewhat' or a 'form'-than Earth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> subsequently formulated involves a different problem-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But there is no need even to discuss the other <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> we raised-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>contraries out of contraries? For these things-Fire, Earth, Water, Air-are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by 'the contraries'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Since, then, we must distinguish (a) the substratum, and (b) the property whose nature it is to be predicated of the substratum; and since change of each of these occurs; there is 'alteration' when the substratum is perceptible and persists, but changes in its own properties, the properties in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> being opposed to one another either as contraries or as intermediates.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>(Hence, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s man, these changes are 'modifications'; though, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s musical man and unmusical man, they are a passing-away and a coming-to-be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So much, then, as an answer to the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>s (i) whether coming-to-be 'is' or 'is not'-i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence our first <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is this: Do these changes differ from one another solely because of a difference in their <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ive 'spheres'? In other words, do they differ because, while a change from this to that (viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>from potential to actual substance) is coming-to-be, a change in the sphere of magnitude is growth and one in the sphere of quality is 'alteration'-both growth and 'alteration' being changes from what is-potentially to what is-actually magnitude and quality <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively? Or is there also a difference in the manner of the change, since it is evident that, whereas neither what is 'altering' nor what is coming-to-be necessarily changes its place, what is growing or diminishing changes its spatial position of necessity, though in a different manner from that in which the moving thing does so? For that which is being moved changes its place as a whole: but the growing thing changes its place like a metal that is being beaten, retaining its position as a whole while its parts change their places.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But the same reasons also forbid us to <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> the matter, out of which the body comes-to-be, as points or lines.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, since there is also a matter out of which corporeal substance itself comes-to-be (corporeal substance, however, already <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized as such-and-such a determinate body, for there is no such thing as body in general), this same matter is also the matter of magnitude and quality-being separable from these matters by definition, but not separable in place unless Qualities are, in their turn, separable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Moreover, a change of that kind is not peculiarly distinctive of growth, but <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izes coming-to-be as such or in general.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence growth must not be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as a process from a matter without magnitude to an actuality of magnitude: for this would be a body's coming-to-be rather than its growth.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must therefore come to closer quarters with the subject of our <strong style='color: red'>inquiry</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We must grapple' with it (as it were) from its beginning, and determine the precise <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the growing and diminishing whose causes we are investigating.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For our account of growth must preserve the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of that which is growing and diminishing.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics are three: (i) any and every part of the growing magnitude is made bigger (e.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now if the generation of air from water is to be <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>ed as growth, a thing might grow without the accession (and without the persistence) of anything, and diminish without the departure of anything-and that which grows need not persist.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic must be preserved: for the growth we are discussing has been assumed to be thus <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Flesh is said to have been 'altered' if, while its <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> and substance remain, some one of its essential properties, which was not there before, now qualifies it: on the other hand, that 'whereby' it has been 'altered' may have undergone no change, though sometimes it too has been affected.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Our solution must preserve intact the three <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istics of growth-that the growing thing persists, that it grows by the accession (and diminishes by the departure) of something, and further that every perceptible particle of it has become either larger or smaller.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For there has been an accession to every part of the flesh in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its form, but not in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to its matter.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>One might discuss what must be the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of that 'whereby' a thing grows.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> Diogenes is right when he argues that 'unless all things were derived from one, reciprocal action and passion could not have occurred'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No doubt, it is not true to say that all things are of this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: but it is true of all things between which there is reciprocal action and passion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>a quality, like white' or 'hot', in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to which they are moved' only in the sense that they are 'altered': on the contrary, to 'impart motion' is a wider term than to 'act'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For (i) if A and B are 'like'-absolutely and in all <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>s without difference from one another -it is reasonable to infer that neither is in any way affected by the other.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>in no <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> identical.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>'like') but specifically 'unlike', while (b) it is 'contraries' that exhibit this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: it is clear that 'contraries' and their 'intermediates' are such as to suffer action and to act reciprocally-for indeed it is these that constitute the entire sphere of passing-away and coming-to-be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>We can now <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why fire heats and the cold thing cools, and in general why the active thing assimilates to itself the patient.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>of 'the man' as being healed, being warmed and chilled, and similarly in all the other cases), but at other times we say 'what is cold is 'being warmed', 'what is sick is being healed': and in both these ways of speaking we express the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, since in one sense it is the 'matter', while in another sense it is the 'contrary', which suffers action.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Now, in motion, there is nothing to prevent the firs; mover being unmoved (indeed, as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s some 'first' movers' this is actually necessary) although the last mover always imparts motion by being itself moved: and, in action, there is nothing to prevent the first agent being unaffected, while the last agent only acts by suffering action itself.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Such was the theory which some philosophers (induding Empedocles) <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the structure of certain bodies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The most systematic and consistent theory, however, and one that applied to all bodies, was <strong style='color: red'>advance</strong>d by Leucippus and Democritus: and, in maintaining it, they took as their starting-point what naturally comes first.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And in this <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>, they insist, the view that the universe is not 'continuous' but 'discretes-in-contact' is no better than the view that there are 'many' (and not 'one') and a void.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Reasoning in this way, therefore, they were led to transcend sense-perception, and to dis<strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> it on the ground that 'one ought to follow the argument': and so they assert that the universe is 'one' and immovable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>There were, then, certain thinkers who, for the reasons we have stated, enunciated views of this kind as their theory of 'The Truth'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And as <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong>s the Atomists, it is not only clear what their explanation is: it is also obvious that it follows with tolerable consistency from the assumptions they employ.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For although both Plato and Leucippus postulate elementary constituents that are indivisible and distinctively <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by figures, there is this great difference between the two theories: the 'indivisibles' of Leucippus (i) are solids, while those of Plato are planes, and (ii) are <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized by an infinite variety of figures, while the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>izing figures employed by Plato are limited in number.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>' But with <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the assumption of 'indivisible solids', although we must not now enter upon a detailed study of its consequences, the following criticisms fall within the compass of a short digression: i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>But if that is their <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>, it is impossible they should not be affected by one another: the 'slightly-hot indivisible', e.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>some of them, in their aggregated bulk, were 'fiery', others earthy'? For (i) if all of them are uniform in substance, what is it that separated one from another? Or why, when they come into contact, do they not coalesce into one, as drops of water run together when drop touches drop (for the two cases are precisely parallel)? On the other hand (ii) if they fall into differing sets, how are these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized? It is clear, too, that these, rather than the 'figures', ought to be postulated as 'original reals', i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>If, on the other hand, each of them sets itself in motion, either (a) it will be divisible ('imparting motion' qua this, 'being moved' qua that), or (b) contrary properties will attach to it in the same <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>-i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For some things display a hesitating and ambiguous attitude towards one another-showing a slight tendency to combine and also an inclination to behave as 'receptive matter' and 'form' <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the contrary: anything is 'combinable' which, being readily adaptable in shape, is such as to suffer action and to act; and it is 'combinable with' another thing similarly <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized (for the 'combinable' is relative to the 'combinable'); and 'combination' is unification of the 'combinables', resulting from their 'alteration'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the complex substances whose formation and maintenance are due to natural processes all presuppose the perceptible bodies as the condition of their coming-to-be and passing-away: but philosophers disagree in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the matter which underlies these perceptible bodies.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, even so the <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> remains: What sorts of contrarieties, and how many of them, are to be accounted 'originative sources' of body? For all the other thinkers assume and use them without explaining why they are these or why they are just so many.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For (a) since the moist has no determinate shape, but is readily adaptable and follows the outline of that which is in contact with it, it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of it to be 'such as to fill up'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For the fine' consists of subtle particles; but that which consists of small particles is 'such as to fill up', inasmuch as it is in contact whole with whole-and 'the fine' exhibits this <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> in a superlative degree.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For freezing and boiling are excesses of heat and cold <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nevertheless, since they are four, each of them is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ized par excellence a single quality: Earth by dry rather than by cold, Water by cold rather than by moist, Air by moist rather than by hot, and Fire by hot rather than by dry.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>At the same time, it is manifest, even on the evidence of perception, that they do come-to-be: for otherwise there would not have been 'alteration, since 'alteration' is change in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to the qualities of the objects of touch.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>On the other hand (ii) the transformation of Fire into Water and of Air into Earth, and again of Water and Earth into Fire and Air <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively, though possible, is more difficult because it involves the change of more qualities.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>So' too, if Water and Earth are to result from Fire and Air <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong>ively-both qualities must change.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Assuming, then, that the contrariety, in <strong style='color: red'>respect</strong> to which they are transformed, is one, the elements' will inevitably be two: for it is 'matter' that is the 'mean' between the two contraries, and matter is imperceptible and inseparable from them.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>that the process cannot continue ad infinitum-will be clear from the following <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 6 As for those who agree with Empedocles that the 'elements' of body are more than one, so that they are not transformed into one another-one may well <strong style='color: red'>wonder</strong> in what sense it is open to them to maintain that the 'elements' are comparable.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>No: the cause in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> is the essential nature of each thing-not merely to quote his words) 'a mingling and a divorce of what has been mingled'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>He ought, then, either to have defined or to have postulated these <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic movements, or to have demonstrated them-whether strictly or laxly or in some other fashion.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>is the change from being musical to being unmusical, or how is memory or forgetting, to occur? For clearly, if the soul be Fire, only such modifications will happen to it as <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>ize Fire qua Fire: while if it be compounded out of the elements', only the corporeal modifications will occur in it.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Those, however, who maintain the theory in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong>, are not at liberty to conceive that 'both come-to-be out of flesh' in that manner, but only as a stone and a brick 'both come-to-be out of a wall'-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>This fact enables us to <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong> why, whereas all the 'simple' bodies come-to-be out of one another, Fire is the only one of them which (as our predecessors also assert) 'is fed'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Part 9 Since some things are such as to come-to-be and pass-away, and since coming-to-be in fact occurs in the region about the centre, we must explain the number and the nature of the 'originative sources' of all coming-to-be alike: for a grasp of the true theory of any universal facilitates the <strong style='color: red'>understand</strong>ing of its specific forms.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Hence he thinks that 'assuming the <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong> of these theses, the Forms must be causes both of coming-to-be and of passing-away'.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>For, to begin with, it is <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>istic of matter to suffer action, i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And what is more, since they remove the formal cause, they invest the forces they assign to the 'simple' bodies-the forces which enable these bodies to bring things into being-with too instrumental a <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Consequently the phenomenon in <strong style='color: red'>question</strong> occurs, because the 'irregular' coming-to-be of these things is the passing-away of other things.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>These <strong style='color: red'>consideration</strong>s serve at the same time to explain what is to some people a baffling problem-viz.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>They are transformed, however, owing to the motion with its dual <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>: and because they are transformed, none of them is able to persist in any place allotted to it by the Order.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>And (b) since (to appeal to a general principle) amongst the things which 'are' some are capable also of 'not-being', it is clear that the same ambiguous <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> will attach to them no less when they are coming-to-be: in other words, their coming-to-be will not be necessary.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Then are all the things that come-to-be of this contingent <strong style='color: red'>character</strong>? Or, on the contrary, is it absolutely necessary for some of them to come-to-be? Is there, in fact, a distinction in the field of 'coming-to-be' corresponding to the distinction, within the field of 'being', between things that cannot possibly 'not-be' and things that can 'not-be'? For instance, is it necessary that solstices shall come-to-be, i.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Nor again (ii) will it be possible to say with <strong style='color: red'>truth</strong>, even in <strong style='color: red'>regard</strong> to the members of a limited sequence, that it is 'absolutely necessary' for any one of them to come-to-be.</li>
<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>In consequence of this distinction, it is evident that those things, whose 'substance'-that which is undergoing the process-is imperishable, will be numerically, as well as specifically, the same in their recurrence: for the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of the process is determined by the <strong style='color: red'>character</strong> of that which undergoes it.</li>
