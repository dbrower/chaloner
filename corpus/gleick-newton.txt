ISAAC NEWTON


ISAAC NEWTON SAID he had seen farther by standing on
the shoulders of giants, but he did not believe it. He was
born into a world of darkness, obscurity, and magic; led a
strangely pure and obsessive life, lacking parents, lovers,
and friends; quarreled bitterly with great men who crossed
his path; veered at least once to the brink of madness;
cloaked his work in secrecy; and yet discovered more of
the essential core of human knowledge than anyone be­
fore or after. He was chief architect of the modern world.
He answered the ancient philosophical riddles of light and
motion, and he effectively discovered gravity. He showed
how to predict the courses of heavenly bodies and so estab­
lished our place in the cosmos. He made knowledge a thing
of substance: quantitative and exact. He established princi­
ples, and they are called his laws.
Solitude was the essential part of his genius. As a youth
he assimilated or rediscovered most of the mathematics
known to humankind and then invented the calculus-the
machinery by which the modern world understands change
and flow-but kept this treasure to himself. He embraced
his isolation through his productive years, devoting himself
3

ISAAC NEWTON
to the most secret of sciences, alchemy. He feared the light
of exposure, shrank from criticism and controversy, and
seldom published his work at all. Striving to decipher
the riddles of the universe, he emulated the complex se­
crecy in which he saw them encoded. He stood aloof from
other philosophers even after becoming a national icon­
Sir Isaac, Master of the Mint, President of the Royal Soci­
ety, his likeness engraved on medals, his discoveries exalted
m verse.
"I don't know what I may seem to the world," he said
before he died, "but, as to myself, I seem to have been only
like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in
now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undis­
covered before me." 1 An evocative simile, much quoted in
the centuries that followed, but Newton never played at the
seashore, boy or man. Born in a remote country village, the
son of an illiterate farmer, he lived in an island nation and
explained how the moon and sun tug at the seas to create
tides, but he probably never set eyes on the ocean. He
understood the sea by abstraction and computation.
His life's path across the earth's surface covered barely
150 miles: from a hamlet of rural Lincolnshire southward to
the university town of Cambridge and thence to London.
He was born in the bedchamber of a stone farmhouse on
Christmas 1642 (as the calendar was reckoned in Eng­
land-but the calendar was drifting out of step with the
sun). His father, Isaac Newton, yeoman, had married at
thirty-five, fallen ill, and died before his son's birth. English
had a word for that: the child was posthumous, thought
unlikely to resemble the father.
4

ISAAC NEWTON
This first Isaac Newton left little trace: some sheep, bar­
ley, and simple furniture. He endorsed his will with his X,
for like most of his countrymen he could neither read nor
write. He had worked the land of Woolsthorpe, a place of
woods, open heaths, brooks, and springs, where underneath
the thin soil lay a gray limestone, from which a few dwellings
were built to last longer than the common huts of timber
and clay. A road of the Roman Empire passed nearby, run­
ning south and north, a reminder of ancient technology still
unsurpassed. Sometimes children unearthed antique coins
or remains of a villa or wall."
The second Isaac Newton lived to be eighty-four, gouty
and rich. He died in London at the end of the winter of
1 727, a prolonged and excruciating death from a kidney
stone. England for the first time granted a state funeral to
a subject whose attainment lay in the realm of the mind.
The Lord Chancellor, two dukes, and three earls bore the
pall, with most of the Royal Society following behind. The
corpse lay in state in Westminster Abbey for eight days and
was buried in its nave. Above the grave was carved an ornate
monument in gray and white marble: the figure of Newton,
recumbent; the celestial globe, marked with the path of a
1680 comet; and angelic boys playing with a prism and
weighing the sun and planets. A Latin inscription hailed his
"strength of mind almost divine" and "mathematical princi­
ples peculiarly his own" and declared: "Mortals rejoice that
there has existed so great an ornament of the human race."
For England, the continent of Europe, and then the rest of
the world, Newton's story was beginning.
The French writer calling himself Voltaire had just
reached London. He was amazed by the kingly funeral and
5

ISAAC NEWTON
exhilarated by all things Newtonian. "A Frenchman arriv­
ing in London finds things very different," he reported.
"For us it is the pressure of the moon that causes the tides
of the sea; for the English it is the sea that gravitates towards
the moon, so that when you think that the moon should
give us a high tide, these gentlemen think you should have a
low one." It pleased Voltaire to compare Newton with his
nation's late philosophical hero, René Descartes: "For your
Cartesians everything is moved by an impulsion you don't
really understand, for Mr Newton it is by gravitation, the
cause of which is hardly better known." The most funda­
mental conceptions were new and up for grabs in coffee­
houses and salons. "In Paris you see the earth shaped like a
melon, in London it is flattened on two sides. For a Carte­
sian light exists in the air, for a Newtonian it comes from
the sun in six and a half minutes." Descartes was a dreamer;
Newton a sage. Descartes experienced poetry and love;
Newton did not. "In the course of such a long life he had
neither passion nor weakness; he never went near any
woman. I have had that confirmed by the doctor and the
surgeon who were with him when he died.">
What Newton learned remains the essence of what we
know, as if by our own intuition. Newton's laws are our
laws. We are Newtonians, fervent and devout, when we
speak of forces and masses, of action and reaction; when we
say that a sports team or political candidate has momen­
tum; when we note the inertia of a tradition or bureaucracy;
and when we stretch out an arm and feel the force of grav­
ity all around, pulling earthward. Pre-Newtonians did not
feel such a force. Before Newton the English word gravity
denoted a mood-seriousness, solemnity-or an intrinsic
6

ISAAC NEWTON
quality. Objects could have heaviness or lightness, and the
heavy ones tended downward, where they belonged."
We have assimilated N ewtonianism as knowledge and as
faith. We believe our scientists when they compute the past
and future tracks of comets and spaceships. What is more,
we know they do this not by magic but by mere technique.
"The landscape has been so totally changed, the ways of
thinking have been so deeply affected, that it is very hard to
get hold of what it was like before," said the cosmologist
and relativist Hermann Bondi. "It is very hard to realize
how total a change in outlook he produced."> Creation,
Newton saw, unfolds from simple rules, patterns iterated
over unlimited distances. So we seek mathematical laws for
economic cycles and human behavior. We deem the uni­
verse solvable.
He began with foundation stones of knowledge: time,
space, motion. I do not define time) space) place) and motion) as
being well known to all) he wrote in midlife-then a reclusive
professor, recondite theologian and alchemist, seldom leav­
ing his room in Trinity College, Cambridge." But he did
mean to define these terms. He salvaged them from the
haze of everyday language. He standardized them. In defin­
ing them, he married them, each to the others.
He dipped his quill in an ink of oak galls and wrote a
minuscule Latin script, crowding the words edge to edge:
The common people conceive those quantities under no other
notions but from the relation they bear to sensible objects. And
thence arise certain prejudices. . . . By then he had written
more than a million words and published almost none. He
wrote for himself, careless of food and sleep. He wrote to
calculate, laying down numbers in spidery lines and broad
7

ISAAC NEWTON
columns. He computed as most people daydream. The flow
of his thought slipped back and forth between English and
Latin. He wrote to read, copying out books and manu­
scripts verbatim, sometimes the same text again and again.
More determined than joyful, he wrote to reason, to medi­
tate, and to occupy his febrile mind.
His name betokens a system of the world. But for New­
ton himself there was no completeness, only a questing­
dynamic, protean, and unfinished. He never fully detached
matter and space from God. He never purged occult, hid­
den, mystical qualities from his vision of nature. He sought
order and believed in order but never averted his eyes from
the chaos. He of all people was no Newtonian.
Information flowed faintly and perishably then, through
the still small human species, but he created a method and
a language that triumphed in his lifetime and gained ascen­
dancy with each passing century. He pushed open a door
that led to a new universe: set in absolute time and space, at
once measureless and measurable, furnished with science
and machines, ruled by industry and natural law. Geometry
and motion, motion and geometry: Newton joined them as
one. With the coming of Einstein's relativity, Newtonian
science was often said to have been "overthrown" or "re­
placed," but that was not so. It had been buttressed and
extended."
"Fortunate Newton, happy childhood of science!" said
Einstein. "Nature to him was an open book. He stands
before us strong, certain, and alone."8
Yet he speaks to us reluctantly and covertly.

What Imployrnent
Is He Fit For?
MEDIEVAL, IN SOME DISREPAIR, the Woolsthorpe farm­
house nestled into a hill near the River Witham. With
its short front door and shuttered windows, its working
kitchen, and its bare floors of ash and linden laid on reeds,
it had belonged to Newton's forebears for just twenty years.
In back stood apple trees. Sheep grazed for acres around.
Isaac was born in a small room at the top of the stairs. By
the terms of feudal law this house was a manor and the
fatherless boy was its lord, with seigniorial authority over a
handful of tenant farmers in nearby cottages. He could not
trace his ancestry back past his grandfather, Robert, who
lay buried in the churchyard nearly a mile to the east. Still,
the boy expected to live managing the farm in the place
of the father he had never known. His mother, Hannah
Ayscough, had come from gentlefolk. Her brother, the Rev­
erend William Ayscough, studied at Cambridge University
on his way to joining the Anglican clergy; now he occupied a
village rectory two miles away. When Isaac was three years
old and his widowed mother near thirty, she accepted a
marriage offer from another nearby rector, Barnabas Smith,
a wealthy man twice her age. Smith wanted a wife, not a
9

ISAAC NEWTON
stepson; under the negotiated terms of their marriage Han­
nah abandoned Isaac in the Woolsthorpe house, leaving
him to his grandmother's care. I
War flared in the countryside all through his youth.
The decade-long Great Rebellion began in the year of his
birth: Parliamentarians fighting Royalists, Puritans recoil­
ing from the idolatry they saw in the Church of England.
Motley, mercenary armies skirmished throughout the Mid­
lands. Pikemen and musketeers sometimes passed through
the fields near Woolsthorpe.2 Bands of men plundered
farms for supplies. England was at war with itself and also,
increasingly, aware of itself-its nationhood, its specialness.
Divided as it was, convulsed over ecclesiastical forms and
beliefs, the nation carried out a true revolution. The tri­
umphant Puritans rejected absolutism and denied the divine
right of the monarchy. In 1649, soon after Isaac turned six,
Charles Stuart, the king, was beheaded at the wall of his
palace.
This rustic country covered a thousandth of the world's
landmass, cut off from the main continent since the warm­
ing of the planet and the melting of polar ice 13,000 years
before. Plundering, waterborne tribes had settled on its
coasts in waves and diffused into its downs and valleys,
where they aggregated in villages. What they knew or be­
lieved about nature depended in part on the uses of tech­
nology. They had learned to employ the power of water and
wind to crush, grind, and polish. The furnace, the forge,
and the mill had taken their place in an economy that
thereby grew more specialized and hierarchical. People in
England, as in many human communities, made metal­
kettles of copper and brass, rods and nails of iron. They
10

WHAT IMPLOYMENT IS HE FIT FOR?
made glass. These crafts and materials were prerequisites
now to a great leap in knowledge. Other prerequisites were
lenses, paper and ink, mechanical clocks, numeric systems
capable of denoting indefinitely small fractions, and postal
services spanning hundreds of miles.
By the time of Newton's birth, one great city had formed,
with about 400,000 people; no other town was even a tenth
as large. England was still a country of villages and farms, its
seasons ordered by the Christian calendar and the rhythms
of agriculture: lambing and calving, haymaking and harvest.
Years of harvest failure brought widespread starvation."
Roving laborers and vagrants made up much of the popula­
tion. But a class of artisans and merchants was coming into
its own: traders, shopkeepers, apothecaries, glaziers, carpen­
ters, and surveyors, all developing a practical, mechanical
view of knowledge." They used numbers and made tools.
The nucleus of a manufacturing economy was taking shape.
When Isaac was old enough, he walked to the village
dame school, where he learned to read and studied the
Bible and chanted arithmetic tables. He was small for his
age, lonely and abandoned. Sometimes he wished his step­
father dead, and his mother, too: in a rage he threatened to
burn their house down over them. Sometimes he wished
himself dead and knew the wish for a sin."
On bright days sunlight crept along the wall. Darkness as
well as light seemed to fall from the window-or was it from
the eye? No one knew. The sun projected slant edges, a
dynamic echo of the window frame in light and shadow,
sometimes sharp and sometimes blurred, expressing a
three-dimensional geometry of intersecting planes. The par­
ticulars were hard to visualize, though the sun was the most
11

ISAAC NEWTON
regular of heavenly objects, the one whose cycles already
defined the measures of time. Isaac scratched crude geo­
metric figures, circles with arcs inscribed, and hammered
wooden pegs into the walls and the ground to measure time
exactly, to the nearest quarter-hour." He cut sun-dials into
stone and charted the shadows cast by their gnomons. This
meant seeing time as akin to space, duration as length, the
length of an arc. He measured small distances with strings
and made a translation between inches and minutes of an
hour. He had to revise this translation methodically as the
seasons changed. Across the day the sun rose and fell;
across the year its position in the sky shifted slightly against
the fixed stars and traced a slowly twisting figure eight," a
figure invisible except to the mind's eye. Isaac grew con­
scious of this pattern long before he understood it as the
product of two oddities, the earth's elliptical orbit and a tilt
in its axis.
At Woolsthorpe anyone who cared to know the hour con­
sulted Isaac's dials." "0 God! Methinks it were a happy
life," said Shakespeare's Henry VI, "to carve out dials
quaintly, point by point, thereby to see the minutes how
they run."? Sun-dials-shadow-clocks-still told most peo­
ple the time, though at some churches the hour could be
read from mechanical clocks. At night the stars turned in
the blue vault of the sky; the moon waxed and waned and
traced its own path, much like the sun's, yet not exactly­
these great globes, ruling the seasons, lighting the day
and night, connected as if by invisible cords.tv Sun-dials
embodied practical knowledge that had been refined over
millennia. With cruder sun-dials, the hours were unequal
and varied with the seasons. Better versions achieved preci-
12

WHAT IMPLOYMENT IS HE FIT FOR?
sion and encouraged an altered sense of time itself: not
just as a recurring cycle, or a mystical quality influencing
events, but as duration, measurable, a dimension. Still, no
one could perfect or even understand sun-dials until all the
shifting pieces of a puzzle had been assembled: the shad­
ows, the rhythms, the orbits of planets, the special geometry
of the ellipse, the attraction of matter by matter. It was all
one problem.
When Isaac was ten, in 1653, Barnabas Smith died, and
Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe, bringing three new chil­
dren with her. She sent Isaac off to school, eight miles up
the Great North Road, to Grantham, a market town of a
few hundred families-now a garrison town, too. Grantham
had two inns, a church, a guild hall, an apothecary, and
two mills for grinding corn and malt. II Eight miles was too
far to walk each day; Isaac boarded with the apothecary,
William Clarke, on High Street. The boy slept in the garret
and left signs of his presence, carving his name into the
boards and drawing in charcoal on the walls: birds and
beasts, men and ships, and pure abstract circles and trian­
gles.t-
At the Kings School, one room, with strict Puritan disci­
pline, Henry Stokes, schoolmaster, taught eighty boys Latin,
theology, and some Greek and Hebrew. In most English
schools that would have been all, but Stokes added some
practical arithmetic for his prospective farmers: mostly
about measurement of areas and shapes, algorithms for sur­
veying, marking fields by the chain, calculating acres
(though the acre still varied from one county to the next, or
according to the land's richness) .13 He offered a bit more
than a farmer would need: how to inscribe regular polygons
13

ISAAC NEWTON
in a circle and compute the length of each side, as Archi­
medes had done to estimate pi. Isaac scratched Archime­
des' diagrams in the wall. He entered the lowest form at the
age of twelve, lonely, anxious, and competitive. He fought
with other boys in the churchyard; sometimes noses were
bloodied. He filled a Latin exercise book with unselfcon­
scious phrases, some copied, others invented, a grim stream
of thought: A little felloto; My poore help; Hee is paile; There is
no room for me to sit; In the top of the house-In the bottom of
hell; U7hat imployment is he fit for? U7hat is hee good for?14 He
despaired. I will make an end. I cannot but weepe. I know not
what to doe.
Barely sixty lifetimes had passed since people began to
record knowledge as symbols on stone or parchment. Eng­
land's first paper mill opened at the end of the sixteenth
century, on the Deptford River. Paper was prized, and the
written word played a small part in daily life. Most of what
people thought remained unrecorded; most of what they
recorded was hidden or lost. Yet to some it seemed a time of
information surfeit. "I hear new news every day," wrote the
vicar Robert Burton, attuned as he was-virtually living in
the Bodleian Library at Oxford-to the transmission and
storage of data:
those ordinary rumours of war, plagues, fires, inundations,
thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets, spectrums,
prodigies, apparitions, . . . and such like, which these
tempestuous times afford. . . . New books every day,
pamphlets, currantoes, stories, whole catalogues of vol-
14

WHAT IMPLOYMENT IS HE FIT FOR?
urnes of all sorts, new paradoxes, opinions, schisms, here­
sies, controversies in philosophy, religion &C."15
Burton was attempting to assemble all previous knowl­
edge into a single rambling, discursive, encyclopedic book
of his own. He made no apology for his resolute plagiarism;
or, rather, he apologized this way: "A dwarf standing on the
shoulders of a Giant may see farther than a Giant him­
self."16 He tried to make sense of rare volumes from abroad,
which proposed fantastic and contradictory schemes of the
universe-from Tycho, Galileo, Kepler, and Copernicus.
He tried to reconcile them with ancient wisdom.
Did the earth move? Copernicus had revived that notion,
"not as a truth, but a supposition." Several others agreed.
"For if the Earth be the Center of the World, stand still,
as most received opinion is," 17 and the celestial spheres
revolve around it, then the heavens must move with implau­
sible speed. This followed from measurements of the dis­
tance of sun and stars. Burton borrowed (and mangled)
some arithmetic. "A man could not ride so much ground,
going 40 miles a day, in 2,904 years, as the Firmament goes
in 24 hours; or so much in 203 years, as the said Firmament
in one minute; which seems incredible." People were look­
ing at the stars through spy-glasses; Burton himself had
seen Jupiter through a glass eight feet long and agreed with
Galileo that this wanderer had its own moons.
He was forced to consider issues of shifting viewpoint,
though there was no ready language for expressing such
conundrums: "If a man's eye were in the Firmament, he
should not at all discern that great annual motion of the
earth, but it would still appear an indivisible point." If a
15

ISAAC NEWTON
man's eye could be so far away, why not a man? Imagina­
tions ran free. "If the earth move, it is a Planet, & shines to
them in the Moon, & to the other Planetary Inhabitants, as
the Moon and they to us upon the earth."
We may likewise insert . . . there be infinite Worlds, and
infinite earths or systems, in infinite œther, ... and so, by
consequence, there are infinite habitable worlds: what hin­
ders? ... It is a difficult knot to untie.
Especially difficult because so many different authorities
threw forth so many hypotheses: our modern divines, those
heathen philosophers, heretics, schismatics, the Church
of Rome. "Our latter Mathematicians have rolled all the
stones that may be stirred: and ... fabricated new systems of
the World, out of their own Dœdalean heads."18 Many races
of men have studied the face of the sky throughout history,
Burton said, and now the day was coming when God would
reveal its hidden mysteries. Tempestuous times, indeed.
But new books every day did not find their way to rural
Lincolnshire. Newton's stepfather, Smith, had owned books,
on Christian subjects. The apothecary Clarke also owned
books. Smith even possessed blank paper, in a large com­
monplace book that he had kept for forty years. He pains­
takingly numbered the pages, inscribed theological headings
atop the first few, and otherwise left it almost entirely
empty. Some time after his death this trove of paper came
into Isaac's possession. Before that, in Grantham, with two
and a half pence his mother had given him, Isaac was able
to buy a tiny notebook, sewn sheets bound in vellum. He
asserted his ownership with an inscription: Isacus Newton
hune librum possidet.ï? Over many months he filled the
16

WHAT IMPLOYMENT IS HE FIT FOR?
pages with meticulous script, the letters and numerals
often less than one-sixteenth of an inch high. He began at
both ends and worked toward the middle. Mainly he
copied a book of secrets and magic printed in London sev­
eral years earlier: John Bate's Mysteryes of Nature and Art, a
scrap book, rambling and yet encyclopedic in its intent.
He copied instructions on drawing. "Let the thing which
you intend to draw stand before you, so the light be not hin­
dered from falling upon it." "If you express the sunn make it
riseing or setting behind some hill; but never express the
moon or starrs but up on necessity." He copied recipes for
making colors and inks and salves and powders and waters.
"A sea colour. Take privet berries when the sun entreth into
Libra, about the 13th of September, dry them in the sunn;
then bruise them & steep them." Colors fascinated him. He
catalogued several dozen, finely and pragmatically distin­
guished: purple, crimson, green, another green, a light
green, russet, a brown blue, "colours for naked pictures,"
"colours for dead corpes," charcoal black and seacoal black.
He copied techniques for melting metal (in a shell), catch­
ing birds ("set black wine for them to drink where they
come"), engraving on a flint, making pearls of chalk.
Living with Clarke, apothecary and chemist, he learned
to grind with mortar and pestle; he practiced roasting and
boiling and mixing; he formed chemicals into pellets, to
be dried in the sun. He wrote down cures, remedies, and
admonitions:
THINGS HURTFULL FOR THE EYES
Garlick Onions & Leeks Gooing too suddaine after
meals. Hot wines. Cold ayre Much blood-letting ...
dust. ffire. much weeping .
17

ISAAC NEWTON
Bate's book mixed Aristotelianism and folklore: "sun­
dry Experiments both serviceable and delightfull, which
because they are confusedly intermixed, I have entituled
them Extravagants." Isaac copied that word atop several
pages. Bate described and illustrated many forms of water­
works and fireworks, and Isaac spent hours cutting wood
with his knife, building ingenious watermills and windmills.
Grantham town was building a new mill; Isaac followed its
progress and made a model, internalizing the whirring and
pounding of the machine and the principles that govern
gears, levers, rollers and pulley wheels. In his garret he
constructed a water-clock, four feet high, from a wooden
box, with an hour hand on a painted dial. He made paper
lanterns. He crafted kites and sent them aloft at night trail­
ing lanterns ablaze-lights in the black sky to frighten the
neighbors.ê?
Bate offered knowledge as play, but with a nod to sys­
tem: "the four elements, Fier, Ayer, Water, and Earth, and
the prima Principia)" he wrote. This venerable four-part
scheme-with its corollary powers: dry, cool, warm, and
moist-expressed a desire to organize, classify, and name
the world's elements, in the absence of mathematical and
technological tools. Simple wisdom covered motion, too.
Bate explained: "Their light parts ascend upwards; and
those that are more grosse & heavy, do the contrary.">'
Isaac omitted these principles from his copying. He
crowded his tiny pages with astronomical tables related to
sun-dialing, followed by an elaborate computation of the
calendar for the next twenty-eight years. He copied lists of
words, adding as many of his own as came to mind.ê­
Across forty-two notebook pages he organized 2,400 nouns
in columns under subject headings:

Thoughts of family were no balm to this troubled soul.
Nevertheless, in the fall of 1659, when Isaac was sixteen
years old, his mother summoned him home to be a farmer.

HE DID NOT KNOW what he wanted to be or do, but it
was not tend sheep or follow the plow and the dung
cart. He spent more time gathering herbs and lying with a
book among the asphodel and moonwort, out of the house­
hold's sight.' He built waterwheels in the stream while his
sheep trampled the neighbors' barley. He watched the flow
of water, over wood and around rocks, noting the whorls
and eddies and waves, gaining a sense of fluid motion.? He
defied his mother and scolded his half-sisters." He was fined
in the manor court for allowing his swine to trespass and his
fences to lie in disrepair."
His Grantham schoolmaster, Stokes, and his mother's
brother, the rector William Ayscough, finally intervened.
Ayscough had prepared for the clergy at the College of the
Holy and Undivided Trinity, the greatest of the sixteen col­
leges at the University of Cambridge, so they arranged for
Isaac to be sent there. He made the journey south, three
days and two nights, and was admitted in June 1661. Cam­
bridge recognized students in three categories: noblemen,
who dined at high table, wore sophisticated gowns, and
received degrees with little examination; pensioners, who

paid for tuition and board and aimed, mainly, for the Angli­
can ministry; and sizars, who earned their keep by menial
service to other students, running errands, waiting on them
at meals, and eating their leftovers. The widowed Hannah
Smith was wealthy now, by the standards of the country­
side, but chose to provide her son little money; he entered
Trinity College as a subsizar. He had enough for his imme­
diate needs: a chamber pot; a notebook of 140 blank pages,
three and a half by five and a half inches, with leather
covers; "a quart bottle and ink to fill it"; candles for many
long nights, and a lock for his desk.> For a tutor he was as­
signed an indifferent scholar of Greek. Otherwise he kept
to himself.
He felt learning as a form of obsession, a worthy pursuit,
in God's service, but potentially prideful as well. He taught
himself a shorthand of esoteric symbols-this served both
to save paper and encrypt his writing-and he used it, at a
moment of spiritual crisis, to record a catalogue of his sins.
Among them were neglecting to pray) negligence at the chapel)
and variations on the theme of falling short in piety and
devotion. He rebuked himself for a dozen ways of breaching
the Sabbath. On one Sunday he had whittled a quill pen
and then lied about it. He confessed uncleane thoughts words
and actions and dreamese. He regretted, or tried to regret,
setting my heart on money learning pleasure more than Thee."
Money, learning, pleasure: three sirens calling his heart. Of
these, neither money nor pleasure came in abundance.
The Civil War had ended and so had the Protectorate
of Oliver Cromwell, dead from malaria, buried and then
exhumed so his head could be stuck on a pole atop West­
minster Hall. During the rebellion Puritan reformers had
21

ISAAC NEWTON
gained control of Cambridge and purged the colleges of
many Royalist scholars. Now, with the restoration of Charles
II to the crown, Puritans were purged, Cromwell was hanged
in effigy, and the university's records from the Protectorate
years were burned. This riverside town was a place of fer­
ment, fifty miles from London, a hundredth its size, a cross­
roads for information and commerce. Each year between
harvest and plowing, tradesmen gathered for Stourbridge
Fair, England's largest: a giant market for wool and hops,
metal-ware and glass-ware, silk and stationery, books, toys,
and musical instruments-a bedlam of languages and ap­
parel, and "an Abstract of all sorts of mankind," as a pam­
phleteer described it.? Newton, scrupulous with his limited
funds, bought books there and, one year, a glass prism-a
toy, imprecisely ground, flawed with air bubbles. Often
enough, the complex human traffic had another conse­
quence: Cambridge suffered visitations of plague.
The curriculum had grown stagnant. It followed the
scholastic tradition laid down in the university's medieval
beginnings: the study of texts from disintegrated Mediter­
ranean cultures, preserved in Christian and Islamic sanctu­
aries through a thousand years of European upheaval. The
single authority in all the realms of secular knowledge was
Aristotle-doctor's son, student of Plato, and collector of
books. Logic, ethics, and rhetoric were all his, and so-to
the extent they were studied at all-were cosmology and
mechanics. The Aristotelian canon enshrined systematiza­
tion and rigor, categories and rules. It formed an edifice
of reason: knowledge about knowledge. Supplemented by
ancient poets and medieval divines, it was a complete edu­
cation, which scarcely changed from generation to genera-
22

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
tian. Newton began by reading closely, but not finishing,
the Organon and the Nicomachean Ethics ("For the things
we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them").8
He read Aristotle through a mist of changing languages,
along with a body of commentary and disputation. The
words crossed and overlapped. Aristotle's was a world of
substances. A substance possesses qualities and properties,
which taken together amount to a form, depending ulti­
matelyon its essence. Properties can change; we call this
motion. Motion is action, change, and life. It is an indispen­
sable partner of time; the one could not exist without the
other. If we understood the cause of motion, we would
understand the cause of the world.
For Aristotle motion included pushing, pulling, carry­
ing, and twirling; combining and separating; waxing and
waning. Things in motion included a peach ripening, a fish
swimming, water warming over a fire, a child growing into
an adult, an apple falling from a tree.? The heavy thing and
the light thing move to their proper positions: the light thing
up and the heavy thing down.t? Some motion is natural;
some violent and unnatural. Both kinds revealed the con­
nections between things. "Everything that is in motion must
be moved by something," Aristotle asserted (and proved, by
knotted logic)."! A thing cannot be at once mover and moved.
This simple truth implied a first mover, put in motion by no
other, to break what must otherwise be an infinite loop:
Since everything that is in motion must be moved by
something, let us take the case in which a thing is in
locomotion and is moved by something that is itself in
23

ISAAC NEWTON
motion, ... and that by something else, and so on contin­
ually: then the series cannot go on to infinity, but there
must be some first mover.
To the Christian fathers, this first mover could only be
God. It was a testament to how far pure reason could take a
philosopher; and to how involuted and self-referential a
chain of reasoning could become, with nothing to feed on
but itself.
This all-embracing sense of motion left little place for
quantity, measurement, and number. If objects in motion
could include a piece of bronze becoming a statue;'? then
philosophers were not ready to make fine distinctions, like
the distinction between velocity and acceleration. Indeed,
the Greeks had a principled resistance to mathematiciz­
ing our corruptible, flawed, sublunary world. Geometry be­
longed to the celestial sphere; it might relate music and the
stars, but projectiles of rock or metal were inappropriate
objects for mathematical treatment. So technology, advanc­
ing, exposed Aristotelian mechanics as quaint and impo­
tent. Gunners understood that a cannonball, once in flight,
was no longer moved by anything but a ghostly memory of
the explosion inside the iron barrel; and they were learning,
roughly, to compute the trajectories of their projectiles. Pen­
dulums, in clockwork, however crude, demanded a mathe­
matical view of motion. And in turn the clockwork made
measurement possible-first hours, then minutes. Of an
object falling from a tower or rolling down an inclined
plane, people could begin to ask: what is the distance? what
is the time?
What, therefore, is the velocity? And how does the veloc­
ity, itself, change?
24

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
Nor was Aristotle's cosmology faring well outside Cam­
bridge's gates. It was harmonious and immutable: crys­
talline spheres round the earth, solid and invisible, carrying
the celestial orbs within them. Ptolemy had perfected his
universe and then, for hundreds of years, Christian astrono­
mers embraced and extended it, reconciled it with biblical
scripture, and added a heaven of heavens, deep and pure,
perhaps infinite, the home of God and angels, beyond the
sphere of fixed stars. But as stargazers made increasingly
detailed notations, they catalogued planetary motions too
irregular for concentric spheres. They saw freaks and im­
purities, such as comets glowing and vanishing. By the
1660s-new news every day-readers of esoterica knew well
enough that the earth was a planet and that the planets
orbited the sun. Newton's notes began to include measure­
ments of the apparent magnitude of stars.
Although the library of Trinity College had more than
three thousand books, students could enter only in the
company of a fellow. Still, Newton found his way to new
ideas and polemics: from the French philosopher René
Descartes, and the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who
had died in the year of Newton's birth. Descartes proposed
a geometrical and mechanical philosophy. He imagined a
universe filled throughout with invisible substance, forming
great vortices that sweep the planets and stars forward.
Galileo, meanwhile, applied geometrical thinking to the
problem of motion. Both men defied Aristotle explicitly­
Galileo by claiming that all bodies are made of the same
stuff, which is heavy, and therefore fall at the same rate.
Not the same speed, however. After long gestation,
Galileo created a concept of uniform acceleration. He con­
sidered motion as a state rather than a process. Without
25

ISAAC NEWTON
ever using a word such as inertia, he nonetheless conceived
that bodies have a tendency to remain in motion or to
remain motionless. The next step demanded experiment
and measure. He measured time with a water-clock. He
rolled balls down ramps and concluded, wrongly, that their
speed varied in proportion to the distance they rolled.
Later, trying to understand free fall, he reached the modern
definition, correctly assimilating units of distance, units of
speed, and units of time. Newton began to absorb this, at
second or third hand; Galileo had written mostly in Italian,
a language few in England could read;'?
In Newton's second year, having filled the beginning and
end of his notebook with Aristotle, he started a new section
deep inside: Questiones quœdam philosophicce-some philo­
sophical questions. He set authority aside. Later he came
back to this page and inscribed an epigraph borrowed from
Aristotle's justification for dissenting from his teacher. Aris­
totle had said, "Plato is my friend, but truth my greater
friend." Newton inserted Aristotle's name in sequence: Ami­
cus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis arnica ueritas.ï+ He made a
new beginning. He set down his knowledge of the world,
organized under elemental headings, expressed as ques­
tions, based sometimes on his reading, sometimes on spec­
ulation. It showed how little was known, altogether. The
choice of topics-forty-five in all-suggested a foundation
for a new natural philosophy.
Of the First Matter. Of Atoms. Could he know, by the force
oflogic, whether matter was continuous and infinitely divis­
ible, or discontinuous and discrete? Were its ultimate parts
26

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
mathematical points or actual atoms? Since a mathemati­
cal point lacks body or dimension-"is but an imaginary
entity" -it seemed implausible that even an infinite number
of them could combine to form matter with real extension, IS
even if bits of vacuum ("interspersed inanities") separated
the parts. The question of God's role, as creator, could be
dangerous territory. "Tis a contradiction to say the first
matter depends on some other subject" -in parentheses he
added, "except God"; then, on second thought, he crossed
that out-"since that implies some former matter on which
it must depend." Reasoning led him, as it had led ancient
Greeks, to atoms-not by observation or experiment, but
by eliminating alternatives. Newton declared himself a cor­
puscularian and an atomist. "The first matter must be
attoms. And that Matter may be so small as to be indis­
cernible." Very small, but finite, not zero. Indiscernible, but
unbreakable and indivisible. This was an unsettled concep­
tion, because Newton also saw a world of smooth change, of
curves, and of flow. What about the smallest parts of time
and motion? Were these continuous or discrete?
Quantity. Place. "Extension is related to places, as time
to days yeares &C."I6 He invoked God on another contro­
versial question: Is space finite or infinite? Not the imagi­
nary abstract space of geometers, but the real space in
which we live. Infinite, surely! "To say that extension is but
indefinite" -Descartes said this, in fact-"is as much to say
God is but indefinitely perfect because wee cannot appre­
hend his whole perfection."
Time and Eternity. No abstract disputation here; he just
sketched a wheel-shaped clock, to be driven by water or
sand, and raised wholly practical questions about making
27

ISAAC NEWTON
clocks with various materi­
als, such as "metalline globu­
lar dust." Only then did he
reach Motion, and again, he
began by looking for the root
constituents, the equivalent
of atoms. Motion led to Celes­
tiall Matter & Orbes-which
took Newton, encountering
the early echoes of Conti­
nental thought, to Descartes.
In Descartes's universe, there
could be no vacuum, for
the universe was space, and
space meant extension, and
extension surely implied sub­
stance. Also, the world's prin­
ciples were mechanical: all
action propagated through
contact, one object directly
pushing another, no mystical influences from afar.
So a vacuum could not transmit light. Light was a form
of pression, Descartes said-imaginatively, because philoso­
phers had barely begun to conceive of pressure as a quality
that an invisible fluid, the air, could possess. But now New­
ton had heard of Robert Boyle's experiments with an air­
pump, and pressure was the word Boyle used in this new
sense. Newton began again:

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
[sun] to produce light, & spend most of its motion in filling
up the chinks between the globuli.!?
From matter to motion, to light, and to the structure of
the cosmos. The sun drove the vortex by its beams. The
ubiquitous vortex could drive anything: Newton sketched
some ideas for perpetual motion machines. But light itself
played a delicate part in the Cartesian scheme, and Newton,
attempting to take Descartes literally, already sensed contra­
dictions. Pressure does not restrict itself to straight lines;
vortices whirl around corners. "Light cannot be by pres­
sion," Newton asserted, "for then wee should see in the
night a [s] wel or better than in the day we should se [e] a
bright light above us becaus we are pressed downewards .... "
Eclipses should never darken the sky. "A man goeing or
running would see in the night. When a fire or candle is
extinguished we lookeing another way should see a light."!"
Another elusive word, gravity, began to appear in the
Questiones. Its meanings darted here and there. It served as
half of a linked pair: Gravity & Levity. It represented the
tendency of a body to descend, ever downward. But how
could this happen? "The matter causing gravity must pass
through all the pores of a body. It must ascend againe, for
else the bowells of the earth must have had large cavitys &
inanitys to containe it in .... " 19 It must be crowded in that
unimaginable place, the center of the earth-all the world's
streams coming home. "When the streames meet on all
sides in the midst of the Earth they must needs be coarcted
into a narrow roome & closely press together."
Then again, perhaps an object's gravity was inherent, a
quantity to be exactly measured, even if it varied from place
29

ISAAC NEWTON
to place: "The gravity of a body in
diverse places as at the top and bot­
tom of a hill, in different latitudes
&c. may be measured by an instru-
Violent motion ment" -he sketched a balance scale.
(Newton's drawing). He speculated about "rays of grav-
ity." Then, gravity could also refer to
a body's tendency to move, not downward, but in any
direction; its tendency to remain in motion, once started. If
such a tendency existed, no language yet had a word for it.
Newton considered the problem of the cannonball, still ris­
ing, long after leaving the gun. "Violent motion is made"­
he struck the word made-"continued either by the aire or
by motion" -struck the word motion and replaced it with
force:
Violent motion is flTftà.e continued either by the aire or by
ffie1:ies force imprest or by the natural gravity in the body
moved.
Yet how could the cannonball be helped along by the air?
He noted that the air crowds more upon the front of a pro­
jectile than on the rear, "& must therefore rather hinder it."
So the continuing motion must come from some natural
tendency in the object. But-gravity?
Some of his topics-for example, Fluidity Stability Humid­
ity Siccity2°-never progressed past a heading. No matter.
He had set out his questions. Of Heate & Cold. Atraction
Magneticall. Colours. Sounds. Generation & Coruption. Mem­
ory. They formed a program, girded with measurements,
clocks and scales, experiments both practical and imagi­
nary. Its ambition encompassed the whole of nature.
30

SOME PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS
One more mystery: the Flux & Reflux of the Sea. He con­
sidered a way to test whether the moon's "pressing the
atmosphere" causes the tides. Fill a tube with mercury or
water; seal the top; "the liquor will sink three or four inches
below it leaving a vacuum (perhaps)"; then as the air is
pressed by the moon, see if the water will rise or fall. He
wondered whether the sea level rose by day and fell by
night; whether it was higher in the morning or evening.
Though fishermen and sailors around the globe had stud­
ied the tides for thousands of years, people had not amassed
enough data to settle those questions.>'

To Resolve Problems by Motion
CAMBRIDGE IN 1664 HAD for the first time in its history
a professor of mathematics, Isaac Barrow, another
former Trinity College sizar, a decade older than New­
ton. Barrow had first studied Greek and theology; then
left Cambridge, learned medicine, more theology, church
history, and astronomy, and finally turned to geometry.
Newton attended Barrow's first lectures. He was standing
for examinations that year, on his way to being elected a
scholar, and it was Barrow who examined him, mainly on
the Elements of Euclid. He had not studied it before. At
Stourbridge Fair he found a book of astrology and was
brought up short by a diagram that required an under­
standing of trigonometry I-more than any Cambridge stu­
dent was meant to know. He bought and borrowed more
books. Before long, in a few texts, he had at hand a précis of
the advanced mathematics available on the continent of
Europe. He bought Franz van Schooten's Miscellanies and
his Latin translation of Descartes's difficult masterpiece, La
Géométrie; then William Oughtred's Clavis Mathematicœ
and John Wallis's Arithmetica Infinùorum.? This reading
remained far from comprehensive. He was inventing more
than absorbing.

At the end of that year, just before the winter solstice, a
comet appeared low in the sky, its mysterious tail blazing
toward the west. Newton stayed outdoors night after night,
noting a path against the background of the fixed stars,
watching till it vanished in the light of each dawn, and only
then returned to his room, sleepless and disordered. A
comet was a frightening portent, a mutable and irregular
traveler through the firmament. Nor was that all: rumors
were reaching England of a new pestilence in Holland­
perhaps from Italy or the Levant, perhaps from Crete or
Cyprus.
Hard behind the rumors came the epidemic. Three men
in London succumbed in a single house; by January the
plague, this disease of population density, was spreading
from parish to parish, hundreds dying each week, then
thousands. Before the outbreak ran its course, in little more
than a year, it killed one of every six Londoners." Newton's
mother wrote from Woolsthorpe:

The colleges of Cambridge began shutting down. Fellows
and students dispersed into the countryside.
33

ISAAC NEWTON
Newton returned home. He built bookshelves and made
a small study for himself. He opened the nearly blank
thousand-page commonplace book he had inherited from
his stepfather and named it his Waste Book." He began fill­
ing it with reading notes. These mutated seamlessly into
original research. He set himself problems; considered them
obsessively; calculated answers, and asked new questions.
He pushed past the frontier of knowledge (though he did
not know this). The plague year was his transfiguration.v
Solitary and almost incommunicado, he became the world's
paramount mathematician.
Most of the numerical truths and methods that people
had discovered, they had forgotten and rediscovered, again
and again, in cultures far removed from one another. Math­
ematics was evergreen. One scion of Homo sapiens could
still comprehend virtually all that the species knew collec­
tively. Only recently had this form of knowledge begun to
build upon itself." Greek mathematics had almost vanished;
for centuries, only Islamic mathematicians had kept it alive,
meanwhile inventing abstract methods of problem solv­
ing called algebra. Now Europe became a special case: a re­
gion where people were using books and mail and a single
language, Latin, to span tribal divisions across hundreds
of miles; and where they were, self-consciously, receiving
communications from a culture that had flourished and
then disintegrated more than a thousand years before. The
idea of knowledge as cumulative-a ladder, or a tower of
stones, rising higher and higher-existed only as one possi­
bility among many. For several hundred years, scholars of
scholarship had considered that they might be like dwarves
seeing farther by standing on the shoulders of giants, but
34

TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
they tended to believe more in rediscovery than in progress.
Even now, when for the first time Western mathematics
surpassed what had been known in Greece, many philoso­
phers presumed they were merely uncovering ancient se­
crets, found in sunnier times and then lost or hidden.
With printed books had come a new metaphor for the
world's organization. The book was a container for infor­
mation, designed in orderly patterns, encoding the real in
symbols; so, perhaps, was nature itself. The book of nature
became a favorite conceit of philosophers and poets: God
had written; now we must read." "Philosophy is written in
this grand book--I mean the universe-which stands con­
tinually open to our gaze," said Galileo. "But the book can­
not be understood unless one first learns to comprehend
the language and read the letters in which it is composed. It
is written in the language of mathematics .... "9
But by mathematics he did not mean numbers: "Its char­
acters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures,
without which it is humanly impossible to understand a sin­
gle word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a
dark labyrinth."
The study of different languages created an awareness
of language: its arbitrariness, its changeability. As Newton
learned Latin and Greek, he experimented with shorthand
alphabets and phonetic writing, and when he entered Trin­
ity College he wrote down a scheme for a "universal"
language, based on philosophical principles, to unite the
nations of humanity. "The Dialects of each Language being
soe divers & arbitrary," he declared, "a generall Language
cannot bee so fitly deduced from them as from the natures
of things themselves." 10 He understood language as a pro-
35

ISAAC NEWTON
cess, an act of transposition or translation-the conversion
of reality into symbolic form. So was mathematics, sym­
bolic translation at its purest.
For a lonely scholar seeking his own path through tan­
gled thickets, mathematics had a particular virtue. When
Newton got answers, he could usually judge whether they
were right or wrong, no public disputation necessary. He
read Euclid carefully now. The Elements-transmitted from
ancient Alexandria via imperfect Greek copies, translated
into medieval Arabic, and translated again into Latin­
taught him the fundamental program of deducing the prop­
erties of triangles, circles, lines, and spheres from a few
given axioms. I I He absorbed Euclid's theorems for later use,
but he was inspired by the leap of Descartes's Géométrie, a
small and rambling text, the third and last appendix to his
Discours de la Méthode.s? This forever joined two great
realms of thought, geometry and algebra. Algebra Ca "bar­
barous" art, Descartes said;'> but it was his subject none­
theless) manipulated unknown quantities as if they were
known, by assigning them symbols. Symbols recorded infor­
mation, spared the memory, just as the printed book did.!"
Indeed, before texts could spread by printing, the develop­
ment of symbolism had little point.
With symbols came equations: relations between quanti­
ties, and changeable relations at that. This was new terri­
tory, and Descartes exploited it. He treated one unknown
as a spatial dimension, a line; two unknowns thus define a
plane. Line segments could now be added and even multi­
plied. Equations generated curves; curves embodied equa­
tions. Descartes opened the cage doors, freeing strange
new bestiaries of curves, far more varied than the elegant
36

ISAAC NEWTON
conic sections studied by the Greeks. Newton immediately
began expanding the possibilities, adding dimensions, gen­
eralizing, mapping one plane to another with new coordi­
nates. He taught himself to find real and complex roots of
equations and to factor expressions of many terms-poly­
nomials. When the infinite number of points in a curve cor­
respond to the infinite solutions of its equation, then all the
solutions can be seen at once, as a unity. Then equations
have not just solutions but other properties: maxima and
minima, tangents and areas. These were visualized, and
they were named.
No one understands the mental faculty we call mathemati­
cal intuition; much less, genius. People's brains do not dif­
fer much, from one to the next, but numerical facility seems
rarer, more special, than other talents. It has a threshold
quality. In no other intellectual realm does the genius find
so much common ground with the idiot savant. A mind
turning inward from the world can see numbers as lustrous
creatures; can find order in them, and magic; can know
numbers as if personally. A mathematician, too, is a poly­
glot. A powerful source of creativity is a facility in translat­
ing, seeing how the same thing can be said in seemingly
different ways. If one formulation doesn't work, try another.
Newton's patience was limitless. Truth, he said much
later, was "the offspring of silence and meditation."15
And he said: "I keep the subject constantly before me
and wait 'till the first dawnings open slowly, by little and lit­
tle, into a full and clear light."!"
Newton's Waste Book filled day by day with new research
38

TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
in this most abstract of realms. He computed obsessively. He
worked out a way to transform equations from one set of
axes to any alternative frame of reference. On one page he
drew a hyperbola and set about calculating the area under
it-"squaring" it. He stepped past the algebra Descartes
knew. He would not confine himself to expressions of a
few (or many) terms; instead he constructed infinite series:
expressions that continue forever.!? An infinite series need
not sum to infinity; rather, because the terms could grow
smaller and smaller, they could close in on a goal or limit.
He conceived such a series to square the hyperbola-
x2 x3 x4
ax--+----+ ...
2 3a 4a2
-and carried out the calculation to fifty-five decimal
places: in all, more than two thousand tiny digits marching
down a single page in orderly formation.!" To conceive of
infinite series and then learn to manipulate them was to
transform the state of mathematics. Newton seemed now to
39

ISAAC NEWTON
possess a limitless ability to generalize, to move from one or
a few particular known cases to the universe of all cases.
Mathematicians had a glimmering notion of how to raise
the sum of two quantities, a + b, to some power. Through
infinite series, Newton discovered in the winter of 1664
how to expand such sums to any power, integer or not: the
general binomial expansion.
He relished the infinite, as Descartes had not. "We
should never enter into arguments about the infinite,"
Descartes had written.
For since we are finite, it would be absurd for us to deter­
mine anything concerning the infinite; for this would be to
attempt to limit it and grasp it. So we shall not bother to
reply to those who ask if half an infinite line would itself be
infinite, or whether an infinite number is odd or even, and
so on. It seems that nobody has any business to think
about such matters unless he regards his own mind as
infinite.!?
Yet it turns out that the human mind, though bounded in a
nutshell, can discern the infinite and take its measure.
A special aspect of infinity troubled Newton; he returned
to it again and again, turning it over, restating it with new
definitions and symbols. It was the problem of the infinites­
imal-the quantity, impossible and fantastic, smaller than
any finite quantity, yet not so small as zero. The infinitesi­
mal was anathema to Euclid and Aristotle. Nor was New­
ton altogether at ease with it.20 First he thought in terms of
"indivisibles" -points which, when added to one another
infinitely, could perhaps make up a finite length.>' This
caused paradoxes of dividing by zero:

Later he added an afterthought-
(that is undetermined)
Tis indefinite /\ how greate a sphœre may be made how
greate a number may be reckoned, how far matter is divis­
ible, how much time or extension wee can fansy but all the
a
Extension that is, Eternity, - are infinite.F
o
-blurring the words indefinite and undetermined by apply­
ing them alternately to mathematical quantities and degrees
of knowledge. Descartes's reservations notwithstanding,
the infinitude of the universe was in play-the boundless­
ness of God's space and time. The infinitesimal-the almost
nothing-was another matter. It might have been simply
the inverse problem: the infinitely large and the infinitely
small. A star of finite size, if it could be seen at an infinite
distance, would appear infinitesimal. The terms in New­
ton's infinite series approached the infinitesimal. "We are
among infinities and indivisibles," Galileo said, "the former
incomprehensible to our understanding by reason of their
largeness, and the latter by their smallness."23
Newton was seeking better methods-more general-for
finding the slope of a curve at any particular point, as well
another quantity, related but once removed, the degree of
curvature, rate of bending, "the crookedness in lines." 24 He
applied himself to the tangent, the straight line that grazes
41

ISAAC NEWTON
the curve at any point, the straight line that the curve would
become at that point) if it could be seen through an infi­
nitely powerful microscope. He drew intricate construc­
tions, more complex and more free than anything in Euclid
or Descartes. Again and again he confronted the specter of
the infinitesimal: "Then (if hs & cd have an infinitely little
distance otherwise not) ... "; " ... (which operacon cannot
in this case bee understood to bee good unlesse infinite lit­
tleness may bee considered geometrically) .... "25 He could
not escape it, so he pressed it into service, employing a pri­
vate symbol-a little Q-for this quantity that was and was
not zero. In some of his diagrams, two lengths differed "but
infinitely little," while two other lengths had "no difference
at all." It was essential to preserve this uncanny distinc­
tion. It enabled him to find areas by infinitely partitioning
curves and infinitely adding the partitions. He created "a
Method whereby to square those crooked lines which may
bee squared't=-vto integrate (in the later language of the
calculus).
As algebra melded with geometry, so did a physical
counterpart, the problem of motion. Whatever else a curve
was, it naturally represented the path of a moving point.
The tangent represented the instantaneous direction of
motion. An area could be generated by a line sweeping
across the plane. To think that way was to think kinetically.
It was here that the infinitesimal took hold. Motion was
smooth, continuous, unbroken-how could it be other­
wise? Matter might reduce to indivisible atoms, but to
describe motion, mathematical points seemed more appro­
priate. A body on its way from a to b must surely pass
through every point between. There must be points between,
42

TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
no matter how close a is to b; just as between any pair of
numbers, more numbers must be found. But this contin­
uum evoked another form of paradox, as Greek philoso­
phers had seen two thousand years before: the paradox of
Achilles and the tortoise. The tortoise has a head start.
Achilles can run faster but can never catch up, because each
time he reaches the tortoise's last position, the tortoise has
managed to crawl a bit farther ahead. By this logic Zeno
proved that no moving body could ever reach any given
place-that motion itself did not exist. Only by embracing
the infinite and the infinitesimal, together, could these
paradoxes be banished. A philosopher had to find the sum
of infinitely many, increasingly small intervals. Newton
wrestled with this as a problem of words: swifter, slower;
least distance, least progression; instant, interval.
That it may be knowne how motion is swifter or slower
consider: that there is a least distance, a least progression
in motion & a least degree of time. . . . In each degree of
time wherein a thing moves there will be motion or else in
all those degrees put together there will be none: ... no
motion is done in an instant or intervall of time. 27
A culture lacking technologies of time and speed also
lacked basic concepts that a mathematician needed to
quantify motion. The English language was just beginning
to adapt its first unit of velocity: the term knot) based on the
sailor's only speed-measuring device, the log line heaved
into the sea. The science most eager to understand the
motion of earthly objects, ballistics, measured the angles
of gun barrels and the distances their balls traveled, but
43

ISAAC NEWTON
scarcely conceived of velocity; even when they could define
this quantity, as a ratio of distance and time, they could not
measure it. Galileo, when he dropped weights from towers,
could make only the crudest estimates of their velocity,
though he used an esoteric unit of time: seconds of an hour.
Newton was struck by the ambition in his exactitude:
"According to Galileo an iron ball of 100 lb. Florentine
(that is 78 lb. at London avoirdupois weight) descends 100
Florentine braces or cubits (or 49.01 Ells, perhaps 66 yds.)
in 5 seconds of an hour."28
In the autumn of 1665 he made notes on "mechanical"
lines, as distinguished from the merely geometric. Mechan­
ical curves were those generated by the motion of a point,
or by two such motions compounded: spirals, ellipses, and
cycloids. Descartes had considered the cycloid, the curve
generated by a point on a circle as the circle rolls along
a line. He regarded this oddity as suspect and unmathe­
matical, because it could not (before the calculus) be de­
scribed analytically. But such artifacts from the new realm
of mechanics kept intruding on mathematics. Hanging
cables or sails in the wind traced mechanical curves.ê? If a
cycloid was mechanical, it was nevertheless an abstraction:
a creature of several motions, or rates, summed in a certain
way. Indeed, Newton now saw ellipses in different lights­
geometrical and analytical. The ellipse was the effect of a
quadratic formula. Or it was the closed line drawn in the
dirt by the "gardener's" construction, in which a loose cord
is tied to two pegs in the ground: "keeping it so stretched
out draw the point b about & it shall describe the Ellipsis."30
Or it was a circle with extra freedom; a circle with one con­
straint removed; a squashed circle, its center bifurcating
44

TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
into a pair of foci. He devised procedures for drawing tan­
gents to mechanical curves, thus measuring their slopes;
and, in November, proposed a method for deducing, from
two or more such lines, the corresponding relation between
the velocities of two or more moving bodies.>!
He found tangents by computing the relationship be­
tween points on a curve separated by an infinitesimal dis­
tance. In the computation, the points almost merge into
one, "conjoyne, which will happen when be = 0, vanisheth
into nothing."32 That 0 was an artifice, a gadget for the
infinitesimal, as an arbitrarily small increment or a moment
of time. He showed how the terms with 0 "may be ever blot­
ted out."33 Extending his methods, he also quantified rates
of bending, by finding centers of curvature and radii of cur­
vature.
A geometrical task matched a kinetic task: to measure
curvature was to find a rate of change. Rate of change was
itself an abstraction of an abstraction; what velocity was to
position, acceleration was to velocity. It was differentiation
(in the later language of the calculus). Newton saw this sys­
tem whole: that problems of tangents were the inverse of
problems of quadrature; that differentiation and integration
are the same act, inverted. The procedures seem alien, one
from the other, but what one does, the other undoes. That
is the fundamental theorem of the calculus, the piece of
mathematics that became essential knowledge for building
engines and measuring dynamics. Time and space-joined.
Speed and area-two abstractions, seemingly disjoint, re­
vealed as cognate.
Repeatedly he started a new page-in November 1665,
in May 1666, and in October 1666-in order to essay a
45

ISAAC NEWTON
system of propositions needed "to resolve Problems by mo­
tion. "34 On his last attempt he produced a tract of twenty­
four pages, on eight sheets of paper folded and stitched
together. He considered points moving toward the centers
of circles; points moving parallel to one another; points
moving "angularly" or "circularly"-this language was
unsettled-and points moving along lines that intersected
planes. A variable representing time underlay his equa­
tions-time as an absolute background for motion. When
velocity changed, he imagined it changing smoothly and
continuously-across infinitesimal moments, represented
by that o. He issued himself instructions:
Set all the termes on one side of the Equation that they
become equall to nothing. And first multiply each terme
by so many times P_ as x hath dimensions in the terme.
x
Secondly multiply each term by so many times !l_ ... & if
y
there bee still more unknowne quantitys doe like to every
unknowne quantity.'>
Time was a flowing thing. In terms of velocity, position
was a function of time. But in terms of acceleration, velocity
was itself a function of time. Newton made up his own
notation, with combinations of superscript dots, and vocab­
ulary, calling these functions "fluents" and "fluxions": flow­
ing quantities and rates of change. He wrote it all several
times but never quite finished.
In creating this mathematics Newton embraced a para­
dox. He believed in a discrete universe. He believed in
atoms, small but ultimately indivisible-not infinitesimal.
Yet he built a mathematical framework that was not discrete
46

TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
but continuous, based on a geometry of lines and smoothly
changing curves. "All is flux, nothing stays still," Heracli­
tus had said two millennia before. "Nothing endures but
change." But this state of being-in flow) in change-defied
mathematics then and afterward. Philosophers could barely
observe continuous change, much less classify it and gauge
it, until now. It was nature's destiny now to be mathema­
tized. Henceforth space would have dimension and meas­
ure; motion would be subject to geometry."
Far away across the country multitudes were dying in fire
and plague. Numerologists had warned that 1666 would be
the Year of the Beast. Most of London lay in black ruins:
fire had begun in a bakery, spread in the dry wind across
thatch-roofed houses, and blazed out of control for four
days and four nights. The new king, Charles II-having sur­
vived his father's beheading and his own fugitive years, and
having outlasted the Lord Protector, Cromwell-fled Lon­
don with his court. Here at Woolsthorpe the night was
strewn with stars, the moon cast its light through the apple
trees, and the day's sun and shadows carved their familiar
pathways across the wall. Newton understood now: the
projection of curves onto flat planes; the angles in three
dimensions, changing slightly each day. He saw an orderly
landscape. Its inhabitants were not static objects; they were
patterns, process and change.
What he wrote, he wrote for himself alone. He had no
reason to tell anyone. He was twenty-four and he had made
tools.

Two Great Orbs
HISTORIANS CAME TO SEE Newton as an end-point: the
"culmination" and "climax" of an episode in human
affairs conventionally called the Scientific Revolution. Then
that term began to require apologies or ironic quotation
marks;' Ambivalence is appropriate, when one speaks of the
turning point in the development of human culture, the
time when reason triumphed over unreason. The Scientific
Revolution is a story, a narrative frame laid down with hind­
sight. Yet it exists and existed, not just in the backward
vision of historians but in a self-consciousness among a
small number of people in England and Europe in the
seventeenth century. They were, as they thought, virtuosi.
They saw something new in the domain of knowledge; they
tried to express the newness; they invented academies and
societies and opened channels of communication to pro­
mote their break with the past, their new science.
We call the Scientific Revolution an epidemic, spreading
across the continent of Europe during two centuries: "It
would come to rest in England, in the person of Isaac N ew­
ton," said the physicist David Goodstein. "On the way
north, however, it stopped briefly in France .... "2 Or a
48

TWO GREAT ORBS
relay race, run by a team of heroes who passed the baton
from one to the next: COPERNICUS to KEPLER to GALILEO
to NEWTON. Or the overthrow and destruction of the Aris­
totelian cosmology: a worldview that staggered under the
assaults of Galileo and Descartes and finally expired in
1687, when Newton published a book."
For so long the earth had seemed the center of all things.
The constellations turned round in their regular proces­
sion. Just a few bright objects caused a puzzle-the planets,
wanderers, like gods or messengers, moving irregularly
against the fixed backdrop of stars. In 1543, just before his
death, Nicolaus Copernicus, Polish astronomer, astrologer,
and mathematician, published the great book De Revolu­
tionibus Orbium Coelestium ("On the Revolutions of the
Heavenly Spheres"). In it he gave order to the planets'
paths, resolving them into perfect circles; he set the earth in
motion and placed an immobile sun at the center of the
universe.!
Johannes Kepler, looking for more order in a growing
thicket of data, thousands of painstakingly recorded obser­
vations, declared that the planets could not be moving in cir­
cles. He suspected the special curves known to the ancients
as ellipses. Having thus overthrown one kind of celestial per­
fection, he sought new kinds, believing fervently in a uni­
verse built on geometrical harmony. He found an elegant
link between geometry and motion by asserting that an
imaginary line from a planet to the sun sweeps across equal
areas in equal times."
Galileo Galilei took spy-glasses-made by inserting spec­
tacle makers' lenses into a hollow tube-and pointed them
upward toward the night sky. What he saw both inspired and
49

ISAAC NEWTON
disturbed him: moons orbiting Jupiter; spots marring the
sun's flawless face; stars that had never been seen-"in
numbers ten times exceeding the old and familiar stars.">
He learned, "with all the certainty of sense evidence," that
the moon "is not robed in a smooth polished surface but is
in fact rough and uneven." It has mountains, valleys, and
chasms. (He also thought he had detected an atmosphere of
dense and luminous vapors.)
He took pains to detail an unfamiliar fact of arithmetic:
that, because in his spy-glass the moon's diameter appeared
thirty times larger, its apparent area was magnified by 900
and its apparent volume by 27,000-a square law and a
cube law. This was essentially the only mathematics in his
report, The Starry Messenger,'
It was strange to think of these dots of light as worlds,
and more strange to think of a world-the whole world-as
a body in motion, comparable to a mere stone. Yet without
understanding motion, no one could place the heavenly
bodies. There could be no cosmology without dynamics.
Galileo felt this. What he saw in the skies of Florence in
1610, English pamphleteers tried to convey a generation
later. In London a young chaplain, John Wilkins, began
writing anonymous screeds. First, in 1638, The Discovery of
a New World)' or) a Discourse tending to prove) that it is probable
there may be another habitable World in the Moon."
Among all the celestial mysteries, the moon was spe­
cial-so near, so changeling, so portentous. It stirred mad­
ness in weak minds; people were known to grow lunatic on
a monthly cycle. Empedocles saw the moon as "a globe of
pure congealed air, like hail inclosed in a sphere of fire."
Aristotle held it to be solid and opaque, whereas Julius Cae-
50

TWO GREAT ORBS
sar said it must be transparent and pure, of the same
essence as the heavens. Plain observation, night after night,
failed to settle such matters. "You may as soon persuade
some country peasants that the moon is made of green
cheese (as we say) as that it is bigger than his cart-wheel,"
wrote Wilkins, "since both seem equally to contradict his
sight, and he has not reason enough to lead him farther
than his senses."?
How far could reason lead, without help? Francis Bacon,
who had practiced logic and disputation as the king's
Learned Counsel and Attorney-General, lamented a natu­
ral philosophy built solely on words, ostentation, the elabo­
rate knitting together of established ideas.
All the philosophy of nature which is now received, is
either the philosophy of the Grecians, or that other of the
alchemists .... The one is gathered out of a few vulgar
observations, and the other out of a few experiments of a
furnace. The one never faileth to multiply words, and the
other ever faileth to multiply gold.'?
He argued for experiment-the devising of "Crucial In­
stances" to divide the true from the false. Was the moon
flame-like and airy or solid and dense? Since the moon
reflects the sun's light, Bacon proposed, a crucial instance
would be a demonstration that a flame or other rare body
does or does not reflect light. Perhaps the moon also "raises
the waters," Bacon suggested, and "makes moist things
swell." He proposed to call this effect Magnetic Motion.i!
Wilkins cited the lunar observations of many authorities:
Herodotus, the venerable Bede, the Romish divines, the
51

ISAAC NEWTON
Stoics, Moses, and Thomas Aquinas. But at last he chose a
new witness.
I shall most insist on the observation of Galilœus, the
inventor of that famous perspective, whereby we may dis­
cern the heavens hard by us; whereby those things which
others have formerly guessed at, are manifested to the eye,
and plainly discovered beyond exception or doubt.F
With his glass, Galileo could see plainly at a distance of six­
teen miles what the naked eye could scarcely see at a mile
and a half. He saw mountains and valleys; he saw a sphere
of thick vaporous air; from these it was but a short step to
infer wind and rain, seasons and weather, and so, Wilkins
concluded, inhabitants. "Of what kind they are, is uncer­
tain," he conceded. "But I think that future ages will dis­
cover more; and our posterity, perhaps, may invent some
means for our better acquaintance with these inhabitants."
As soon as the art of flying is discovered, he said, we should
manage to transplant colonies to that other world. After all,
time is the father of truth; ages passed before men crossed
the seas and found other men at the far side of the world;
surely other excellent mysteries remain to be discovered.
Wilkins urged that the strangeness of his opinions should
be no reason to reject them. The surprising discovery of
another New World weighed heavily: "How did the incred­
ulous gaze at Columbus, when he promised to discover
another part of the earth?"
Still, he agreed that the idea of multiple worlds brought
paradoxical difficulties. The most troublesome was the ten­
dency of heavy bodies to fall down: their gravity. "What a
52

TWO GREAT ORBS
huddling and confusion must there be, if there were two
places for gravity and two places for lightness?" 13 Which
way should bodies of that other world fall? To where should
its air and fire ascend? Can we expect pieces of the moon to
fall to earth?
He answered these questions in the terms of Copernicus
and Kepler: by proposing that two worlds must have two
centers of gravity. "There is no more danger of their fall­
ing into our world, than there is fear of our falling into
the moon." He reminded his readers of the simple nature
of gravity: "nothing else, but such a quality as causes a
propension in its subject to tend downwards towards its
own centre."!"
The discovery of new worlds had lit a fuse leading to the
destruction of the Aristotelian conception of gravity. It was
inevitable. A multitude of worlds implied a multitude of ref­
erence frames. Up and down became relative terms, in the
imaginations of philosophers, contrary to common experi­
ence. Wilkins did not shrink from considering the problem
of what would happen to an object-a bullet, perhaps-sent
to such a great height that it might depart "that magnetical
globe to which it did belong." It might just come to rest, he
decided. Outside the earth's sphere of influence, pieces of
earth should lose their gravity, or their susceptibility to
gravity. He offered a "similitude":
As any light body (suppose the sun) does send forth its
beams in an orbicular form; so likewise any magnetical
body, for instance a round loadstone, does cast abroad his
magnetical vigour in a sphere .... Any other body that
is like affected coming within this sphere will presently
53

ISAAC NEWTON
descend towards the centre of it, and in that respect may
be styled heavy. But place it without this sphere, and then
the desire of union ceaseth, and so consequently the
motion also. IS
Newton read Wilkins as a boy in Grantham, at the
apothecary Clarke's.!" Whatever else he thought about the
moon, he knew it was a great planetary object traveling
through space at high speed. The mystery was why. Carried
along, as Descartes said, in a vortex? Newton knew how big
the moon was and how far away. By virtue of a coincidence,
the moon's apparent size was almost exactly the same as the
sun's, about one-half degree of arc, the coincidence that
makes a solar eclipse such a perfect spectacle. It was neces­
sary now to forge mental links across many orders of mag­
nitude in scale: between the everyday and the unimaginably
vast. Sitting in the orchard behind his farmhouse, musing
continually on geometry, Newton could see other globes,
dangling from their stems. A two-inch apple at a distance of
twenty feet subtended the same half-degree in the sky. These
ratios were second nature now, the congruent Euclidean tri­
angles inscribed in his mind's eye. When he thought about
the magnitude of these bodies, another automatic part of the
picture was an inverse square law: something varies as l/x2•
A disk twice as far away would seem not one-half as bright
but one-fourth.
Newton was eager, as the Greeks had not been, to extend
the harmony and abstraction of mathematics to the crude
sublunary world in which he lived. An apple was no sphere,
but he understood it to be flying through space along with
the rest of the earth's contents, spinning across 25,000
54

TWO GREAT ORBS
miles each day. Why, then, did it hang gently downward,
instead of being flung outward like a stone whirled around
on a string? The same question applied to the moon: what
pushed it or pulled it away from a straight path?
Many years later Newton told at least four people that he
had been inspired by an apple in his Woolsthorpe garden­
perhaps an apple actually falling from a tree, perhaps not.
He never wrote of an apple. He recalled only:
I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the
Moon ...
-gravity as a force, then, with an extended field of influ­
ence; no cutoff or boundary-
& computed the force requisite to keep the Moon in her
Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth ...
& found them answer pretty nearly. All this was in the two
plague years of 1665-1666. For in those days I was in the
prime of my age for invention & minded Mathematicks
and Philosophy more than at any time since.!?
Voltaire did mention the apple, as did other memoir­
ists, and their second- and third-hand accounts gradually
formed the single most enduring legend in the annals of
scientific discovery.tf And the most misunderstood: New­
ton did not need an apple to remind him that objects fell
to earth. Galileo had not only seen objects fall but had
dropped them from towers and rolled them down ramps.
He had grasped their acceleration and struggled to measure
it. But most emphatically he declined to explain it. "The
55

ISAAC NEWTON
present does not seem to be the proper time to investigate
the cause of the acceleration," Galileo wrote, ". . . [but]
merely to investigate and to demonstrate some of the prop­
erties of accelerated motion (whatever the cause of this
acceleration may be)."19
Nor did Newton comprehend universal gravitation in a
flash of insight. In 1666 he was barely beginning to under­
stand. What he suspected about gravity he kept private for
decades to come.
The apple was nothing in itself. It was half of a couple­
the moon's impish twin. As an apple falls toward the earth,
so does the moon: falling away from a straight line, falling
around the earth. Apple and moon were a coincidence, a
generalization, a leap across scales, from close to far and
from ordinary to immense. In his study and in his garden,
in his state of incessant lonely contemplation, his mind alive
with new modes of geometry and analysis, Newton made
connections between distant realms of thought. Still, he was
unsure. His computations were ambiguous; he only found
them answer pretty nearly. He was attempting rare exacti­
tude, more than any available raw data could support. Even
the units of measure were too crude and variable. He took
the mile to be 5,000 feet.>' He set one degree of the earth's
latitude at the equator equal to sixty miles, an error of about
15 percent. Some units were English, some antique Latin,
others Italian: mile, passus, brace, pedes. He came up with
a datum for the speed of the revolving earth: 16,500,000
cubits in six hours.>' He struggled to arrive at a datum for
the rate of fall due to gravity. He had Galileo's calculations,
in a new translation: one hundred cubits in five seconds.F
He tried to derive his own measurements using a weight
56

TWO GREAT ORBS
hanging on a cord and swinging in circles-a conical pen­
dulum. This needed patience. He noted the pendulum
making 1,512 "ticks" in an hour.P He arrived at a constant
for gravity more than double Galileo's. He concluded that a
body on the earth's surface is drawn downward by gravity
350 times stronger than the tendency of the earth's rotation
to fling it outward.
To make the arithmetic work at all, he had to suppose
that the power of attraction diminished rapidly according to
distance from the center of the earth. Galileo had said that
bodies fall with constant acceleration, no matter how far
they are from the earth; Newton sensed that this must be
wrong. And it would not be enough for gravity to fade in
proportion to distance. He estimated that the earth attracted
an apple 4,000 times as powerfully as it attracted the distant
moon. If the ratio-like brightness, and like apparent area­
depended on the square of distance, that might answer pretty
nearly.>'
He reckoned the distance of the moon at sixty times the
earth's radius; if the moon were sixty times farther than
the surface of the earth from the center of the earth, then
the earth's gravity might be 3,600 times weaker there. He
also derived this inverse-square law by an inspired argument
from an observation of Kepler's: the time a planet takes to
make one orbit grows as the 3/2 power of its distance from
the sun.ê> Yet, with the data he had, he could not quite make
the numbers work. He still found it necessary to attribute
some of the moon's motion to the vortices of Descartes.
He needed new principles of motion and force. He had
tried some out in the Questiones, and now, in the plague
year, he tried again. He wrote "axioms" in the Waste Book:
57

ISAAC NEWTON
1. If a quantity once move it will never rest unlesse hin­
dered by some externall caus.
2. A quantity will always move on in the same streight
line (not changing the determination nor celerity of its
motion) unless some externall cause divert it.>
Thus circular motion-orbital motion-demanded explana­
tion. So far, the external cause was missing from the picture.
And Newton posed himself a challenge: it ought to be pos­
sible to quantify this cause.
3. There is exactly so much required so much and noe
more force to reduce a body to rest as there was to put it
upon motion.
He continued through dozens more axioms, compnsmg
a logical whole, but a tangled one. He was hampered by
the chaos of language-words still vaguely defined and
words not quite existing. He conceived of force as a thing to
be measured-but in what units? Was force inherent in
bodies, as Descartes thought? Or was force an external
agent, impinging on bodies and changing a differently
named quantity: quantity of motion; or quantity of mutation in
its state-t; or whole motion; or force of motion? Whatever this
missing concept was, it differed from velocity and direction.
Axiom 100:
A body once moved will always keepe the same celerity,
quantity and determination of its motion.ê"
At twenty-four, Newton believed he could marshal a
complete science of motion, if only he could find the appro-
58

TWO GREAT ORBS
priate lexicon, if only he could set words in the correct
order. Writing mathematics, he could invent his own sym­
bols and form them into a mosaic. Writing in English, he
was constrained by the language at hand.ê? At times his
frustration was palpable in the stream of words. Axiom 103:
... as the body Ca) is to the body Ch) so must the power or
efficacy vigor strength or virtue of the cause which begets
the same quantity of velocity .... 30
Power efficacy vigor strength virtue-something was missing.
But these were the laws of motion, in utero.

Bodys & Senses
HE WAS LOOKING inward as well as outward. Introspec­
tion told him that his imagination could see things as
they really were. "Phantasie is helped," he noted, "by good
aire fasting moderate wine." But it is also "spoiled by drunke­
nesse, Gluttony, too much study." He added: from too much
study, and from extreme passion, "cometh madnesse."!
He wished to understand light itself-but did light's
essence lie outside or within the soul of the observer? In all
the blooming perplexity of new philosophy, little was as
muddled as the boundary between the perceived and the
perceiver. Surely the mind, composed of pure thought,
must have a point of contact with the body-at the pineal
gland, Descartes proposed. The poet Andrew Marvell,
graduate of Trinity College and now Member of Parliament
for Hull, imagined the body and soul as enslaved, each by
the other: "A soul hung up, as 'twere, in chains of nerves
and arteries and veins."? For Aristotle optics had been first
a science not of light but of sight.
N ewton, in his Questiones, had pondered the difficulty of
understanding the senses, when those very senses were em­
ployed as the agents of understanding.
60

BODYS & SENSES
The nature of things is more securely & naturally deduced
from their operations out upon another than upon our
senses. And when by the former experiments we have
found the nature of bodys, by the latter we may more
clearely find the nature of our senses. But so long as we are
ignorant of the nature of both soul and body we cannot
clearly distinguish how far an act of sensation proceeds
from the soul and how far from the body.>
With this paradox in mind, Newton, experimental philoso­
pher, slid a bodkin into his eye socket between eyeball and
bone. He pressed with the tip until he saw "severall white
darke & coloured circles .... Which circles were plainest
when I continued to rub my eye with the point of the bod­
kin." Yet when he held both eye and bodkin still, the circles
would begin to fade." Was light a manifestation of pressure,
then?

bear. He sensed that color-perhaps more than :� s(pJr .'�

depends on "imagination and

looked away at a dark wall
and saw circles of color.
There was a "motion of spir­
its" in his eye. These slowly
decayed and finally vanished.
Were they real or phantasm? Could
such colors ever be real) like the colors he
had learned to make from crushed berries or

ISAAC NEWTON
sheep's blood? After looking at the sun, he seemed to
perceive light objects as red and dark objects as blue.
Strangely, he found that he could reproduce these effects,
with practice, by pure, willful thought. "As often as I went
into the dark & intended my mind upon them as when a
man looks earnestly to see any thing which is difficult to be
seen, I could make the phantasm return without looking
any more upon the sun."> He repeated the experiment until
he began to fear permanent damage and shut himself up in
a dark room. He remained there for three days; only then
did his sight begin to clear.
Experiment-observation-science: these modern words
were impressing themselves upon him. He read them in a
new book from London, titled Micrographia: "The Science
of Nature has been already too long made only a work of
the Brain and the Fancy. It is now high time that it should
return to the plainness and soundness of Observations on
material and obvious things."? The author was Robert
Hooke, a brilliant and ambitious man seven years Newton's
senior, who wielded the microscope just as Galileo had the
telescope. These were the instruments that penetrated
the barrier of scale and opened a view into the countries of
the very large and the very small. Wonders were revealed
there. The old world-the world of ordinary scales-shrank
into its place in a continuum, one order among many. Like
Galileo, Hooke made meticulous drawings of strange new
sights and popularized his instrument as a curiosity for
wealthy aristocrats-though, after they bought the device
from the lens shop in London where he sometimes worked,
they rarely succeeded in seeing anything but vague shad­
ows. Hooke was Newton's inspiration now (though Newton
62

BODYS & SENSES
never acknowledged that). He became Newton's goad,
nemesis, tormentor, and victim.
Hooke had a unique post. He was employed, if seldom
actually paid, as Curator of Experiments to a small group of
men who formed, in 1662, what they called the Royal Soci­
ety of London. They meant to be a new sort of institution: a
national society dedicated to promoting-and especially
"communicating"-what they called "the New Philosophy"
or "Experimental Philosophy."8 Amazing discoveries war­
ranted this banner: comets and new stars; the circulation of
the blood; the grinding of glasses for telescopes; the possi­
bility of vacuities (and nature's abhorrence thereof); the
descent of heavy bodies; and diverse other things."
Nullius in verba was the Royal Society's motto. Don't take
anyone's word for it.!? These gentlemen had begged for and
received the king's patronage, but patronage meant good
will only; the society collected from its members a shilling
at a time and strained to find meeting places. Among the
founders was John Wilkins, author of The Discovery of a
New WOrld a generation before. If one man was their muse,
he was the late Francis Bacon, who had written:
We must ... completely resolve and separate Nature, not
by fire, certainly, but by the mind, which is a kind of divine
fire .... There will remain, all volatile opinions vanishing
into smoke, the affirmative form, solid, true and weIl­
defined. Now this is quickly said, but it is only reached
after many twists and turns. II
The twists and turns became the responsibility of the
Curator of Experiments, Hooke, technician and impresa-
63

ISAAC NEWTON
rio. He demonstrated experiments with air-pumps. At one
meeting he cut open the thorax and belly of a living dog,
observed its beating heart, and used a bellows to inflate its
lungs in an experiment on respiration, which he later feIt
reluctant to repeat "because of the torture of the crea­
ture."!" Another meeting dazzled and confused the Duchess
of Newcastle with colors, magnets, microscopes, roasted
mutton, and blood.t ' This was all science, a new spirit and
almost a method: persuasion from practical experience, and
formalized recording of data. Hooke lacked mathematics
but not ingenuity. He invented or improved barometers,
thermometers, and wind gauges, and he tracked London
weather obsessively.r'
In Micrographia he displayed the "new visible world" to
be seen though the instrument he described as an artificial
organ. "By the help of Microscopes, there is nothing so
small, as to escape our inquiry," he declared. IS As a geome­
ter begins with a mathematical point, he examined the
point of a needle-perfectly sharp, yet under the micro­
scope, blunt and irregular. By analogy he suggested that
the earth itself, seen from a great enough distance, would
shrink to a scarcely visible speck. More specks were to be
found in printed books: he proceeded to study and draw the
mark of a full stop, the punctuation mark-again surpris­
ingly rough and irregular, "like a great splatch of London
dirt." 16 He found wonderment in the edge of a razor and
the weft of fine linen. He discovered shifting, iridescent col­
ors in thin flakes of glass. He knew that Descartes had seen
a rainbow of colors in light passed through a prism or a
water drop, and he compared microscopic rainbows.
And here he made his book something more than a reg-
64

BODYS & SENSES
istry and gazetteer for his new world. He notified readers
that he offered a theory-a complete and methodical expla­
nation of light and color. Aristotle had thought of color as a
commingling of black and white. His followers considered
colors fundamental qualities of matter, carried by light into
the eye. Descartes had speculated that color came from
globules of light changing speed when refracted by glass or
water. Hooke disputed this and, grandly invoking the shade
of Bacon, turned to experiment: an "Experimentum Crucis)
serving as Guide or Land-mark." 17 True, Hooke observed,
a prism produces colors when refracting light. But he as­
serted that refraction was not necessary. His landmark was
the production of color in transparent substances: 18 "for
we find, that the Light in the open Air, either in or out of
the Sun-beams, and within a Room, either from one or
many Windows, produces much the same effect."
Light is born of motion, he argued. "That all kind cî fiery
burning Bodies have their parts in motion, I think will be
very easily granted me." Sensing more than he could truly
see, he asserted that all luminous bodies are in motion, per­
haps vibrating: sparks, rotting wood, and fish. Further, he
observed, or thought he observed, that two colors were fun­
damental: blue and red. They were caused by "an impres­
sion on the retina of an oblique and confus'd pulse of
light."!" Where red and blue "meet and cross each other,"
the imperfection generated "all kinds of greens." And here
his theory ended. "It would be somewhat too long a work
for this place zetetically to examine, and positively to prove,
what particular kind of motion it is .... It would be too
long, I say, here to insert the discursive progress by which I
inquir'd after the properties of the motion of Light .... "20
65

ISAAC NEWTON
Yet all in all he claimed to have explained everything; to
have given- "newly" given-the causes
capable of explicating all the Phenomena of colours, not
onely of those appearing in the Prisme, Water-drop, or
Rainbow ... but of all that are in the world, whether they
be fluid or solid bodies, whether in thick or thin, whether
transparent, or seemingly opacous.">'
Newton absorbed this bold claim.ê- He had no micro­
scope and no chance of obtaining one. For that matter, he
had no room with more than one window. He did have
a prism. He darkened his study and made a hole in the
window shutter to let in a sunbeam, white light, the purest
light, light with no intrinsic color, philosophers still thought.
He performed his own experiments-even, he felt, an exper­
imentum crucis. He noted the results and told no one.
Bacon had also warned: "God forbid that we should give
out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the
world."23
The plague abating, Newton returned to Cambridge,
where among those he did not tell of his experiments was
the professor of mathematics, Isaac Barrow.

The Oddest If Not the Most
Considerable Detection
NEwTON'S STATUS AT TRINITY improved. In October
1667 the college elected fellows for the first time in
three years: men entitled to wages (two pounds a year), a
room, continuing membership in the academic community,
and the use of the library. Each new fellow swore: "I will
embrace the true religion of Christ with all my soul. ... I
will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will
take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes
arrives, or I will resign from the college."! Chastity was
expected and marriage forbidden. Newton bought shoes
and cloth for the gown of a bachelor of arts. Besides his
stipend he received small sums from his mother and (very
rarely) from pupils he tutored. He bought a set of old books
on alchemy, along with glasses, a tin furnace, and chemi­
cals: aqua fortis, sublimate, vinegar, white lead, salt of tar­
tar.? With these he embarked on a program of research
more secret than ever.
But he also continued his mathematical investigations,
and he shared some of these with Barrow. He began to
list cubic equations: curves in three dimensions, more vari­
ous and complex than the ellipses and hyperbolas of two-
67

ISAAC NEWTON
dimensional mathematics. He attacked this subject as a
classifier, trying to sort all such curves into species and sub­
species." As he had done with the calculus, he approached
this analytic geometry from two directions at once: from the
perspective of algebra, where cubic equations begin with
the form x3 + ax: + bx + c = 0; and from a kinematic
perspective, describing these creatures in terms of their
construction, as the results of points and curves moving
through space. He plotted in his notebooks fifty-eight dis­
tinct species of cubics. He sought ever greater generality.
Barrow showed him a new book from London, Logarith­
motechnia, by Nicholas Mercator, a mathematics tutor and
member of the Royal Society. It presented a method of cal­
culating logarithms from infinite series and thus gave New­
ton a shock: his own discoveries, rediscovered. Mercator
had constructed an entire book-a useful book, at that­
from a few infinite series. For Newton these were merely
special cases of the powerful approach to infinite series he
had worked out at Woolsthorpe. Provoked, he revealed to
Barrow a bit more of what he knew. He drafted a paper in
Latin, "On Analysis by Infinite Series." He also let Barrow
post this to another Royal Society colleague, a mathemati­
cian, John Collins," but he insisted on anonymity. Only
after Collins responded enthusiastically did he let Barrow
identify him: "I am glad my friends paper giveth you so
much satisfaction. his name is Mr Newton; a fellow of our
College, & very young ... but of an extraordinary genius
and proficiency in these things."> It was the first transmis­
sion of Newton's name south of Cambridge.
At long distance, in messages separated by days or by
months, Newton and Collins now engaged in a dance.
68

THE ODDEST IF NOT THE MOST CONSIDERABLE DETECTION
Newton teased Collins with tantalizing fragments of mathe­
matical insight. Collins begged for more. Newton delayed
and withdrew. A table resolving equations of three dimen­
sions was "pretty easy and obvious enough," he declared.
"But I cannot perswade my selfe to undertake the drudgery
of making it."> Collins bruited some of Newton's handi­
work to several other mathematicians, in Scotland, France,
and Italy. He sent books to Newton and posed questions:
for example, how to calculate the rate of interest on an
annuity. Newton sent a formula for that but insisted that
his name be withheld if Collins published it: "For I see
not what there is desirable in publick esteeme, were I able
to acquire & maintaine it. It would perhaps increase my
acquaintance, the thing which I cheifiy study to decline."?
Nonetheless his name was being whispered. James Gregory,
the Scots mathematician, heard it. He was struggling with
an unsolved problem of analytic geometry that he read in
new lectures by Barrow. "I despaire of it my self, and ther­
for I doe humblie desire it of any els who can resolve it,"
he wrote Collins. "I long to see that peece of Mr Newton
which is generallie applied to al curvs.?"
When Barrow prepared his lectures for publication,
he asked Newton to help him edit the manuscripts, particu­
larly his Optical Lectures. 9 These appeared in 1669, with Bar­
row's effusive acknowledgment of "a Man of great Learning
and Sagacity, who revised my Copy and noted such things
as wanted correction." Yet Newton knew what Barrow did
not: that the whole project wanted correction. Barrow im­
agined that color had something to do with compression
and rarification and excitation of light; that red might be
"broken and interrupted by shadowy interstices" while blue
69

ISAAC NEWTON
involved "white and black particles arranged alternately."IO
Barrow's protégé had already done private research that
rendered these optics obsolete. Anyway, Barrow had ambi­
tions elsewhere. He was a favorite of the king, hoped for
advancement, and thought of himself more as a theologian
than a mathematician. Before the end of the year, he re­
signed his post as Lucasian professor, yielding it to Newton,
twenty-seven years old. I I
The young professor gained relative security. He could
be removed only for serious crime; the statutes specified
fornication, heresy, and voluntary manslaughter.t- He was
expected to read a lecture on mathematics (broadly con­
strued) each week during the academic term and deposit a
copy in the university library. But he disregarded this obli­
gation far more than he fulfilled it. When he did lecture,
students were scarce. Sometimes he read to a bare room or
gave up and walked back to his chambers.t> The existence
of this new professorship reflected a sense that mathematics
was an art useful to the growing nation-its architects,
tradesmen, and sailors-but cubic curves and infinite series
had no use in a trade or on a ship. Such mysteries were
as recondite as the researches Newton was beginning to un­
dertake alone in his chambers with his tin crucible.
Instead of mathematics he chose to lecture on light and
color. The invention of telescopes had spurred intense inter­
est in the properties of light, he noted, yet the geometers had
"hitherto erred." So he proposed to add his own discoveries
"to what my reverend predecessor last delivered from this
Place."14 He considered the phenomenon of refraction, the
bending of light when it passes from one medium to an­
other, as from air to glass (lenses being the offspring of
70

THE ODDEST IF NOT THE MOST CONSIDERABLE DETECTION
refraction and geometry). Wearing a professor's gown of
scarlet, he stood before the few students who attended and
delivered news: rays of colored light differ from one another
in how sharply they are refracted. Each color has its own
degree of refraction. This was a bare, mathematical claim,
with none of the romance or metaphor that usually orna­
mented the philosophy of light.
Newton was not just drawing and calculating; he was also
grinding glass and polishing lenses in difficult, nonspherical
curves. Telescope makers had learned to their sorrow that
spherical lenses blurred their images, inevitably, because
rays of light failed to meet at a single point. Also, the larger
they made the lenses, the more they saw rings of unwanted
color-and Newton understood these now. The problem lay
not in imperfect craft but in the very nature of white light: not
simple but complex; not pure but mixed; a heterogeneous mix­
ture of differently refrangible rays. 15 Lenses were after all prisms
at their edges. He tried a new kind of telescope, based on a
reflecting mirror instead of a refracting lens.!> A big mirror
would gather more light than a small lens-in proportion to
its area, or to the square of its diameter. The difficulty was a
matter of craft: how to polish metal to the smoothness of
glass. With his furnace and putty and pitch he cast a tin and
copper alloy and refined its surface, grinding with all his
strength. In 1669 he had a stubby little tube six inches long
and magnifying forty times-as much as the best telescopes
in London and Italy, and as much as a refracting telescope
ten times longer."? He kept it for two years. He saw the disk
of Jupiter with its satellites, and Venus distinctly horned, like
a crescent moon. Then he lent it to Barrow. Barrow carried it
to London, to show his friends at the Royal Society.

Like no institution before it, the Royal Society was born
dedicated to information flow. It exalted communication
and condemned secrecy. "So far are the narrow concep­
tions of a few private Writers, in a dark Age, from being
equal to so vast a design," its founders declared. Science did
not exist-not as an institution, not as an activity-but they
conceived it as a public enterprise. They imagined a global
network, an "Empire in Learning." Those striving to grasp
the whole fabric of nature
ought to have their eyes in all parts, and to receive infor­
mation from every quarter of the earth, they ought to have
a constant universal intelligence: all discoveries should be
brought to them: the Treasuries of all former times should
be laid open before thern.!"
And in what language? The society's work included trans­
lation, contending with scores of vernacular dialects in
Europe, and even stranger languages were reported to exist
in faraway India and Japan. Latin served for standardiza­
tion, but the society's founders explicitly worried about the
uses of any language. Philosophy had mired itself in its own
florid eloquence. They sought "not the Artifice of Words,
but a bare knowledge of things." Now it was time for plain
speaking, the most naked expression, and when possible
this meant the language of mathematics.!?
Words were truant things, elusive of authorities, mal­
leable and relative. Philosophers had much work to do
merely defining their terms, and words like think and exist
73

ISAAC NEWTON
and word posed greater challenges than tree and moon.
Thomas Hobbes warned:
The light of humane minds is perspicuous words, but by
exact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity;
reason is the pace .... And, on the contrary, metaphors,
and senseless and ambiguous words are like ignes fatui; and
reasoning upon them is wandering amongst innumerable
absurdities.ê?
Galileo, having observed sunspots through his telescope
in 1611, could not report the fact without entering a se­
mantic thicket:
So long as men were in fact obliged to call the sun "most
pure and most lucid," no shadows or impurities whatever
had been perceived in it; but now that it shows itself to
us as partly impure and spotty; why should we not call
it "spotted and not pure"? For names and attributes must
be accommodated to the essence of things, and not the
essence to the names, since things come first and names
afterwards."
It has always been so-this is the nature of language­
but it has not always been equally so. Diction, grammar,
and orthography were fluid; they had barely begun to
crystallize. Even proper names lacked approved spelling.
Weights and measures were a hodgepodge. Travelers and
mail made their way without addresses) unique names and
numbers as coordinates for places. When Newton sent a
letter to the Secretary of the Royal Society, he directed it To

Palm ail in St Jamses Fields in Wéstminster. 22
Oldenburg was an apostle for the cause of collective
awareness-born Heinrich Oldenburg in the trading city of
Bremen (he was never sure what year), later Henricus, and
now Henry. He had come to England during the Civil War
as an envoy on a mission to Oliver Cromwell. He began
corresponding with learned men such as Cromwell's Latin
Secretary, John Milton; Cromwell's brother-in-law, John
Wilkins; the young philosopher Robert Boyle; and others­
soon to be the nucleus of the Royal Society. Then, as an
acquaintance put it, "this Curious German having well
improved himself by his Travels, and rubbed his Brains
against those of other People, was entertained as a Per-
son of great Merit, and so made Secretary to the Royal
Society."23 He was a master of languages and the perfect
focal point for the society's correspondence. He employed
both the ordinary post and a network of diplomatic couriers
to receive letters from distant capitals, especially Paris and
Amsterdam. In 1665 he began printing and distributing
this correspondence in the form of a news sheet, which he
called the Philosophical Transactions. This new creature, a
journal of science, remained Oldenburg's personal enter­
prise till the end of his life.>' He found a printer and sta­
tioner with carriers who could distribute a few hundred
copies across London and even farther.
The news took many forms. Mr. Samuel Colepress, near
Plymouth, reported his observations of the height and
velocity of the daily tides; from March to September, he
asserted, the tides tended to be a foot higher ("perpendicu­
lar, which is always to be understood") in the morning than
75

ISAAC NEWTON
in the evening.>? An author in Padua, Italy, claimed to have
discovered new arguments against the motion of the earth,
and a mathematician there disputed him, citing an exper­
iment by a Swedish gentleman, who fired shots from "a
Canon perpendicular to the Horizon" and observed whether
the balls fell toward the west or the east. Mr. Hooke saw a
spot on the planet Jupiter. A very odd monstrous calf was
born in Hampshire. A newly invented instrument of music
arrived: a harpsichord, with gut-strings. There were poison­
ous vipers and drops of poison from Florence. The society
examined the weaving of asbestos-a cloth said to endure
the fiercest fire-and models of perpetual motion.ês
N a sooner had the virtuosi begun to gather than Eng­
land's poets satirized their fixations and their questions.
Hooke himself made an easy target-his fantastic world of
fleas and animalcules. The natural philosopher could easily
be portrayed as a preoccupied pedant, and not so easily dis­
tinguished from the astrologer and the alchemist. "Which
way the dreadful comet went / In sixty-four and what it
meant?" asked Samuel Butler (his mockery tinged with
wonder).
Whether the Moon be sea or land
Or charcoal, or a quench'd firebrand ...
These were their learned speculations
And all their constant occupations,
To measure wind, and weigh the air
And turn a circle to a square.??
In fact, travel and trade, more than speculation or tech­
nology, fueled the society's business; bits of exotic knowl­
edge came as fellow travelers on ships bearing foreign

goods. Spider webs were seen in faraway Bermuda and 300-
foot cabbage trees in the Caribe Islands.> A worthy and
inquisitive gentleman, Captain Silas Taylor of Virginia,
reported that the scent of the wild Penny-royal could kill
Ratle-Snakes. A German Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher, re­
vealed secrets of the subterranean world: for example, that
the ocean waters continually pour into the northern pole,
run through the bowels of the earth, and regurgitate at the
southern pole.
Far away in Cambridge Newton inhaled all this philo­
sophical news. He took fervid notes. Rumors of a fiery
mountain: "Batavia one afternone was covered with a black
dust heavyer then gold which is thought came from an hill
on Java Major supposed to burne."29 Rumors of lunar influ­
ence: "Oysters & Crabs are fat at the new moone & leane at
the full." Then in 1671 he heard directly from the voice of the
Royal Society. "Sr," Oldenburg wrote, "Your Ingenuity is the
occasion of this addresse by a hand unknowne to you .... "
He said he wished to publish an account of Newton's
reflecting telescope. He urged Newton to take public credit.
This peculiar historical moment-the manners of scientific
publication just being born-was alert to the possibilities of
plagiarism. Oldenburg raised the specter of "the usurpa­
tion of foreigners" who might already have seen Newton's
instrument in Cambridge, "it being too frequent, the new
Inventions and contrivances are snatched away from their
true Authors by pretending bystanders."3o The philoso­
phers were proposing Newton for election as a fellow of
the society. Still, there were questions. Some of the skillful
examiners agreed that Newton's tube magnified more than
larger telescopes, but others said this was hard to measure
with certainty."! Some, ill at ease with the technology, com-
77

ISAAC NEWTON
plained that such a powerful telescope made it difficult "to
find the Object." Meanwhile Hooke told the members pri­
vately that he himself had earlier made a much more power­
ful tiny telescope, in 1664, just an inch long, but that he had
not bothered to pursue it because of the plague and the fire.
Oldenburg chose not to mention Hooke's claim.
Newton wrote back with conventional false modesty:
I was surprised to see so much care taken about securing
an invention to mee, of which I have hitherto had so little
value. And therefore since the R. Society is pleased to think
it worth the patronizing, I must acknowledg it deserves
much more of them for that, then of mee, who, had not the
communication of it been desired, might have let it still
remained in private as it hath already done some yeares.v
A fortnight later he set modesty aside. He wished to attend
a meeting, he told Oldenburg dramatically.
I am purposing them, to be considered of & examined, an
accompt of a Philosophicall discovery which induced me
to the making of the said Telescope, & which I doubt not
but will prove much more gratefull then the communica­
tion of that instrument, being in my Judgment the oddest if
not the most considerable detection which hath hitherto
been made in the operations of Nature.v
And by the way, what would his duties be, as Fellow of the
Royal Society?

Reluctancy and Reaction
THE GREAT COURT of Trinity College was mostly com­
plete, with a library and stables, central fountain, and
fenced-in plots of grass. An avenue of newly planted linden
trees lay to the southwest.' Newton occupied a chamber
upstairs between the Great Gate and the chapel. To the
west stood a four-walled court used for the game of tennis.
Sometimes he watched fellows play, and he noticed that
the ball could curve, and not just downward. He under­
stood intuitively why this should be so: the ball was struck
obliquely and acquired spin. "Its parts on that side, where
the motions conspire, must press and beat the contiguous
Air more violently than on the other, and there excite a
reluctancy and reaction of the Air proportionately greater.">
He noted this in passing because he had wondered whether
rays of light could swerve the same way-if they "should
possibly be globular bodies" spinning against the ether. But
he had decided against that possibility.
He did not go to London to appear before the Royal
Society after all-not for three more years-but he did not
wait to send Oldenburg his promised account of a philo­
sophical discovery. He composed a long letter in February
79

ISAAC NEWTON
1672, to be read aloud at a meeting. Within a fortnight Old­
enburg had it set in type and printed in the Philosophical
Transactions, along with a description of the East Indian
coasts and an essay on music.>
Newton's letter presented both an experiment and a
"theory.f" Six years before, he wrote, he had aligned his
prism in a sunbeam entering a dark room through a hole in
the window shutter. He expected to see all the colors of the
rainbow fanned against the wall and, indeed, he did-vivid
and intense, a very pleasing divertissement, he reported.
This phenomenon of colors was ancient. As soon as people
had glass-that is, as soon as they had broken glass-they
noticed the appearance of colors where two refracting sur­
faces formed a sharp edge. 5 A carefully formed triangular
prism manifested colors most perfectly. No one knew where
the colors came from, but it had seemed clear enough,
almost by definition, that a prism somehow creates colors.
Experimentum Crucis: The sunbeam from the window shutter passes
through one prism, separating it into colors; then a beam of colored light
passes through a second prism. The second prism has no further separation
to perform: the white light is a mixture, but the colored beams are pure.
80

RELUCTANCY AND REACTION
Newton noted a surprise (or so he claimed): where he
would have expected the refracted light to form a circle on
the wall-all the sun's rays being refracted equally-instead
he saw an oblong. He tried moving the prism, to see whether
the thickness of the glass made a difference. He tried vary­
ing the size of the hole in the window shutter. He tried a
second prism. He measured the distance from the aperture
to the wall (22 feet); the length of the colored oblong (13�
inches); its width (2% inches); and the angles of incidence
and refraction, known to be mathematically linked. He
noted that the sun was not a point but a disk, spread across
31 minutes of arc. The sunbeam was always in motion, and
he could examine it only for moments at a time, but he did
not let go of this small oddity-this peculiar elongation of
the image.
It led him (or so he reported) to the Experimentum Cru­
cis-the signpost at a crossroads, the piece of experience that
shows which path to trust. Newton took the high-plumed
phrase from Hooke, who had adapted it from Bacon." The
crucial idea was to isolate a beam of colored light and send
that through a prism. For this he needed a pair of prisms
and a pair of boards pierced with holes. He aligned these
and carefully rotated one prism in his hand, directing first
blue light and then red light through the second prism. He
measured the angles: the blue rays, bent slightly more by
the first prism, were again refracted slightly more by the
second. Most persuasive, though, was that the second prism
never created new colors or altered the colors shining from
the first prism. Years before, in his earliest speculation, he
had asked himself, "Try if two Prismas the one casting blue
upon the other's red doe not produce a white."? They did
81

ISAAC NEWTON
not. Blue light stayed blue and red stayed red. Unlike white
(Newton deduced) those colors were pure.
"And so the true cause of the length of that Image was
detected," Newton declared triumphantly-"that Light con­
sists of Rays differently refrangible." Some colors are refracted
more, and not by any quality of the glass but by their own
predisposition. Color is not a modification of light but an
original, fundamental property.
Above all: white light is a heterogeneous mixture.f
But the most surprising, and wonderful composition was
that of Whiteness. There is no one sort of Rays which alone
can exhibit this. 'Tis ever compounded, and to its com­
position are requisite all the aforesaid primary Colours,
mixed in due proportion. I have often with Admiration
beheld, that all the Colours of the Prisme being made to
converge, and thereby to be again mixed, ... reproduced

A prism does not create colors; it separates them. It takes
advantage of their different refrangibility to sort them out.
Newton's letter was itself an experiment, his first com­
munication of scientific results in a form intended for pub­
lication.? It was meant to persuade. He had no template for
such communication, so he invented one: an autobiograph­
ical narrative, step by step, actions wedded to a sequence of
reasoning. He exposed intimate feelings: his pleasure at the
display of colors, his uncertainty, and then above all his
surprise and wonder.
The account was an artifice, stylizing a process of discov­
ery actually carried out over years, on odd occasions, some-

times below the level of consciousness and computation. A
prism in a pencil-thin sunbeam actually makes a smudge of
color on a wall, uneven and unstable, its edges shadowy and
fading. He idealized what he described; the image made
sense only because he already knew what he was looking
for. He had already seen, years before, that blue light is bent
more than red; he had looked through a prism at red and
blue threads and noted their varying refraction. He also
knew that refracting lenses smeared colors; that was why he
had invented a reflecting telescope.
When Descartes looked at a prism in sunlight, he had
seen a circle of colors, not an oblong. A circle was the shape
he expected, and it was tiny, because he directed his prism's
light at nearby paper, not a wall twenty-two feet distant.
Newton wanted to see the oblong, the spreading; he wanted
to magnify it; he wanted to measure it against his geometri­
cal intuition about the laws of refraction; he believed in pre­
cision and in his ability to interpret small discrepancies.
83

ISAAC NEWTON
Indeed, he believed in mathematics as the road to under­
standing, and he said so: that he expected even the science
of colors to become mathematical. And this meant certain.
"For what I shall tell concerning them is not an Hypothe­
sis but most rigid consequence," he wrote, "not conjec­
tured by barely inferring tis thus because not otherwise ...
but evinced by the mediation of experiments concluding
directly & without suspicion of doubt."IO Oldenburg omit­
ted this sentence from the version he printed.
What was light, anyway? In this offering of a "theory,"
Newton chose not quite to commit himself, but he had
a mental picture: a ray of light was a stream of particles,
"corpuscles" -material substance in motion. Descartes had
thought light was pressure in the ether and color an effect of
the rotation of these ether particles; Hooke objected to that
and proposed the notion of light as a pulse, a vibration of
the ether, or a wave, like sound. Newton found Hooke's
theory galling. "Though Descartes may bee mistaken so is
Mr Hook," he wrote privately, in taking notes on his copy of
Micrographia. He had a simple argument against a wave
theory: light (unlike sound) does not turn corners. "Why
then may not light deflect from straight lines as well as
sounds &c?" 11 In his notes Newton wrote of light as glob­
ules, traveling at finite speed and impinging on the eye. In
his letter he stuck abstractly to rays. "To determine more
absolutely, what Light is, ... and by what modes or actions
it produceth in our minds the Phastasms of Colours, is
not so easie. And I shall not mingle conjectures with cer­
tainties." 12
Certainties or not, Newton's conclusions represented a
radical assault on the prevailing wisdom.i> For the next four
years the Philosophical Transactions boiled with controversy,
84

RELUCTANCY AND REACTION
month after month: ten critiques of Newton's letter and
eleven counters from Newton."? Oldenburg kept assuring
him of the society's applause for his ingenuity and frank­
ness and its concern that the honor of discovery might
be snatched from him and assumed by foreigners.l> In his
role as a clearinghouse for developments in mathematics,
Oldenburg discovered that he could use discoveries by for­
eigners-for example, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in Ger­
many-to pry secret knowledge from Newton. He grew
used to Newton's tantalizing style, always holding gems just
out of reach.
And in fact I know myself how to form a series ...
I cannot proceed with the explanation of it now ...
I have preferred to conceal it thus ...
Once this was known, that other could not long remain
hidden from me . . .
I have another method not yet communicated, ... a con­
venient, rapid and general solution of this problem, To
draw a geometrical curve which shall pass through any number
of given points .... These things are done at once geometri­
cally with no calculation intervening .... Though at first
glance it looks unmanageable, yet the matter turns out oth­
erwise. For it ranks among the most beautiful of all that I
could wish to solve."?
His mathematics remained mostly hidden. Regarding
light, however, he had exposed himself, and he regretted
85

ISAAC NEWTON
it. Hooke continued to attack. As Curator of Experiments
Hooke assured the society that he had already performed
these very experiments, hundreds of times. He was not a
little pleased, he said, with the niceness and curiosity of
Newton's observations, but he had to confess that he con­
sidered these arguments a mere hypothesis. He said that his
own experiments-"nay and even those very expts which
he alledged" -proved that light is a pulse in the ether and
that color is nothing but a disturbance of that light. He
would be glad to see "one Experimentum crucis from Mr
Newton" to make him change his mind, but this was not it.
A prism adds color to light, he insisted, just as an organ
pipe or a violin string adds sound to the air.'? A French
Jesuit, Ignace Pardies, wrote from Paris that Newton's
"hypothesis" would overthrow the very basis of optics; that
the oblong image could be explained by rays coming from
different parts of the sun's face; and that mixing colored
rays of light produces only a dark blur, not white. IS
All this angered Newton, especially the word hypothesis.
He was not offering a hypothesis, he said again, but "noth­
ing else than certain properties of light which, now discov­
ered, I think are not difficult to prove, and which if I did not
know to be true, I should prefer to reject as vain and empty
speculation, than acknowledge them as my hypothesis." 19
Oldenburg suggested that he respond without mentioning
names-especially Hooke's-but Newton had a different
idea. Months went by, and his rancor festered. When he
finally penned a long reply, it named Hooke in its first sen­
tence and on every page. "I was a little troubled to find a
person so much concerned for an Hypothesis)" he wrote,
"from whome in particular I most expected an uncon­
cerned & indifferent examination."
86

RELUCTANCY AND REACTION
Mr Hook thinks himselfe concerned to reprehend me ....
But he knows well that it is not for one man to prescribe
Rules to the studies of another, especially not without
understanding the grounds on which he proceeds. Had he
obliged me with a private letter ... 20
Hooke's rejection of the experimentum crucis was "a bare
denyall without assigning a reason," he asserted. Newton
wrote and rewrote this letter four times. It grew far longer
than his original report. He considered colors in bubbles
and froth; jabbed slyly at Hooke with suggestions for mi­
croscopy; and refined his distinction between pure colors
and compounded whiteness. There were many ways to mix
colors, he suggested, to produce white or (not so perfect
and intense) gray. "The same may be effected by painting a
Top (such as Boys play with) of divers colours, for when it is
made to circulate by whipping it will appear of such a dirty
color."
Above all, he wished to assert that optics was a mathemat­
ical science, rigorous and certain; that it depended on physi­
cal principles and mathematical proof; and that since he had
learned these principles he had met with constant success.
He implied again and again that Hooke was not really
performing the experiments. Hooke had "maimed" his ar­
gument. Hooke insisted on "denying some things the truth
of which would have appeared by an experimentall examina­
tion." True-Newton conceded-he was arguing for the
corporeity of light, but that followed from his theory, not the
other way around. It was not a fundamental supposition. In
suggesting that light was composed of particles, he had care­
fully used the word perhaps. "I wonder how Mr Hook could
imagin that when I had asserted the Theory with the great-
87

ISAAC NEWTON
est rigor, 1 should be so forgetfull as afterwards to assert
the fundamentall supposition it selfe with no more than a
perhaps. "
Hooke was Newton's most enthusiastic antagonist now,
but not his most able. Christiaan Huygens, the great Dutch
mathematician and astronomer, also favored a wave theory
of light. His understanding of refraction and reflection was
profound-and correct enough, when alloyed with New­
ton's, to survive up to the quantum era. But he, too, by way
ofletters to Oldenburg, raised initial questions about New­
ton's "hypothesis" and in return feit the young man's wrath.
He caught subtle errors that Newton would never quite
acknowledge; for example, Huygens suggested correctly
that white could be created not just by a mixture of all col­
ors but by the blending of pairs such as blue and yellow."
Fifteen months after his election to the Royal Society, New­
ton announced that he wished to withdraw-and not just
from the society but from all correspondence. "I suppose
there hath been done me no unkindness," he wrote Collins.
"But 1 could wish 1 had met with no rudeness in some other
things. And therefore 1 hope you will not think it strange if
to prevent accidents of that nature for the future 1 decline
that conversation which hath occasioned what is past."
Oldenburg begged him to reconsider, suggested he no
longer feel obliged to pay his dues, and assured him that the
Royal Society esteemed and loved him.F The criticism had
been so mild and so ordinary, though perhaps there had
been "incongruities." Newton had still never met any of
these men-Oldenburg, Collins, Hooke, or the others. He
wrote one more reply. "The incongruities you speak of, 1
pass by," he said. "But ... 1 intend to be no further sollici-
88

taus about matters of Philosophy. And therefore I hope you
will not take it ill if you find me ever refusing doing any
thing more in that kind."23 Oldenburg did not hear from
him again for more than two years.>'
He had discovered a great truth of nature. He had
proved it and been disputed. He had tried to show how sci­
ence is grounded in concrete practice rather than grand
theories. In chasing a shadow, he felt, he had sacrificed his
tranquillity.>

In the Midst of a Whirlwind
WHEN HE OBSERVED the world it was as if he had an
extra sense organ for peering into the frame or skele­
ton or wheels hidden beneath the surface of things. He
sensed the understructure. His sight was enhanced, that
is, by the geometry and calculus he had internalized. He
made associations between seemingly disparate physical
phenomena and across vast differences in scale. When he
saw a tennis ball veer across the court at Cambridge, he
also glimpsed invisible eddies in the air and linked them to
eddies he had watched as a child in the rock-filled stream at
Woolsthorpe. When one day he observed an air-pump at
Christ's College, creating a near vacuum in a jar of glass, he
also saw what could not be seen, an invisible negative: that
the reflection on the inside of the glass did not appear to
change in any way. No one's eyes are that sharp. Lonely and
dissociaI as his world was, it was not altogether uninhab­
ited; he communed night and day with forms, forces, and
spirits, some real and some imagined.
In 1675 Newton journeyed to London and finally ap­
peared at the Royal Society. He met in person these men
who had till then been friends and antagonists twice re-

IN THE MIDST OF A WHIRLWIND
moved, their spirits channeled through Oldenburg's mail.
Among the virtuosi made flesh was Robert Boyle, fifteen
years his senior and a mentor of Hooke's. Boyle was a fer­
vent corpuscularian; in his great polemic The Sceptical
Chymist he had developed a theory of fundamental particles
as the constituents of matter. He believed that all the phe­
nomena of nature could be explained by the combination
and organization of these atoms into mixed bodies, some
perfect and some imperfect and none more perfect than
gold.' He believed in the alchemists' greatest dream, the
transmutation of baser metals into gold, but he reviled their
traditions of secrecy- "their obscure, ambiguous, and al­
most l£nigmatical Way of expressing what they pretend to
Teach."2
They have no mind to be understood at all, but by the
Sons of Art (as they call them) nor to be understood even
by these without Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls.
His experiments with an air-pump were renowned, and his
own investigation of color had spurred Hooke and Newton
in turn. He greeted Newton warmly.
Over the next months Newton, back in Cambridge,
labored over a new manuscript. He set down in passionate
words his own corpuscular theory. Here, finally, was his
Hypothesis-he embraced the label he had denied so vehe­
mently before. "An Hypothesis," he titled it, "explaining the
Properties of Light discoursed of in my severall Papers."?
But he spoke of more than light alone; he was taking on the
whole substance of nature. His nemesis, Hooke, loomed
large. "I have observed the heads of some great virtuoso's to
91

ISAAC NEWTON
run much upon Hypotheses," Newton said, "as if my dis­
courses wanted an Hypothesis to explain them by." He
noted that "some" could not quite take his meaning when
he spoke of light and color in the abstract, and perhaps they
would understand better with an illustration. Thus-the
"Hypothesis."
He wanted Oldenburg to read this to the assembled
Royal Society but not to publish it. And he wanted his lis­
teners to understand a delicate rhetorical point. He did not
pretend to mathematical certainty here, even if, for conven­
ience," he chose to "speak of it as if I assumed it & pro­
pounded it to be beleived." Let no man "think me oblig'd to
answer objections against this script," he said. "For I desire
to decline being involved in such troublesome & insignifi­
cant Disputes."
This sheaf of papers posted to Oldenburg? blended cal­
culation and faith. It was a work of the imagination. It
sought to reveal nothing less than the microstructure of
matter. For generations it reached no further than the few
men who heard it read and then raptly debated it through
all the meetings of the Royal Society from December 1675
to the next February. Newton had peered deeper into the
core of matter than could be justified by the power of
microscopes. Through a series of experiments and associa­
tions he seemed to feel nature's fundamental particles just
beyond the edge of his vision. Indeed, he predicted that
instruments magnifying three or four thousand times might
bring atoms into view,"
He saw a vast range of phenomena to explain, and the
cool certainties of geometry had reached the limit of their
usefulness here. There were all kinds of chemical activity,
92

IN THE MIDST OF A WHIRLWIND
processes like vegetation, fluids that interacted with more
or less "sociableness." He closed his eyes to no problem
because it was too mysterious or intractable. He confounded
the distant members of the society with a vivid description
of an experiment revealing electricity, a power certain bodies
gained when excited: he rubbed a glass disk with cloth and
then waved it over bits of paper. They sprang to life:
Sometimes leaping up to the Glass & resting there a while,
then leaping downe & resting there, then leaping up & per­
haps downe & up again ... sometimes in lines perpendicu­
lar to the Table, Sometimes in oblique ones ... & turn often
about very nimbly as if ... in the midst of a whirlwind."
Irregular motions, he emphasized-and he saw no way to
explain them mechanically, purely in terms of matter press­
ing on matter. It was no static world, no orderly world he
sought to understand now. Too much to explain at once: a
world in flux; a world of change and even chaos. He gave
out poetry:
For nature is a perpetuall circulatory worker, generating
fluids out of solids, and solids out of fluids, fixed things out
of volatile, & volatile out of fixed, subtile out of gross, &
gross out of subtile, Some things to ascend & make the
upper terrestriall juices, Rivers and the Atmosphere; and
by consequence others to descend .... 8
The ancients had often supposed the existence of ether, a
substance beyond the elements, purer than air or fire. New­
ton offered the ether as a hypothesis now, describing it as a
93

ISAAC NEWTON
"Medium much of the same constitution with the air, but
far rarer, subtiler & more strongly Elastic." As sound is a
vibration of the air, perhaps there are vibrations of the
ether-these would be swifter and finer. He estimated the
scale of sound waves at a foot or half-foot, vibrations of
ether at less than a hundred thousandth of an inch.
This ether was a philosophical hedge, a way of salvaging a
mechanical style of explanation for processes that seemed
not altogether mechanical: iron filings near a magnet ar­
range themselves into curved lines, revealing "magnetic
effluvia"; chemical change occurs in metals even after they
have been sealed in glass; a pendulum swings far longer in a
glass emptied of air, but ceases eventually nonetheless, prov­
ing that "there remains in the glass something much more
subtle which damps the motion of the bob."? The mecha­
nists were laboring to banish occult influences-mysterious
action without contact. The ether, more subtle than air, yet
still substantial, might convey forces and spirits, vapors and
exhalations and condensations. Perhaps an ethereal wind
blew those fluttering bits of paper. Perhaps the brain and
nerve transmitted ethereal spirit-the soul inspiring muscle
by impelling it through the nerves.'? Perhaps fire and smoke
and putrefaction and animal motion stemmed from the
ether's excitation and swelling and shrinking. Perhaps this
ether served as the sun's fuel; the sun might imbibe the ethe­
real spirit "to conserve his Shining, & keep the Planets from
recedeing further from him." 11 (The apple had dropped
long since, but universal gravitation remained remote.)
Hooke, listening to Oldenburg read Newton's words
aloud, kept hearing his name. "Mr Hook, you may remem­
ber, was speaking of an odd straying of light ... near the
edge of a Rasor .... " Indeed, earlier in 1675 Hooke had
94

IN THE MIDST OF A WHIRLWIND
put forward his new discovery of the phenomenon later
known as diffraction: the bending of light at a sharp edge.
One way to explain diffraction-the only way, until quan­
tum mechanics-was in terms of the interference of waves.
Did this spreading of light rays mean that they could curve
after all, as sound waves apparently do around corners?
Newton said he was unsure: "I took it to be onely a new
kind of refraction, caused perhaps by the externall œthers
beginning to grow rarer a little before it come at the Opake
body .... " He recalled, though, that Hooke had been
pleased to answer that though it should be but a new kind
of refraction, yet it was a new one. What to make of this
unexpected reply, I knew not, haveing no other thoughts
but that a new kind of refraction might be as noble an
Invention as any thing els about light.
A noble invention, Newton agreed. But he remembered
having read about this experiment before Hooke's account.
He was obliged to mention that the French Jesuit Honoré
Fabri had described it; and Fabri in turn had got it from a
Bolognese mathematician, Francesco Maria Grimaldi."? It
was not Hooke's discovery.
Hooke grew irate. In evenings that followed he met with
friends in coffee-houses and told them that Newton had
commandeered his pulse theory. After all, Newton was
talking about color in terms of "vibrations of unequal
bignesses." Large vibrations are red-or, as he said more
carefully, cause the sensation of red. Short vibrations pro­
duce violet. The only difference between colors was this: a
slight, quantifiable divergence in the magnitude of vibra­
tion. Newton did not speak of waves. Nor for that matter
95

ISAAC NEWTON
had Hooke: waves were still a phenomenon of the sea. A
lack of vocabulary hindered both men; but what Newton
had seen was just what Hooke had sought.
This was insupportable. At the end of the second meet­
ing devoted to the Newton "Hypothesis," Hooke rose to
declare that the bulk of it had come from his Micrographia,
"which Mr Newton had only carried farther in some partie­
ulars."13 Oldenburg lost no time in reporting this claim
back to Cambridge.
Cambridge fired back. "As for Mr Hook's insinuation,"
Newton wrote Oldenburg, "I need not be much concerned
at the liberty he takes." 14 He wished to avoid "the savour of
having done any thing unjustifiable or unhansome towards
Mr Hook." So he analyzed the chain of logic and priority.
First, what is actually Hooke's? We must "cast out what he
has borrowed from Des Cartes or others":
That there is an ether. That light is the action of this ether.
That the ether penetrates solid bodies in varying degrees.
That light is at first uniform. That colors come from a
modification of light rays-accelerated to make red and
retarded to make blue, all other colors coming from some
mixture of red and blue.
All Hooke did was change Descartes's idea of a press­
ing motion in the ether to a vibrating one. Globules for
Descartes, pulses for Hooke. "In all this," Newton con­
cluded,
I have nothing common with him but the supposition that
œther is a Medium susceptible of vibrations of which sup-
96

IN THE MIDST OF A WHIRLWIND
position I make a very different use: he supposing it light it
self which I suppose it not.
For the rest-refraction and reflection and the produc­
tion of colors-Newton said he explained it all so differ­
ently from Hooke as to "destroy all he has said." He added
sarcastically, "I suppose he will allow me to make use of
what I tooke the pains to find out."
Hooke was poking at a soft spot in Newton's understand­
ing of light. Was it particle or wave? Newton was vacillating
on this matter now, as humanity would continue to vacillate
until twentieth-century physicists vanquished the paradox
by accepting it. Newton both exposed his uncertainty and
concealed it. He played a delicate game, ringing changes
on the word hypothesis, trying to distinguish between what
he knew and what he was forced to suppose. He supposed
the existence of an ether-mysterious and even spiritual­
because he could not dispense with such a thing, for now.
Oldenburg-no friend to Hooke-S-e-chose to surprise
him with a public reading of Newton's rejoinder at the next
Royal Society meeting. Finally, after years of jousting by
proxy, Hooke decided to take pen in hand and address his
adversary personally.!v He adopted a meek and philosophi­
cal tone. He said he suspected Newton was being misin­
formed; he had experience with such "sinister practices."
He did not wish to contend or feud or be "drawn to such
kind of warr." We are "two hard-to-yield contenders," he
proclaimed. "Your Designes and myne I suppose aim both
at the same thing which is the Discovery of truth and I sup­
pose we can both endure to hear objections."
Newton's famous reply came a fortnight later.!? If the
97

_ ..... '-' .I.�.c W ION
weapons of this duel were to be insincere politesse and exag­
gerated deference, he could wield them as well. He called
Hooke a "true Philosophical spirit." He gladly embraced
the proposal of a private correspondence. "What's done
before many witnesses is seldome without some further
concern than that for truth: but what passes between friends
in private usually deserves the name of consultation rather
than contest, & so I hope it will prove between you & me."
And then, for the matter of their dispute, he put on record a
finely calibrated piece of faint praise and lofty sentiment:
What Des-Cartes did was a good step. You have added
much several ways, & especially in taking the colours of
thin plates into philosophical consideration. If I have seen
further it is by standing on the sholders of Giants."
The private philosophical dialogue between Newton and
Hooke never took place. Almost two years passed before
they communicated again at all. By then Oldenburg had
died, Hooke had succeeded him as Secretary of the Royal
Society, and Newton had withdrawn ever more deeply into
the seclusion of his Trinity chambers.
98

9
All Things Are Corruptible
HIS DEVOTION to philosophical matters grew nonethe­
less. He built a special chimney to carry away the
smoke and furnes.'
By Newton's thirties his hair was already gray, falling
to his shoulders and usually uncombed. He was thin and
equine, with a strong nose and gibbous eyes. He stayed in
his chamber for days at a time, careless of meals, working
by candlelight. He was scarcely less isolated when he dined
in the hall. The fellows of Trinity College learned to leave
him undisturbed at table and to step around diagrams he
scratched with his stick in the gravel of the walkways." They
saw him silent and alienated, with shoes down at heel and
stockings untied. He feared disease-plague and pox-and
treated himself preemptively by drinking a self-made elixir
of turpentine, rosewater, olive oil, beeswax, and sack. In fact
he was poisoning himself, slowly, by handling mercury."
Noone could understand till centuries later-after his
papers, long hidden and scattered, began finally to be
reassembled-that he had been not only a secret alchemist
but, in the breadth of his knowledge and his experimenta­
tion, the peerless alchemist of Europe. Much later, when
99

ISAAC NEWTON
the age of reason grew mature, a fork was seen to have
divided the road to the knowledge of substances. On one
path, chemistry: a science that analyzed the elements of
matter with logic and rigor. Left behind, alchemy: a science
and an art, embracing the relation of the human to the cos­
mos; invoking transmutation and fermentation and procre­
ation. Alchemists lived in a realm of exuberant, animated
forces. In the Newtonian world of formal, institutionalized
science, it became disreputable.
But Newton belonged to the pre-Newtonian world.
Alchemy was in its heyday. A squalid flavor did attach to
such researches; alchemists were suspected as charlatans
pretending to know how to make gold. Yet the modern dis­
tinction between chemistry and alchemy had not emerged.
When the vicar John Gaule, an expert on witchcraft, assailed
"a kinde of prœstigious, covetous, cheating magick," he
called this malodorous practice by its name: chymistry.ï If
alchemists were known to treasure secrecy and obscure
their writings with ciphers and anagrams, these habits were
no bar for Newton, burrowing further inward. If they re­
vered arcane authorities and certain sacred texts, if they
adopted Latinate pseudonyms and circulated secret manu­
scripts, so for that matter did Christian theologians. New­
ton was a mechanist and a mathematician to his core, but
he could not believe in a nature without spirit. A purely
mechanical theory for the world's profusion of elements
and textures-and for their transformations, from one sub­
stance to another-lay too far beyond reach.
He met with mysterious men and copied their papers-a
W.S., a Mr. F.> He devised a pseudonym, Jeova sanctus
unus, an anagram of Isaacus Neuutonus. In the garden out-
100

ALL THINGS ARE CORRUPTIBLE
side his room he built a laboratory, a shed abutting the wall
of the chapel. His fire burned night and day.> To alchemists
nature was alive with process. Matter was active, not pas­
sive; vital, not inert. Many processes began in the fire: melt­
ing, distilling, subliming, and calcining. Newton studied
them and practiced them, in his furnaces of tin and bricks
and firestones. In sublimation vapors rose from the ashes of
burned earths and condensed again upon cooling. In calci­
nation fire converted solids to dust; "be you not weary of
calcination," the alchemical fathers had advised; "calcina­
tion is the treasure of a thing."? When a crimson-tinged
earth, cinnabar, passed through the fire, a coveted substance
emerged: "silvery water" or "chaotic water" -quicksilver. 8 It
was a liquid and a metal at once, lustrous white, eager to
form globules. Some thought a wheel rimmed with quick­
silver could turn unaided-perpetual motion." Alchemists
knew quicksilver as Mercury (as iron was Mars, copper
Venus, and gold the sun); in their clandestine writings they
employed the planet's ancient symbol, � . Or they alluded
to quicksilver as "the serpents."10
"The two serpents ferment well ... " Newton wrote at
one session. "When the fermentation was over I added �
16gr & the matter swelled much with a vehement fermenta­
tion .... " 11 Like other alchemists, he conceived of mercury
not just as an element but as a state or principle inherent in
every metal. He spoke of the "mercury" of gold. He partic­
ularly coveted a special, noble, "philosophical" mercury:
"this � ... drawn out of bodies hath as many cold super­
fluities as common � hath, & also a special form & quali­
ties of the metals from which it was extracted.!- Part of
mercury's esoteric appeal was its tendency to react with
101

ISAAC NEWTON
other metals. Applied to copper, lead, silver, and even gold,
it formed soft amalgams. A skillful practitioner could use
mercury to purify metals. Over time, mercury builds up in
the body, causing neurological damage: tremors, sleepless­
ness, and sometimes paranoid delusions.
Robert Boyle, too, was experimenting with mercury. In
the spring of 1676, Newton read in the Philosophical Trans­
actions an account "Of the Incalescence of Quicksilver with
Gold, generously imparted by B.R."13 He recognized the
inverted initials, and he suspected that the research drew
near the alchemists' dream of multiplying gold. "I believe
the fingers of many will itch to be at the knowledge of the
preparation of such a è;) ," he wrote privately. A dangerous
sort of knowledge might lie nearby-"an inlet to something
more noble, not to be communicated without immense
damage to the world."!" Newton believed-and knew Boyle
did, too-that the basic substance of matter was everywhere
the same; that countless shapes and forms flowed from the
varied operations of nature on this universal stuff. Why
should the transmutation of metals be impossible then?
The history of change was all around.
Like no other experimenter of his time, alchemist or
chemist, he weighed his chemicals precisely, in a balance
scale. IS Obsessed as always with the finest degrees of meas­
urement, he recorded weights to the nearest quarter of a
grain. He measured time, too; here, a precise unit was an
eighth of an hour. But measurement never replaced sensa­
tion: as his experiments fumed, he touched and sniffed and
tasted the slimes and liquors that emerged.
He probed for the processes of life and death: vegetation
and, a special case, putrefaction, which produces a "black-
102

ALL THINGS ARE CORRUPTIBLE
ish rotten fat substance" and exhales matter into fumes.
Nothing can be changed from what it is without putrefaction) he
wrote in haste, in his microscopic scrawl. First nature
putrefies, then it generates new things. All things are corrupt­
ible. All things are generable. And so the world continually
dies and is reborn. These exhalations, and mineral spirits,
and watery vapors, generate a rising air and buoy up the
clouds: "so high as to laos their gravity."!"
This is very agreeable to natures proceedings to make a
circulation of all things. Thus this Earth resembles a great
animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in œthereall
breath for its dayly refreshment and vital ferment .... This
is the subtil spirit which searches the most hiden recesses
of all grosser matter which enters their smallest pores and
divides them more subtly then any other materiall power
what ever.
Driving this cycle of death and life, inspiring this circula­
tory world, must be some active spirit-nature's universal
agent, her secret fire. Newton could not but identify this
spirit with light itself-and light, in turn, with God. He
marshaled reasons. All things, in the fire, can be made to
give off light. Light and heat share a mutual dependence.
No substance so subtly pervades all things as light. He felt
this in the depth of his being.
"Noe heat is so pleasant & beamish as the suns," he
wrote.
Through his alchemical study shines a vision of nature
as life, not machine. Sexuality suffused the language of
alchemy. Generation came from seed and copulation;

principles were male (Mercury) and female (Venus). Then
again:
these two mercuries are the masculine and feminine
semens . . . fixed and volatile, the Serpents around the
Caduceus, the Dragons of Flammel. Nothing is produced
from masculine or feminine semen alone .... The two
must be joined.!?
From the seeds, the seminal virtues, came the fire and the
soul. If alchemy was the closest Newton came to a worldly
exploration of sexuality, it crossed paths with a theological
quest as well. To alchemists the transmutation of metals
meant a spiritual purification. It was God who breathed life
into matter and inspired its many textures and processes.
Theology joined alchemy as the chief preoccupation of
Newton's middle decades.
The new mechanical philosophers, striving to create a
science free of occult qualities, believed in matter without
magic-inanimate brute matter, as Newton often called it.
The virtuosi of the Royal Society wished to remove them­
selves from charlatans, to build all explanations from reason
and not miracles. But magic persisted. Astronomers still
doubled as astrologers; Kepler and Galileo had trafficked
in horoscopes.l'' The magician, probing nature's secrets,
served as a template for the scientist. "Do you believe then,"
Nietzsche asked two centuries later, "that the sciences
would ever have arisen and become great if there had not
beforehand been magicians, alchemists, astrologers and
wizards, who thirsted and hungered after abscondite and
forbidden powers?"
104

ALL THINGS ARE CORRUPTIBLE
Descartes had gone to great lengths to purify his scheme,
substituting mechanical (but imaginary) vortices for hidden
(but real) forces like magnetism. Newton was rebelling
against Descartes, and nowhere more fiercely than in the
realm of the very small. The philosophers stood further
removed from atoms than from the stars. Atoms remained a
fancy, invisible to human sight. The forces governing heav­
enly bodies were invisible too, but ready to be inferred from
a mathematical treatment of the accumulating data. For any
practitioner of chemistry or alchemy, one question loomed:
what made particles cohere in the first place>'? What
caused inert atoms to stick together, to form minerals and
crystals and-even more wonderfully-plants and animals?
The Cartesian style was recklessly ad hoc, Newton thought.
It offered a different mechanical explanation for every new
phenomenon: one for air, another for water, another for
vinegar, yet another for sea salt-"and so of other things:
your Philosophy will be nothing else than a system of
Hypotheses.">' Newton wanted a universal cause.
As with the question of light's true nature, he chose a
narrow rhetorical path: veering past the question of whether
his program was or was not fundamentally mechanical, all
reduced to particles and forces. Of light he had said, "Oth­
ers may suppose it multitudes of unimaginable small &
swift Corpuscles of various sizes, springing from shining
bodies at great distances, one after another, but yet without
any sensible interval of time, & continually urged forward
by a Principle of motion."21 For the rest:
God who gave Animals self motion beyond our under­
standing is without doubt able to implant other principles
105

ISAAC NEWTON
of motion in bodies which we may understand as little.
Some would readily grant this may be a Spiritual one; yet a
mechanical one might be showne ....
Rather than turn away from what he could not explain,
he plunged in more deeply. Dry powders refused to cohere.
Flies walked on water. Heat radiated through a vacuum.
Metallic particles impregnated mercury. Mere thought
caused muscles to contract and dilate. There were forces in
nature that he would not be able to understand mechani­
cally, in terms of colliding billiard balls or swirling vortices.
They were vital, vegetable, sexual forces-invisible forces of
spirit and attraction. Later, it had been Newton, more than
any other philosopher, who effectively purged science of
the need to resort to such mystical qualities. For now, he
needed them.
When he was not stoking his furnaces and stirring his
crucibles, he was scrutinizing his growing hoard of alchem­
icalliterature. By the century's end, he had created a private
Index chemicus, a manuscript of more than a hundred pages,
comprising more than five thousand individual references
to writings on alchemy spanning centuries. This, along with
his own alchemical writing, remained hidden long after his
death.

Heresy, Blasphemy, Idolatry
THE FATHERLESS MAN, the fellow of the college named
Trinity, turned to Christian theology with the same
sleepless fervor he brought to alchemy. He started a note­
book, writing Latin headings atop the folios: Life of Christ;
Miracles of Christ; Passion, Descent, and Resurrection.
Some topics remained forever blank; some filled and then
overflowed with intense, scholarly, and troubled notes. The
topics that most absorbed his interest were the relation of
God and Christ, the father and the son, and most of all, De
Trinitate, Of the Trinity.' Here he swerved into heresy. He
abjured this central dogma of his religion: three persons in
one Godhead, holy and undivided. He denied the divinity
of Jesus and of the Holy Ghost.
England's universities were above all else instruments of
Christianity, and at each step in his Cambridge career New­
ton swore oaths avowing his faith. But in the seventh year of
his fellowship, 1675, a further step would be required: he
would take holy orders and be ordained to the Anglican
clergy, or he would face expulsion. As the time approached,
he realized that he could no longer affirm his orthodoxy.
He would not be able to take a false oath. He prepared to
resign."
107

ISAAC NEWTON
He believed in God, not as a matter of obligation but
in the warp and weft of his understanding of nature. He
believed in God eternal and infinite; a living and powerful
Lord holding sway over all things; omnipresent, in bodies
and filling the space that is empty of body> He believed in
God as immovable-and this belief fused with his vision,
still not quite defined, of absolute space." Newton's God
had established the rules by which the universe operates, a
handiwork that humans must strive to know. But this God
did not set his clockwork in motion and abandon it.
He is omnipresent not only virtually but also substan­
tially .... In him all things are contained and move, but he
does not act on them nor they on him .... He is always and
everywhere .... He is all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all
force of sensing, of understanding, and of acting. 5
If God was immutable, religion was not." Close study fed
both his faith and his heresy. He researched and wrote the
history of the church again and again. He read the Scrip­
tures literally and indulged a particular fascination with
prophecy, which he saw as complex symbolism to be unrav­
eled and interpreted. He considered this a duty. He set
down a catalogue of fifteen rules of interpretation and sev­
enty figures of prophecy. He sought the facts, dates, and
numbers. He calculated and then recalculated the time of
the Second Coming, which he understood to be the restora­
tion of primitive uncorrupted Christianity. He studied in
detail the description of the Temple of Jerusalem, a struc­
ture of "utmost simplicity and harmony of all its propor­
rions,"? and tried to reconstruct its floor plan from the long,
rambling algorithms of the Hebrew Book of Ezekiel-
108

HERESY, BLASPHEMY, IDOLATRY
So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me,
This is the most holy place. After he measured the wall of the
house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four
cubits, round about the house on every side. And the side cham­
bers were three, one over another, and thirty in order ....
-an intricate puzzle in prose, another riddle to be deci­
phered. He struggled to work out the length of the ancient
cubit. There seemed to be a message meant for him.
And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
the form of the house, ... and all the forms thereof, and all the
ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws
thereof' and write it in their sight.
The very existence of the Bible in English-long opposed
by the church establishment and finally authorized only a
generation before Newton's birth-had inspired the Puri­
tan cause. Vernacular versions of the Bible encouraged the
laity to look into the texts and make their own interpreta­
tions. Scholars applied the new philosophical tools to Scrip­
ture. Anyone could pursue biblical inquiry as a self-directed
enterprise; many tried to distinguish the pure Gospel from
its medieval accretions. Ancient controversies came back to
life. Newton was studying no less than the history of wor­
ship. He compared the Scriptures in the new English trans­
lation and in the ancient languages; he collected Bibles in
Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and French. He sought out and mas­
tered the writings of the early fathers of the church: saints
and martyrs, Athanasius and Arius, Origen, author of the
Hexapla, Eusebius of Caesarea and Epiphanius of Constan-
109

ISAAC NEWTON
tia, and dozens more. He embroiled himself in the great
controversy that tore at Christendom through the fourth
century, at Nicaea and Constantinople.
The Trinity was a mystery. It defied rational explanation.
It rested on a paradox that could be neither comprehended
nor demonstrated: that the Son is fully human and fully
divine. As a human Christ does not understand his divinity
all at once. Nonetheless he is of the same being, homoousious,
as the Father. One God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
In the early fourth century, Arius, an ascetic churchman
in Alexandria, led a rebellion against this doctrine. He
taught that God alone is fully divine and immutable; that
the Son was created, subordinate, and subject to growth
and change. For this heresy Arius was excommunicated
and condemned. His writings were burned. But enough
survived to persuade Newton, brooding over them a millen­
nium later, that the Trinitarians had carried out a fraud
upon Christianity. The fraud had been perfected by monks
and popes. The word trinity never appears in the New Tes­
tament. For explicit foundation in Scriptures, the orthodox
looked to the First Epistle of John: "For there are three that
bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Ghost: and these three are one." Only the King James Ver­
sion had the last phrase." Newton's critical reading per­
suaded him that the original texts had been deliberately
debased in support of false doctrine-a false infernal reli­
gion.?
In theology as in alchemy, he felt himself to be questing
for ancient truths that had been perverted in the dark his­
tory of the past centuries. Knowledge had been lost, veiled
in secret codes to hide it from the vulgar, distorted by blas­
phemers, priests and kings. He believed this to be true of
110

HERESY, BLASPHEMY, IDOLATRY
mathematics, too, the language of God. In all these realms,
he tried to recover words and laws once known and then lost.
He had a mission. He believed he was doing God's work.
"Just as the world was created from dark Chaos through the
bringing forth of the light," he wrote in one manuscript,
". . . so our work brings forth the beginning out of black
chaos and its first matter."IO In both alchemy and theology,
he cherished secrecy just as the new philosophers in Lon­
don repudiated it. No public science here: rather, meetings
with anonymous confidantes, barter of manuscripts, shad­
owy brotherhoods.
Arianism was undergoing a clandestine revival, but dis­
belief in the holy Trinity amounted to dangerous heresy
nonetheless. By putting his arguments to paper Newton
committed a crime that, if exposed, could have cost him his
position and even his freedom. I I
At the last moment, in 1675, Newton's precarious posi­
tion at Cambridge was rescued. The king granted his request
for a dispensation, an act that released the Lucasian profes­
sorship, in perpetuity, from the obligation to take holy
orders.'? This did not end his theological obsession. He per­
fected his heresy through decades of his life and millions of
words. He marshaled his arguments and numbered them:
1. The [word] God is no where in the scriptures used to
signify more then one of the thre persons at once.
2. The word God put absolutely without particular
restriction to the Son or Holy ghost doth always signify the
Father from one end of the scriptures to the other ....
6. The son confesseth the father greater then him calls
him his God, &c ....
Il. The son in all things submits his will to the will of
111

ISAAC NEWTON
the father. which could be unreasonable if he were equall
to the father.!"
N a gulf divided Newton's theological reasoning from his
physics and geometry. Logic proved that any divinity in the
subordinate aspects of God remained derived from and
dependent upon God. He drew a diagram:
To make this plainer suppose a, b & care 3 bodies of which
a hath gravity originally in it self by which it presseth upon
b & c which are without any origin all gravity ê
but yet by the pressure of a communicated to :
them do presse downwards as much as A
c
doth. Then there would be force in a, force in
b & force in c, & yet they are not thre forces but one force
which is originally in a & by communication/descent in
b & C.14
He would not even label years as AD, preferring AC:
Christ, but not the Lord. Jesus was more than a man but
less than God. He was God's son, a mediator between God
and humanity, chosen to be a prophet and messenger, and
exalted to God's right hand. If we could decipher the
prophecies and the messages, we would know a God of
order, not chaos; of laws, not confusion. Newton plumbed
both nature and history to find out God's plan. He rarely
attended church.
Anger blazed through his theology; reason followed
along behind. In his reading notes and "articles" and
"points" and "observations," his "Short Schem of the True
Religion" and his analysis of prophecies and revelations, he
112

HERESY, BLASPHEMY, IDOLATRY
raged against the blasphemers. He called them fornica­
tors-for he associated this special blasphemy with lust.
"Seducers waxing worse and worse," he wrote, "deceiving
and being deceived-such as will not endure sound doc­
trine but after their own lusts heap to themselves teachers,
having itching ears and turning away their ears from the
truth."15 Monks, with their unclean thoughts, had perpe­
trated this corruption.
He feIt Trinitarianism not just as error but as sin, and the
sin was idolatry. For Newton this was the most detested of
crimes. It meant serving false gods- "that is, Ghosts or
Spirits of dead men or such like beings."16 Kings were spe­
cially prone to it, "kings being apt to enjoyn the honour of
their dead ancestors," declared this obsessive scholar, who,
for himself, could not have been less apt to call on the honor
of dead ancestors.
He had seldom returned home to Lincolnshire since
the sojourn of the plague years, but in the spring of 1679
his mother succumbed to a fever. He left Cambridge and
kept vigil with her over days and nights, till she died. He,
the first-born son, not his half-brother or sisters, was her
heir and executor, and he buried her in the Colsterworth
churchyard next to the grave of his father.

First Principles
IN THE NEXT YEAR a comet came. In England it arose faint
in the early morning sky for a few weeks in November till
it approached the sun and faded in the dawn. Few saw it.
A more dramatic spectacle appeared in the nights of
December. Newton saw it with naked eye on December 12:
a comet whose great tail, broader than the moon, stretched
over the full length of King's College Chapel. He tracked it
almost nightly through the first months of 1681.1 A young
astronomer traveling to France, Edmond Halley, a new
Fellow of the Royal Society, was amazed at its brilliance.ê
Robert Hooke observed it several times in London. Across
the Atlantic Ocean, where a handful of colonists were strug­
gling to survive on a newfound continent, Increase Mather
delivered a sermon, "Heaven's Alarm to the World," to warn
Puritans of God's displeasure."
Halley served as a sometime assistant to a new office­
holder, the Astronomer Royal. This was John Flamsteed,
a clergyman and self-taught skywatcher appointed by the
King in 1675, responsible for creating and equipping an
observatory on a hilltop across the River Thames at Green­
wich. The Astronomer's chief mission was to perfect star
114

FIRST PRINCIPLES
charts for the Navy's navigators. Flamsteed did this assidu­
ously, recording star places with his telescope and sextant
night after night, more than a thousand observations each
year. Yet he had not seen the November comet. Now letters
from England and Europe alerted him to it."
Whatever comets were, omens or freaks, their singularity
was taken for granted: each glowing visitor arrived, crossed
the sky in a straight path, and departed, never to be seen
again. Kepler had said this authoritatively, and what else
could a culture of short collective memory believe?
But this year European astronomers recorded two: a
faint predawn comet that came and went in November
1680, and a great giant that appeared a month later and
dominated the skies till March. Flamsteed thought comets
might behave like planets." Immersed as he was in the
geometry of the sky, charting the changes in celestial per­
spective as the earth orbited the sun, he predicted that the
comet he had missed in November might yet return. He
watched the sky for it. His intuition was rewarded; he spied
a tail on December 10, and the tail and head together, near
Mercury, two days later. He had a friend at Cambridge,
James Crompton, and he sent notes of his observations,
hoping Crompton could pass them on to Newton. A fort­
night later he wrote again, speculating, "If we suppose it a
consumeing substant 'tis much decayed and the Fuell spent
which nourishes the blaze but I have much to say against
this hypothesis however you may consider of it and Pray let
me have your opinion."6 Newton read this and remained
silent.
A month later Flamsteed tried again. "It may seem that
the exteriour coat of the Comet may be composed of a
115

ISAAC NEWTON
liquid .... It was never well defined nor shewed any perfect
limb but like a wisp of hay."? He was persuaded more than
ever that the two comets were one. After all, he had pre­
dicted the reappearance. He struggled to explain the pecu­
liar motion he had recorded. Suppose, he said, the sun
attracts the planets and other bodies that come within its
"Vortex"-perhaps by some form of magnetism. Then the
comet would approach the sun in a straight line, and this
path could be bent into a curve by the pressure of the ethe­
real vortex." How to explain its return? Flamsteed sug­
gested a corresponding force of repulsion; he likened the
sun to a magnet with two poles, one attracting and one
repelling.
Finally Newton replied. He objected to the notion of
magnetism in the sun for a simple reason: "because the 0 is
a vehemently hot body & magnetick bodies when made
red hot lose their virtue." He was not persuaded that the
two comets were one and the same, because his exquisitely
careful measurements of their transit, and all the others
he could collect-6 degrees a day, 36 minutes a day, 3Yz
degrees a day-seemed to show acceleration suddenly al­
ternating with retardation." "It is very irregular." Even so,
he diagrammed Flamsteed's proposal, the comet nearing
the sun, swerving just short of it, and veering away. This he
declared unlikely. Instead he suggested that the comet
could have gone all the way around the sun and then
returned."? He diagrammed this alternative, too. And he
conceded a crucial point to Flamsteed's intuition: "I can
easily allow an attractive power in the 0 whereby the Plan­
ets are kept in their courses about him from going away in
tangent lines."
He had never before said this so plainly. In the gestation
116

FIRST PRINCIPLES
of the calculus, in 1666, he had relied on tangents to
curves-the straight lines from which curves veer, through
the accumulation of infinitesimal changes. In laying the
groundwork for laws of motion, he had relied on the ten­
dency of all bodies to continue in straight lines. But he had
also persisted in thinking of planetary orbits as a matter of
balance between two forces: one pulling inward and the
other, "centrifugal," flinging outward. Now he spoke of just
one force, pulling a planet away from what would otherwise
be a straight trajectory.
This very conception had arrived at his desk not long before
in a letter from his old antagonist Hooke. Now Secretary to
the Royal Society, in charge of the Philosophical Transactions)
Hooke wrote imploring Newton to return to the fold. He
made glancing mention of their previous misunderstand­
ings: "Difference in opinion if such there be me thinks
shoud not be the occasion of Enmity." 11 And he asked for
a particular favor: would Newton share any objections he
might have to his idea, published five years before, that
the motions of planets could be simply a compound of a
straight-line tangent and "an attractive motion towards the
centrall body." A straight line plus a continuous deflection
equals an orbit.
Newton, just back in Cambridge after settling his
mother's affairs, lost no time in composing his reply. He
emphasized how remote he was from philosophical matters:
heartily sorry I am that I am at present unfurnished with
matter answerable to your expectations. For I have been
this last half year in Lincolnshire cumbred with con-
117

ISAAC NEWTON
cerns .... I have had no time to entertein Philosophical
meditations .... And before that, I had for some years past
been endeavouring to bend my self from Philosophy . . .
which makes me almost wholy unacquainted with what
Philosophers at London or abroad have lately been em­
ployed about .... I am almost as little concerned about it
as one tradesman uses to be about another man's trade or
a country man about learning.F
Hooke's essay offered a "System of the World.,,!3 It paral­
leled much of Newton's undisclosed thinking about gravity
and orbits in 1666, though Hooke's system lacked a mathe­
matical foundation. All celestial bodies, Hooke supposed,
have "an attraction or gravitating power towards their own
centers." They attract their own substance and also other
bodies that come "within the sphere of their activity." All
bodies travel in a straight line until their course is deflected,
perhaps into a circle or an ellipse, by "some other effectual
powers." And the power of this attraction depends on dis­
tance.
Newton professed to know nothing of Hooke's idea.
"Perhaps you will incline the more to beleive me when I tell
you that I did not before the receipt of your last letter, so
much as heare (that I remember) of your Hypotheses."!"
He threw Hooke a sop, however: an outline of an experi­
ment to demonstrate the earth's daily spin by dropping a
ball from a height. "The vulgar" believed that, as the earth
turns eastward under the ball, the ball would land slightly
to the west of its starting point, having been left behind dur­
ing its fall. On the contrary, Newton proposed that the ball
should land to the east. At its initial height, it would be ro-
118

FIRST PRINCIPLES
tating eastward with a slightly greater velocity than objects
down on the surface; thus it should "outrun" the perpendi­
cular and "shoot forward to the east side." For a trial, he
suggested a pistol bullet on a silk line, outdoors on a very
calm day, or in a high church, with its windows well stopped
to block the wind.
He drew a diagram to illustrate the point. In it he allowed
his imaginary ball to continue in a spiral to the center of the
earth.'> This was an error, and Hooke pounced. Having
promised days earlier to keep their correspondence private,
he now read Newton's letter aloud to the Royal Society and
How a body falls to the center of the earth:

a. Newton: A body dropped from a height at A should be carried forward
by its motion and land to the east of the perpendicular, "quite contrary to
the opinion of the vulgar." (But he continues the path-erroneously-in a
spiral to the center.)
b. Hooke: "But as to the curve Line which you seem to suppose it to

119

ISAAC NEWTON
publicly contradicted it.16 An object falling through the
earth would act like an orbiting planet, he said. It would not
descend in a spiral-"nothing att all akin to a spirall"-but
rather, "my theory of circular motion makes me suppose,"
continue to fall and rise in a sort of orbit, perhaps an ellipse
or "Elleptueid." 17
Once again Hooke had managed to drive Newton into a
rage.!" Newton replied once more and retreated to silence.
Yet in their brief exchange the two men engaged as never
before on the turf of this peculiar, un-physical, ill-defined
thought experiment. It was "a Speculation of noe Use yet,"
Hooke agreed. After all, the earth was solid, not void. They
exchanged dueling diagrams.
They goaded each other into defining the terms of a pro­
found problem. Hooke drew an ellipse.!? Newton replied
with a diagram based on the supposition that the attractive
force would remain constant but also considered the case
where gravity was-to an unspecified degree-greater nearer
the center. He also let Hooke know that he was bringing
potent mathematics to bear: "The innumerable & infinitly
little motions (for I here consider motion according to the
method of indivisibles) ... " Both men were thinking in
terms of a celestial attractive force, binding planets to the
sun and moons to the planets. They were writing about
gravity as though they believed in it. Both now considered it
as a force that pulls heavy objects down to the earth. But
what could be said about the power of this force? First
Hooke had said that it depended on a body's distance from
the center of the earth. He had been trying in vain to meas­
ure this, with brass wires and weights atop St. Paul's steeple
and Westminster Abbey. Meanwhile the intrepid Halley, an
120

-�.--
FIRST PRINCIPLES
eager seagoing traveler, had carried a pendulum up a 2,500-
foot hill on St. Helena, south of the equator, and judged
that it swung more slowly there.
Hooke and Newton had both jettisoned the Cartesian
notion of vortices. They were explaining the planet's motion
with no resort to ethereal pressure (or, for that matter,
resistance). They had both come to believe in a body's in­
herent force-its tendency to remain at rest or in motion­
a concept for which they had no name. They were dancing
around a pair of questions, one the mirror of the other:
What curve will be traced by a body orbiting another in
an inverse-square gravitational field? (An ellipse.)
What gravitational force law can be inferred from a body
orbiting another in a perfect ellipse? (An inverse-square
law.)
Hooke finally did put this to Newton: "My supposition is
that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the
Distance from the Center Reciprocall" -that is, inversely as
the square of distance. 20 He got no reply. He tried again:
It now remaines to know the proprietys of a curve Line . . .
made by a centrall attractive power ... in a Duplicate pro­
portion to the Distances reciprocally taken. I doubt not
but that by your excellent method you will easily find out
what that Curve must be, and its proprietys, and suggest a
physicall Reason of this proportion.>'
Hooke had finally formulated the problem exactly. He
acknowledged Newton's superior powers. He set forth a
procedure: find the mathematical curve, suggest a physical
reason. But he never received a reply.
121

ISAAC NEWTON
Four years later Edmond Halley made a pilgrimage to Cam­
bridge. Halley had been discussing planetary motion in
coffee-houses with Hooke and the architect Christopher
Wren. Some boasting ensued. Halley himself had worked
out (as Newton had in 1666) a connection between an
inverse-square law and Kepler's rule of periods--that the
cube of a planet's distance from the sun varies as the square
of its orbital year. Wren claimed that he himself had guessed
at the inverse-square law years before Hooke, but could not
quite work out the mathematics. Hooke asserted that he
could show how to base all celestial motion on the inverse­
square law and that he was keeping the details secret for
now, until more people had tried and failed; only then
would they appreciate his work.ê- Halley doubted that
Hooke knew as much as he claimed.
Halley put the question to Newton directly in August
1684: supposing an inverse-square law of attraction toward
the sun, what sort of curve would a planet make? Newton
told him: an ellipse. He said he had calculated this long
before. He would not give Halley the proof-he said he
could not lay his hands on it-but promised to redo it and
send it along.
Months passed. He began with definitions. He wrote
only in Latin now, the words less sullied by everyday use.
Quantitas materiœ-quantity of matter. What did this mean
exactly? He tried: "that which arises from its density and
bulk conjointly." Twice the density and twice the space
would mean four times the amount of matter. Like weight,
but weight would not do; he could see ahead to traps of cir-
122

FIRST PRINCIPLES
cular reasoning. Weight would depend on gravity, and grav­
ity could not be presupposed. So, quantity of matter: "This
quantity I designate under the name of body or mass."23
Then, quantity of motion: the product of velocity and mass.
And force-innate, or impressed, or "centripetal" -a coin­
age, to mean action toward a center. Centripetal force could
be absolute, accelerative, or motive. For the reasoning to
come, he needed a foundation of words that did not exist in
any language.
He could not, or would not, give Halley a simple answer.
First he sent a treatise of nine pages, "On the Motion of
Bodies in Orbit."24 It firmly tied a centripetal force, inversely
proportional to the square of distance, not only to the
specific geometry of the ellipse but to all Kepler's observa­
tions of orbital motion. Halley rushed back to Cambridge.
His one copy had become an object of desire in London.
Flamsteed complained: "I beleive I shall not get a sight of
[it] till our common freind Mr Hooke & the rest of the
towne have been first satisfied.t'<' Halley begged to publish
the treatise, and he begged for more pages, but Newton was
not finished.
As he wrote, computed, and wrote more, he saw the pins
of a cosmic lock tumbling into place, one
by one. He pondered comets
again: if they obeyed the same

laws as planets, they must be an extreme case, with vastly
elongated orbits. He wrote Flamsteed asking for more
data.> He first asked about two particular stars, but Flam­
steed guessed immediately that his quarry was the comet.
"N ow I am upon this subject," Newton said, "I would
gladly know the bottom of it before I publish my papers."
He needed numbers for the moons of Jupiter, too. Even
stranger: he wanted tables of the tides. If celestial laws were
to be established, all the phenomena must obey them.
The alchemical furnaces went cold; the theological man­
uscripts were shelved. A fever possessed him, like none
since the plague years. He ate mainly in his room, a few
bites standing up. He wrote standing at his desk. When he
did venture outside, he would seem lost, walk erratically,
turn and stop for no apparent reason, and disappear inside
once again.ê? Thousands of sheets of manuscript lay all
around, here and at Woolsthorpe, ink fading on parchment,
the jots and scribbles of four decades, undated and disor­
ganized. He had never written like this: with a great pur­
pose, and meaning his words to be read.
Though he had dropped alchemy for now, Newton had
learned from it. He embraced invisible forces. He knew he
was going to have to allow planets to influence one another
from a distance. He was writing the principles of philosophy.
But not just that: the mathematical principles of natural phi­
losophy. "For the whole difficulty of philosophy," he wrote,
"seems to be to discover the forces of nature from the phe­
nomena of motions and then to demonstrate the other phe­
nomena from these forces."28 The planets, the comets, the
moon, and the sea. He promised a mechanical program­
no occult qualities. He promised proof. Yet there was mys­
tery in his forces still.
124

FIRST PRINCIPLES
First principles. "Time, space, place, and motion" -he
wished to blot out everyday knowledge of these words. He
gave them new meanings, or, as he saw it, redeemed their
true and sacred meanings.>? He had no authority to rely
on-this unsocial, unpublished professor-so it was a sort
of bluff, but he made good on it. He established time as
independent of our sensations; he established space as inde­
pendent of matter. Thenceforth time and space were special
words, specially understood and owned by the virtuosi­
the scientists.
Absolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself,
and of its own nature, without reference to anything exter­
nal, flows uniformly ....
Absolute space, of its own true nature without reference
to anything external, always remains homogeneous and
immovable .... 30
Our eyes perceive only relative motion: a sailor's progress
along his ship, or the ship's progress on the earth. But the
earth, too, moves, in reference to space-itself immovable
because it is purely mathematical, abstracted from our
senses. Of time and space he made a frame for the universe
and a credo for a newage.

Every Body Perseveres
IT WAS ORDERED, that a letter of thanks be written to Mr
NEWTON," recorded Halley, as clerk of the Royal Soci­
ety, on April 28, 1686, " ... and that in the meantime the
book be put into the hands of Mr HALLEY."!
Only Halley knew what was in "the book" -a first sheaf
of manuscript pages, copied in Cambridge by Newton's
amanuensis- and dispatched to London with the grand
title Philosophùe N aturalis Principia Mathematica. Halley
had been forewarning the Royal Society: "a mathematical
demonstration of the Copernican hypothesis"; "makes out
all the phenomena of the celestial motions by the only
supposition of a gravitation towards the centre of the sun
decreasing as the squares of the distances therefrom recip­
rocally,"> Hooke heard him.
It was Halley, three weeks later, who undertook the letter
of thanks: "Your Incomparable treatise," etc. He had per­
suaded the members, none of whom could have read the
manuscript, to have it printed, in a large quarto, with wood­
cuts for the diagrams. There was just one thing more he felt
obliged to tell Newton: "viz, that Mr Hook has some pre­
tensions upon the invention of the rule of the decrease of
126

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
Gravity .... He sais you had the notion from him [and]
seems to expect you should make some mention of him, in
the preface .... "4
What Newton had delivered was Book I of the Principia.
He had completed much of Book II, and Book III lay not
far behind. He interrupted himself to feed his fury, search
through old manuscripts, and pour forth a thunderous rant,
mostly for the benefit of Halley. He railed that Hooke was a
bungler and a pretender:
This carriage towards me is very strange & undeserved, so
that I cannot forbeare in stating that point of justice to tell
you further ... he should rather have excused himself by
reason of his inability. For tis plain by his words he knew
not how to go about it. Now is this not very fine? Mathe­
maticians that find out, settle & do all the business must
content themselves with being nothing but dry calculators
& drudges & another that does nothing but pretend &
grasp at all things must carry away all the invention ....
Mr Hook has erred in the invention he pretends to & his
error is the cause of all the stirr he makes ....
He imagins he obliged me by telling me his Theory, but
I thought my self disobliged by being upon his own mis­
take corrected magisterially & taught a Theory which
every body knew & I had a truer notion of it then him­
self. Should a man who thinks himself knowing, & loves
to shew it in correction & instructing others, come to you
when you are busy, & notwithstanding your excuse, press
discourses upon you & through his own mistakes correct
127

ISAAC NEWTON
you & multiply discourses & then make this use of it, to
boast that he taught you all he spake & oblige you to
acknowledge it & cry out injury & injustice if you do not, I
beleive you would think him a man of a strange unsociable
temper."
In his drafts of Book II, Newton had mentioned the most
illustrious Hooke-"CI[arissimus] Hockius'v=-but now he
struck all mention of Hooke and threatened to give up on
Book III. "Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious
Lady that a man had as good be engaged in Law suits as
have to do with her. I found it so formerly & now I no
sooner come near her again but she gives me warning."?
Hooke had not been the first to propose the inverse-square
law of attraction; anyway, for him it was a guess. It stood in
isolation, like countless other guesses at the nature of the
world. For Newton, it was embedded, linked, inevitable.
Each part of Newton's growing system reinforced the oth­
ers. In its mutual dependency lay its strength.
Halley, meanwhile, found himself entangled in the busi­
ness of publishing. The Royal Society had never actually
agreed to print the book. Indeed, it had only underwritten
the publication of one book before, a lavish and disastrously
unsuccessful two-volume History of Fishes. 8 After much dis­
cussion the council members did vote to order the Principia
printed-but by Halley, at his own expense. They offered
him leftover copies of History of Fishes in place of his salary.
No matter. The young Halley was a believer, and he em­
braced his burden: the proof sheets mangled and lost, the
complex abstruse woodcuts, the clearing of errata, and
above all the nourishing of his author by cajolement and
128

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
flattery. "You will do your self the honour of perfecting sci­
entifically what all past ages have but blindly groped after."?
The flattery was sincere, at least.
Halley sent sixty copies of Philosophiœ N aturalis Principia
Mathematica on a wagon from London to Cambridge in
July 1687. He implored Newton to hand out twenty to uni­
versity colleagues and carry forty around to booksellers,
for sale at five or six shillings apiece.!? The book opened
with a florid ode of praise to its author, composed by Hal­
ley. When an adulatory anonymous review appeared in the
Philosophical Transactions, this, too, was by Halley.!'
Without further ado, having defined his terms, Newton
announced the laws of motion.
Law 1. Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or
of moving uniformly straight forward) except insofar as it is
compelled to change its state by forces impressed. A cannon­
ball would fly in a straight line forever, were it not for air re­
sistance and the downward force of gravity. The first law
stated, without naming, the principle of inertia, Galileo's
principle, refined. Two states-being at rest and moving
unzformly-are to be treated as the same. If a flying cannon­
ball embodies a force, so does the cannonball at rest.
Law 2. A change in motion is proportional to the motive force
impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that
force is impressed. Force generates motion, and these are
quantities, to be added and multiplied according to mathe­
matical rules.
Law 3. To any action there is always an opposite and equal
reaction; in other words) the actions of two bodies upon each other
129

ISAAC NEWTON
are always equal and always opposite in direction. If a finger
presses a stone, the stone presses back against the finger. If
a horse pulls a stone, the stone pulls the horse. Actions are
interactions-no preference of vantage point to be assigned.
If the earth tugs at the moon, the moon tugs back.!-
He presented these as axioms, to serve as the foundation
for an edifice of reasoning and proof. "Law" -lex-was a
strong and peculiar choice of words.!> Bacon had spoken of
laws, fundamental and universal. It was no coincidence that
Descartes, in his own book called Principles of Philosophy,
had attempted a set of three laws, regulee queedam sive leges
naturœ, specifically concerning motion, including a law of
inertia. For Newton, the laws formed the bedrock on which
a whole system would lie.
A law is not a cause, yet it is more than a description. A
law is a rule of conduct: here, God's law, for every piece of
creation. A law is to be obeyed, by inanimate particles as
well as sentient creatures. Newton chose to speak not so
much of God as of nature. "Nature is exceedingly simple
and conformable to herself. Whatever reasoning holds for
greater motions, should hold for lesser ones as well." 14
Newton formed his argument in classic Greek geometri­
cal style: axioms, lemmas, corollaries; Q. E. D. As the best
model available for perfection in knowledge, it gave his
physical program the stamp of certainty. He proved facts
about triangles and tangents, chords and parallelograms,
and from there, by a long chain of argument, proved facts
about the moon and the tides. On his own path to these dis­
coveries, he had invented a new mathematics, the integral
and differential calculus. The calculus and the discoveries
were of a piece. But he severed the connection now. Rather
130

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
than offer his readers an esoteric new mathematics as the
basis for his claims, he grounded them in orthodox geome­
try-orthodox, yet still new, because he had to incorporate
infinities and infinitesimals. Static though his diagrams
looked, they depicted processes of dynamic change. His
lemmas spoke of quantities that constantly tend to equality or
diminish indefinitely; of areas that simultaneously approach
and ultimately vanish; of momentary increments and ultimate
ratios and curvilinear limits. He drew lines and triangles that
looked finite but were meant to be on the point of vanish­
ing. He cloaked modern analysis in antique disguise. IS He
tried to prepare his readers for paradoxes.
It may be objected that there is no such thing as an
ultimate proportion of vanishing quantities, inasmuch as
before vanishing the proportion is not ultimate, and after
vanishing it does not exist at all. . . . But the answer is
easy .... the ultimate ratio of vanishing quantities is to be
understood not as the ratio of quantities before they vanish
or after they have vanished, but the ratio with which they
vanish.!"
The diagrams appeared to represent space, but time kept
creeping in: "Let the time be divided into equal parts .... If
the areas are very nearly proportional to the times ... "
When he and Hooke had debated the paths of comets
and falling objects, they had dodged one crucial problem.
All the earth's substance is not concentrated at its center
but spread across the volume of a great sphere-countless
parts, all responsible for the earth's attractive power. If the
earth as a whole exerts a gravitational force, that force must
131

ISAAC NEWTON
be calculated as the sum of all the forces exerted by those
parts. For an object near the earth's surface, some of that
mass would be down below and some would be off to the
side. In later terms this would be a problem of integral cal­
culus; in the Principia he solved it geometrically, proving
that a perfect spherical shell would attract objects outside it
exactly as by a force inversely proportional to the square of
the distance to the center."?
Meanwhile, he had to solve the path of a projectile
attracted to this center, not with constant force, but with a
force that varies continually because it depends on the dis­
tance. He had to create a dynamics for velocities changing
from moment to moment, both in magnitude and in direc­
tion, in three dimensions. No philosopher had ever con­
ceived such a thing, much less produced it.
A handful of mathematicians and astronomers on earth
could hope to follow the argument. The Principia's reputa­
tion for unreadability spread faster than the book itself. A
Cambridge student was said to have remarked, as the figure
of its author passed by, "There goes the man that writt
a book that neither he nor anybody else understands."l8
Newton himself said that he had considered composing a
"popular" version but chose instead to narrow his reader­
ship, to avoid disputations-or, as he put it privately, "to
avoid being baited by little smatterers in mathematicks."!?
Yet as the chain of proof proceeded, it shifted subtly
toward the practical. The propositions took on a quality of
how to. Given a focus, find the elliptical orbit. Given three
points, draw three slanted straight lines to a fourth point.
Find the velocity of waves. Find the resistance of a sphere
moving through a fluid. Find orbits when neither focus is
given. Q.E.D. gave way to Q.E.F. and Q.E.I.: that which was
132

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
to be done and that which was to be found out. Given a para­
bolic trajectory, find a body's position at an assigned time.
There was meat for observant astronomers.
On the way, Newton paused to obliterate the Cartesian
cosmology, with its celestial vortices. Descartes, with his
own Principia Philosophùe, was his chief forebear; Descartes
had given him the essential principle of inertia; it was
Descartes, more than any other, whom he now wished to
bury. Newton banished the vortices by taking them seri­
ously: he did the mathematics. He created methods to com­
pute the rotation of bodies in a fluid medium; he calculated
relentlessly and imaginatively, until he demonstrated that
such vortices could not persist. The motion would be lost;
the rotation would cease. The observed orbits of Mars and
Venus could not be reconciled with the motion of the earth.
"The hypothesis of vortices . . . serves less to clarify the
celestial motions than to obscure them," he concluded.>' It
was enough to say that the moon and planets and comets
glide in free space, obeying the laws of motion, under the
influence of gravity.
Book III gave The System of the Wbrld. It gathered together
the phenomena of the cosmos. It did this flaunting an exac­
titude unlike anything in the history of philosophy. Phe­
nomenon 1: the four known satellites of Jupiter. Newton
had four sets of observations to combine. He produced
some numbers: their orbital periods in days, hours, min­
utes, and seconds, and their greatest distance from the
planet, to the nearest thousandth of Jupiter's radius. He
did the same for the five planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn. And for the moon.
133

ISAAC NEWTON
From the propositions established in Book I, he now
proved that all these satellites are pulled away from straight
lines and into orbits by a force toward a center-ofJupiter,
the sun, or the earth-and that this force varies inversely as
the square of the distance. He used the word gravitate. "The
moon gravitates toward the earth and by the force of gravity
is always drawn back from rectilinear motion and kept in its
orbit.">' He performed an apple-moon computation with
data he had lacked in Woolsthorpe twenty years before. The
moon's orbit takes 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes. The earth
measures 123,249,600 Paris feet around. If the same force
that keeps the moon in orbit draws a falling body "in our
regions," then a body should fall, in one second, 15 feet, 1
inch, and 1 � lines (twelfths of an inch). "And heavy bodies
do actually descend to the earth with this very force." No
one could time a falling body with such precision, but New­
ton had some numbers from beating pendulums, and, per­
forming the arithmetic, he slyly exaggerated the accuracy"
He said he had tested gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, salt,
wood, water, and wheat-suspending them in a pair of
identical wooden boxes from eleven-foot cords and timing
these pendulums so precisely that he could detect a differ­
ence of one part in a thousand.P
Furthermore, he proposed, the heavenly bodies must
perturb one another: Jupiter influencing Saturn's motion,
the sun influencing the earth, and the sun and moon both
perturbing the sea. "All the planets are heavy toward one
another."24 He pronounced:
It is now established that this foree is gravity, and therefore
we shall call it gravity from now on.
134

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
One flash of inspiration had not brought Newton here.
The path to universal gravitation had led through a se­
quence of claims, each stranger than the last. A force draws
bodies toward the center of the earth. This force extends all
the way to the moon, pulling the moon exactly as it pulls an
apple. An identical force-but toward the center of the
sun-keeps the earth in orbit. Planets each have their own
gravity; Jupiter is to its satellites as the sun is to the planets.
And they all attract one another, in proportion to their
mass. As the earth pulls the moon, the moon pulls back,
adding its gravity to the sun's, sweeping the oceans around
the globe in a daily flood. The force points toward the cen­
ters of bodies, not because of anything special in the cen­
ters, but as a mathematical consequence of this final claim:
that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every
other particle. From this generalization all the rest followed.
Gravity is universal.
Newton worked out measurements for weights on the
different planets. He calculated the densities of the planets,
suggesting that the earth was four times denser than either
Jupiter or the sun. He proposed that the planets had been
set at different distances so that they might enjoy more or
less of the sun's heat; if the earth were as distant as Saturn,
he said, our water would freeze.ê?
He calculated the shape of the earth-not an exact sphere,
but oblate, bulging at the equator because of its rotation. He
calculated that a given mass would weigh differently at dif­
ferent altitudes; indeed, "our fellow countryman Halley,
sailing in about the year 1677 to the island of St. Helena,
found that his pendulum clock went more slowly there than
in London, but he did not record the difference."26
135

ISAAC NEWTON
He explained the slow precession of the earth's rotation
axis, the third and most mysterious of its known motions.
Like a top slightly off balance, the earth changes the orien­
tation of its axis against the background of the stars, by
about one degree every seventy-two years. No one had even
guessed at a reason before. Newton computed the preces­
sion as the complex result of the gravitational pull of the
sun and moon on the earth's equatorial bulge.
Into this tapestry he wove a theory of comets. If gravity
was truly universal, it must apply to these seemingly ran­
dom visitors as well. They behaved as distant, eccentric
satellites of the sun, orbiting in elongated ellipses, crossing
the plane of the planets, or even ellipses extended to infin­
ity-parabolas and hyperbolas, in which case the comet
never would return.
These elements meshed and turned together like the
parts of a machine, the work of a perfect mechanic, like
an intricate clock, a metaphor that occurred to many as
news of the Principia spread. Yet Newton himself never
succumbed to this fantasy of pure order and perfect deter­
minism. Continuing to calculate where calculation was
impossible, he saw ahead to the chaos that could emerge in
the interactions of many bodies, rather than just two or
three. The center of the planetary system, he saw, is not
exactly the sun, but rather the oscillating common center of
gravity. Planetary orbits were not exact ellipses after all, and
certainly not the same ellipse repeated. "Each time a planet
revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the
motion of the Moon, and each orbit is dependent upon the
combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their
actions upon each other," he wrote. "Unless I am much

The comet of 1680- "as observed by Flamsteed" and "corrected by Dr.
Halley." Newton also collated sightings by Ponthio in Rome, Gallet in
Auignon, Ango at La Fleche, "a young man" at Cambridge, and Mr.
Arthur Storer near Hunting Creek, in Maryland, in the confines of Vir­
ginia. "Thinking it would not be improper, I have given . . . a true repre­
sentation of the orbit which this comet described, and of the tail which it
emitted in several places:" He concludes that the tails of comets always rise
away from the sun and "must be derived from some reflecting matter))­
smoke) or vapor.
mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to con­
sider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to
define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an
easy calculation."27
Yet he solved another messy, bewildering phenomenon,
the tides. He had assembled data, crude and scattered
though they were. Samuel Sturmy had recorded observa­
tions from the mouth of the River Avon, three miles below
Bristol. Samuel Colepress had measured the ebb and flow
in Plymouth Harbor. Newton considered the Pacific Ocean
and the Ethiopic Sea, bays in Normandy and at Pegu in the
East Indies.:" Halley himself had analyzed observations by
sailors in Batsha Harbor in the port of Tunking in China.
N one of these lent themselves to a rigorous chain of calcu-
137

ISAAC NEWTON
lation, but the pattern of two high tides per twenty-five
hours was clear and global. Newton marshaled the data
and made his theoretical claim. The moon and sun both
pull the seas; their combined gravity creates the tides by
raising a symmetrical pair of bulges on opposite sides of the
earth.
Kepler had suggested a lunar influence on the seas.
Galileo had mocked him for it:
That concept is completely repugnant to my mind .... I
cannot bring myself to give credence to such causes as
lights, warm temperatures, predominances of occult quali­
ties, and similar idle imaginings ....
I am more astonished at Kepler than at any other.
Though he has at his fingertips the motions attributed to
the Earth, he has nevertheless lent his ear and his assent to
the moon's dominion over the waters, to occult properties,
and to such puerilities.>?
Now Newton, too, resorted to invisible action at a distance.
Such arcana had to offend the new philosophers.
Before confronting the phenomena, Newton stated
"Rules of Philosophizing" -rules for science, even more
fundamental in their way than the laws of motion.
No more causes of natural things should be admitted than are
both true and sufficient to explain their phenomena. Do not
multiply explanations when one will suffice.
The causes assigned to natural effects of the same kind must
be) so far as possible) the same. Assume that humans and ani­
mals breathe for the same reason; that stones fall in Amer-
138

EVERY BODY PERSEVERES
ica as they do in Europe; that light is reflected the same way
by the earth and the planets.v'
But the mechanical philosophy already had rules, and
Newton was flouting one of them in spectacular fashion.
Physical causes were supposed to be direct: matter striking
or pressing on matter, not emitting invisible forces to act
from afar. Action at a distance, across the void, smacked of
magic. Occult explanations were supposed to be forbidden.
In eliminating Descartes's vortices he had pulled away a
much-needed crutch. He had nothing mechanical to offer
instead. Indeed, Huygens, when he first heard about New­
ton's system of the world, replied, "I don't care that he's not
a Cartesian as long as he doesn't serve us up conjectures
such as attractions.">! As a strategy for forestalling the
inevitable criticism, Newton danced a two-step, confes­
sional and defiant.
I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of
our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a
cause to gravity. . . . I have not as yet been able to de­
duce ... the reasons for these properties of gravity, and I
do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from
the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypothe­
ses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult
qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental
philosophy .... 32
So gravity was not mechanical, not occult, not a hypothesis.
He had proved it by mathematics. "It is enough," he said,
"that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that
we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions
139

ISAAC NEWTON
of the heavenly bodies and of our sea."33 It could not be
denied, even if its essence could not be understood.
He had declared at the outset that his mission was to dis­
cover the forces of nature. He deduced forces from celestial
bodies' motion, as observed and recorded. He made a great
claim-the System of the World-and yet declared his pro­
gram incomplete. In fact, incompleteness was its greatest
virtue. He bequeathed to science, that institution in its
throes of birth, a research program, practical and open­
ended. There was work to do, predictions to be computed
and then verified.
"If only we could derive the other phenomena of nature
from mechanical principles by the same kind of reasoning!"
he wrote. "For many things lead me to have a suspicion that
all phenomena may depend on certain forces by which the
particles of bodies, by causes not yet known, either are
impelled toward one another and cohere in regular figures,
or are repelled from one another and recede."34 Unknown
forces-as mysterious still as the forces he sought through
his decades-long investigation of alchemy. His suspicion
foresaw the program of modern physics: certain forces,
attraction and repulsion, final causes not yet known.
140

13
Is He Like Other Men?
As THE CENTURY BEGAN Bacon had said, "The me­
chanic, mathematician, physician, alchemist, and ma­
gician all immerse themselves in Nature, with a view to
works, but all so far with feeble effort and slight success." 1
He sought to prepare the stage for a new type, so far
unnamed, who would interpret and penetrate nature and
teach us how to command it. The prototype for scientist was
not quite ready.
Halley heralded the Principia in 1687 with the an­
nouncement that its author had "at length been prevailed
upon to appear in Publick.'? Indeed, Newton, in his forty­
fifth year, became a public man. Willy-nilly he began to
develop into the eighteenth-century icon of later legend.
Halley also wrote an introductory ode ("on This Splendid
Ornament of Our Time and Our Nation, the Mathematico­
Physical Treatise"). He sent a copy to the King- "If ever
Book was so worthy of a Prince, this, wherein so many and
so great discoveries concerning the constitution of the Visi­
ble World are made out, and put past dispute, must needs
be grateful to your Majesty'v-e-and for easier reading in­
cluded a summary of the explanation of tides; James II had
141

ISAAC NEWTON
been Lord High Admiral before succeeding his brother on
the throne.
"The sole Principle," Halley explained, "is no other than
that of Gravity) whereby in the Earth all Bodies have a ten­
dency toward its Center." The sun, moon, and planets all
have such gravitation. The force decreases as the square of
the distance increases. So a ton weight, if raised to a height
of 4,000 miles, would weigh only a quarter-ton. The accel­
eration of falling bodies decreases in the same way. At great
distances, both weight and fall become very small, but not
zero. The sun's gravity is prodigious, even at the immense
distance of Saturn. Thus the author with great sagacity dis­
covers the hitherto unknown laws of the motion of comets
and of the ebbing and flowing of the sea.
Truth being uniform, and always the same, it is admirable
to observe how easily we are enabled to make out very
abstruse and difficult matters, when once true and genuine
Principles are obtained."
Halley need not have bothered. James had other concerns.
In his short, doomed reign, he was doing all he could to turn
England toward Roman Catholicism, working his will on the
army, the courts, the borough corporations and county gov­
ernments, the Privy Council, and-not least-the universi­
ties. In Cambridge he made an antagonist of Newton.
The King asserted his authority over this bastion of
Protestantism by issuing royal mandates, placing Catholics
as fellows and college officers. Tensions rose-the abhor­
rence of popery was written into Cambridge's statutes as
well as its culture. The inevitable collision came in Febru-
142

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
ary 1687, when James ordered the university to install a
Benedictine monk as a Master of Arts, with an exemption
from the required examinations and oaths to the Anglican
Church. University officials stalled and simmered. The
professor of mathematics entered the fray-the resolute
Puritan, theological obsessive, enemy of idolatry and licen­
tiousness. He studied the texts: Queen Elizabeth's charter
for the university, the Act of Incorporation, the statutes,
the letters patent. He urged Cambridge to uphold the law
and defy the King: "Those that Councell'd his Majesty to
disoblige the University cannot be his true friends Be
courragious therefore & steady to the Laws If one
P[apist] be a Master you may have a hundred An hon-
est Courage in these matters will secure all, having Law on
our sides."> Before the confrontation ended, Cambridge's
vice-chancellor had been convicted of disobedience and
stripped of his office, but the Benedictine did not get his
degree.
Newton chose a path both risky and shrewd. Cambridge's
crisis was the nation's crisis in microcosm. In England's
troubled soul Protestantism represented law and freedom;
popery meant despotism and slavery. James's determination
to Catholicize the realm led to the downfall of the House of
Stuart. Within two years a Dutch fleet had invaded a divided
England, James had fled to France, and a new Parliament
had convened at Westminster-among its members, Isaac
Newton, elected by the university senate to represent Cam­
bridge. As the Parliament proclaimed William and Mary the
new monarchs in 1689, it also proclaimed the monarchy
limited and bound by the law of the land. It abolished the
standing army in peacetime and established a Declaration of
143

ISAAC NEWTON
Rights. It extended religious toleration-except, explicitly,
to Roman Catholics and to those special heretics who
denied the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity. For all this New­
ton was present but silent. He reported back to Cambridge
an argument with numbered propositions:
1. Fidelity & Allegiance sworn to the King, is only such
a Fidelity & Obedience as is due to him by the law of the
Land. For were that Faith and Allegiance more then what
the law requires, we should swear ourselves slaves & the
King absolute: whereas by the Law we are Free men .... 6
At the nation's hub of political power, he rented a room
near the House of Commons. He put on his academic
gown, combed his white hair down around his shoulders,
and had his likeness painted by the most fashionable por­
traitist in London." Word of the Principia was spreading in
the coffee-houses and abroad. He attended Royal Society
meetings and social evenings. He met, and found a kind
of amity with, Christiaan Huygens, now in London, and
Samuel Pepys, the Royal Society's president, as well as a
young Swiss mathematician and mystic, Nicolas Fatio de
Duillier, and John Locke, the philosopher in most perfect
harmony with the political revolution under way. Huygens
still had reservations about the Principia's resort to mysteri­
ous attraction, but none about its mathematical rigor, and
he promoted it generously. Huygens's friend Fatio con­
verted with loud enthusiasm to N ewtonianism from Carte­
sianism. Fatio began serving as an information conduit
between Newton and Huygens and took on the task of
compiling errata for a revised edition of the Principia. New-

ton felt real affection for this brash and hero-worshiping
young man, who lodged with him increasingly in London
and visited him in Cambridge.
Locke had just completed a great work of his own,
An Essay Concerning Human Understanding) and saw the
Principia as an exemplar of methodical knowledge. He did
not pretend to follow the mathematics. They discussed
theology-Locke amazed at the depth of Newton's bibli­
cal knowledge-and these paragons of rationality found
themselves kindred spirits in the dangerous area of anti­
Trinitarianism. Newton began to send Locke treatises on
"corruptions of Scripture," addressing them stealthily to a
nameless "Friend." These letters ran many thousands of
words. You seemed curious, Newton wrote, about the truth
of the text of 1 John 5:7: "the testimony of the three in
heaven." This was the keystone, the reference to the Father)
the œbrd) and the Holy Ghost. Newton had traced the passage
through all ages: interpretation of the Latins, words in­
serted by St. Jerome, abuses of the Roman church, attribu­
tions by the Africans to the Vandals, variations in the
margins. He said he placed his trust in Locke's prudence
and calmness of temper. "There cannot be a better service
done to the truth then to purge it of things spurious.l" he
said-but he nonetheless forbade Locke to publish this dan­
gerous nonconformist scholarship.
In disputable places I love to take up with what I can best
understand. Tis the temper of the hot and superstitious
part of mankind in matters of religion ever to be fond of
mysteries, & for that reason to like best what they under­
stand least.
145

ISAAC NEWTON
Meanwhile Pepys, who found his own mysteries in Lon­
don's clubs and gaming tables, came to Newton for advice
on a matter of recreational philosophy: "the Doctrine of
determining between the true proportions of the Hazards
incident to this or that given Chance or Lot." He was
throwing dice for money and needed a mathematician's
guidance. He asked:
A-has 6 dice in a Box, with which he is to fling a 6.
B-has in another Box 12 Dice, with which he is to fling 2
Sixes.
C-has in another Box 18 Dice, with which he is to fling 3
Sixes.
Q. whether B & C have not as easy a Taske as A, at even
luck??
Newton explained why A has the best odds and gave Pepys
the exact expectations, on a wager of £ 1,000, in pounds,
shillings, and pence.
All these men maneuvered via friendly royal connections
to seek a decorous and lucrative appointment for Newton
in the capital. He pretended to demur-"the confinement
to the London air & a formal way of life is what I am not
fond of" lü-but these plans tempted him.
London had flourished in the quarter-century since the
plague and the fire. Thousands of homes rose with walls
of brick, Christopher Wren designed a new St. Paul's
Cathedral, streets were widened and straightened. The city
rivaled Paris and Amsterdam as a center of trading net­
works and a world capital of finance. England's trade and
146

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
manufacturing were more centralized at one urban focus
than ever before or since. News-papers appeared from
coffee-houses and printers in Fleet Street; some sold hun­
dreds of copies. Merchants issued gazettes, and astrologers
made almanacs. The flow of information seemed instanta­
neous compared to decades past. Daniel Defoe, recalling
the plague year, wrote, "We had no such thing as printed
newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports
of things, ... so that things did not spread instantly over
the whole nation, as they do now." 11 It was understood
that knowledge meant power, even knowledge of numbers
and stars. The esoteric arts of mathematics and astronomy
acquired patrons greater than the Royal Society: the Navy
and the Ordnance Office. Would-be virtuosi could follow
periodicals that sprang into being in the eighties and nine­
ties: �ekry Memorials for the Ingenious and Miscellaneous Let­
ters Giving an Account of the Wôrks of the Learned.ï?
Of the Principia itself, fewer than a thousand copies had
been printed. These were almost impossible to find on the
Continent, but anonymous reviews appeared in three young
journals in the spring and summer of 1688, and the book's
reputation spread.'? When the Marquis de l'Hôpital won­
dered why no one knew what shape let an object pass through
a fluid with the least resistance, the Scottish mathematician
John Arbuthnot told him that this, too, was answered in New­
ton's masterwork: "He cried out with admiration Good god
what a fund of knowledge there is in that book? ... Does he
eat & drink & sleep? Is he like other men?" 14
Its publication notwithstanding, he had never stopped
working on the Principia. He was preparing a second edi­
tion. He scoured Greek texts for clues to his belief that the
ancients had known about gravity and even the inverse-
147

ISAAC NEWTON
square law. He contemplated new experiments and sought
new data for his complex theory of the moon's motions.
Besides correcting printer's errors, he was drafting and
redrafting whole new sections, refining his rules for philoso­
phy. He struggled with the inescapable hole in his under­
standing of gravity's true nature. He twisted and turned:
"Tis inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should
(without the mediation of something else which is not mate­
rial) operate upon & affect other matter without mutual
contact," he wrote one correspondent. "Gravity must be
caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain
laws, but whether this agent be material or immaterial is a
question 1 have left to the consideration of my readers." 15
He also pretended to leave to his readers-yet wrestled
incessantly with-the Deity lurking in his margins. God
informed Newton's creed of absolute space and absolute
time. "Can God be nowhere when the moment of time is
everywhere?" he wrote in one of many new drafts that did
not see Iight.!> An active, interventionist God must organ­
ize the universe and the solar system: otherwise substance
would be evenly diffused through infinite space or gathered
together in one great mass. Surely God's hand could be
seen in the division between dark matter, like the planets,
and shining matter, like the sun. All this "1 do not think
explicable by mere natural causes but am forced to ascribe
it to the counsel & contrivance of a voluntary Agent." 17 He
returned to his alchemical experiments, too.
Whether or not Newton was like other men, by the summer
of 1693 he was eating and sleeping poorly. He had lived fifty
148

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
years. He was unsettled, back and forth between the fens of
Cambridgeshire and the London glare. At Cambridge his
sinecure remained intact, but he scarcely taught or lectured
now. In London he was angling for posts that required the
king's patronage-a position at the Royal Mint, among
others-but did not fully understand his own desires. He
was uneasy in his relations with his new friends, tenuous
though these relations were, after a life with little practice in
friendship. Fatio had tormented him by falling ill and fore­
shadowing his own death- "I got a grievous cold, which is
fallen upon my lungs. My head is something out of order .
If I am to depart this life I could wish my eldest brother .
to succeed me in Your friendship" -and then by abruptly
ending their relationship and returning to Switzerland. IS
(Fatio survived sixty years more.)
Sexual feelings, too, troubled Newton's nights. He had
long since embraced celibacy. For this he had devised a
rational program:
The way to chastity is not to struggle directly with inconti­
nent thoughts but to avert the thoughts by some imploy­
ment, or by reading, or meditating on other things ....
Still, unwanted thoughts came. Ceaseless ratiocination dis­
ordered his senses .
. . . the body is also put out of its due temper & for want of
sleep the fansy is invigorated about what ever it sets it self
upon & by degrees inclines toward a delirium in so much
that those Monks who fasted most arrived to a state of see­
ing apparitions of weomen & their shapes .... 19
149

ISAAC NEWTON
Reclusive though he remained, rumors of Newton's
mental state began to reach places where just a few years
earlier his name had meant nothing: Fire had supposedly
destroyed his papers. He was in a state of frenzy or melan­
choly or distemper. His friends had locked him away.ê? He
had lost all capacity for philosophical thought.
Only Pepys and Locke knew the truth. They received
accusatory, delusional, and then pitiable letters. First New­
ton wrote Pepys:
... for I am extremely troubled at the embroilment I am in,
and have neither ate nor slept well this twelve month, nor
have my former consistency of mind. I never designed to
get anything by your interest, nor by King James favour,
but am now sensible that I must withdraw from your
acquaintance, and see neither you nor the rest of my
friends any more ....
Then Locke:
Sir-
Being of opinion that you endeavoured to embroil me
with woemen & by other means I was so much affected
with it as that when one told me you were sickly and would
not live I answered twere better you were dead. . . . I beg
your pardon also for saying or thinking that there was a
designe to sell me an office, or to embroile me. I am
your most humble & most
unfortunate Servant
Is. Newtorr"
150

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
Sex and ambition-all embroiled. Madness and genius as
well; in the reputation spreading now, these imponderable
qualities reinforced each other. Pepys bruited suggestive
hints. "I was loth at first dash to tell you," he wrote one
friend. He was concerned, "lest it should arise from that
which of all mankind 1 should least dread from him and
most lament for,-I mean a discomposure in head, or
mind, or both."22
Yet by fall Newton delved again into mathematical stud­
ies. He was systematizing ancient geometrical analysis: espe­
cially the quadrature and construction of unruly curves. He
continued to think of this work as rediscovery and restora­
tion. After all, no one had fully plumbed the ancients'
secrets. Lost manuscripts still turned up in dusty collec­
tions. There was such grandeur and purity in these old
truths, which could burst into life, preserved across the mil­
lennium in Arabic as if in amber. "The Analysis of the
Ancients," he wrote, "is more simple more ingenious &
more fit for a Geometer than the Algebra of the Moderns."23
Once again Newton's own studies, even when they were
most innovative, were for himself alone. With few excep­
tions his treatises remained in the purgatory of his private
papers.
At the University of Oxford enthusiastic students (but there
were few) could already hear astronomical lectures on the
system of Newton.>' Not at Cambridge, however. "We at
Cambridge, poor Wretches, were ignominiously studying
the fictitious Hypotheses of the Cartesian," one fellow
recalled later.>
151

ISAAC NEWTON
On the continent of Europe the Newtonian ideas were
inspiring philosophers to frantic reformulations of their
own theories. "Vortices destroyed by Newton," Huygens
jotted. "Vortices of spherical motion in their place."26 He
debated mechanisms of gravity with the German mathe­
matician and diplomat Gottfried Leibniz, who was rushing
to publish his own version of planetary dynamics. "I noticed
you are in favor of a vacuum and of atoms," Leibniz wrote.
"I do not see the necessity which compels you to return
to such extraordinary entities."27 Newton's unmechanical
gravity appalled him. "The fundamental principle of rea­
soning is, nothing is without cause)" he wrote. "Some con­
ceive gravity to signify the attraction of bodies toward the
bulk of the Earth, or their enticement towards it by a cer­
tain sympathy .... He is admitting that no cause underlies
the truth that a stone falls towards the Earth."28 It look
Leibniz another year to brave an approach to Newton him­
self. He penned a salutation in grand style across a sheet of
paper: "illustri viro ISAACO NEUTONO." 29
"How great I think the debt owed you, . . ." Leibniz
began. He mentioned that he, too, had been trying to
extend geometry with a new kind of mathematical analysis,
"the application of convenient symbols which exhibit differ­
ences and sums .... And the attempt did not go badly. But
to put the last touches I am still looking for something big
from you." He confessed that he had been looking every­
where for publications by Newton. He had come across the
name in a catalogue of English books, but that was a differ­
ent Newton.
Besides mathematics Newton had returned to the most
tortuous unfinished problem in the Principia: a full theory
152

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
of the moon's motion. This was no mere academic exercise;
given a precise recipe for predicting the moon's place in the
sky, sailors with handheld astrolabes should finally be able
to calculate their longitude at sea. A lunar theory should
follow from Newton's theory of gravity: the ellipse of the
lunar orbit crosses the earth's own orbital plane at a slant
angle; the sun's attraction twists the lunar orbit, apogee and
perigee revolving over a period of roughly nine years. But
the force of solar gravity itself varies as the earth and moon,
in their irregular dance, approach and recede from the sun.
With a revised edition of the Principia in mind, he needed
more data, and this meant calling upon the Astronomer
Royal. Late in the summer of 1694 he boarded a small boat
to journey down the River Thames and visit, for the first
time, Flamsteed in Greenwich. He pried loose fifty lunar
observations and a promise of one hundred more. Flam­
steed was reluctant, and he demanded secrecy, because he
considered these records his personal property. Soon N ew­
ton wanted more-syzygies and quadratures and octants,
to be delivered by Flamsteed via penny post to a carrier
who traveled between London and Cambridge every week.
Flamsteed insisted on signed receipts. Newton cajoled
Flamsteed and then pressured him. Revealing the data
would make Flamsteed famous, Newton promised-"make
you readily acknowledged the most exact observer that has
hitherto appeared in the world." But the data alone would
be worthless without a theory to give them meaning-"if
you publish them without such a theory ... they will only
be thrown into the heap of the observations of former
astronomers.v f Indeed these men needed each other­
Newton desperate for data that no one else in England could
153

ISAAC NEWTON
provide; Flamsteed desperate for any sign of gratitude or
respect (" Mr N s approbation is more to me then the cry of
all the Ignorant in the world," he wrote that winter)-and
before long, they hated each other.
Two struggles continued in parallel: Newton grappled
with Flamsteed and with a fiendish dynamical perturbation
problem. When the astronomer complained of headaches,
Newton advised him to bind his head with a garter."
Finally he learned that Flamsteed had let people know
about the work in progress and rebuked him bitterly:
I was concerned to be publickly brought upon the stage
about what perhaps will never be fitted for the publick &
thereby the world put into an expectation of what perhaps
they are never like to have. I do not love to be printed upon
every occasion much less to be dunned & teezed by for­
reigners about Mathematical things or thought by our own
people to be trifling away my time .... 32
Flamsteed spilled his agony into the margins: "Was Mr
Newton a trifter when he read Mathematicks for a sallery at
Cambridge," he railed, and then added, "Persons thinke
too well of themselves to acknowledge they are beholden to
those who have furnisht them with the feathers they pride
themselves in."33 Flamsteed took some small pleasure in
reporting rumors of Newton's death: "It served me to
assure your freinds that you were in health they haveing
heard that you were dead againe." In return, for the rest of
Flamsteed's life, he was a victim of Newton's implacable
ruthlessness.
But Newton's fear of raising expectations was genuine.
154

IS HE LIKE OTHER MEN?
He grappled with distortions in the data caused by atmos­
pheric refraction. The gravitational interaction of three
disparate bodies did not lend itself to ready solution.
He did ultimately produce a practical formula for calcu­
lating the moon's motion: a hybrid sequence of equations
and measurements that appeared first in 1702, as five Latin
pages inside David Gregory's grand Astronomiœ Elementa.
Gregory called it Newton's theory) but in the end Newton
had omitted any mention of gravitation and buried his gen­
eral picture under a mass of details. (He began: "The Royal
Observatory at Greenwich is to the West of the Meridian of
Paris 2° 19'. OfUraniburgh 12° 51' 30". And of Gedanum
18° 48' .") Halley quickly reprinted Newton's text as a book­
let in English, saying, "I thought it would be a good service
to our Nation .... For as Dr. Gregory's Astronomy is a large
and scarce Book, it is neither everyone's Money that can
purchase it." Halley hailed the theory's exactness and hoped
to encourage people to use it, but "the Famous Mr. Isaac
Newton's Theory of the Moon" was little noted and quickly
forgotten."?
Newton abandoned his Cambridge cloister for good in
1696. His smoldering ambition for royal preferment was
fulfilled. Trinity had been his home for thirty-five years, but
he departed quickly and left no friends behind;" As he
emphatically told Flamsteed, he was now occupied by the
King's business. He had taken charge of the nation's coin.

No Man Is a Witness
in His Own Cause
WHEN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENDED, the pub­
lished work of Isaac Newton amounted to little more
than the several hundred copies of the Principia, most in
England, a few scattered on the Continent. They were not
much read, but scarcity made them valuable. Before a second
edition was ready (in 1 713, a quarter-century after first pub­
lication) a copy cost two guineas. At least one student saved
his money and made a copy by hand.! Newton's nascent leg­
end diffused only by word of mouth in a tiny community.
When an anonymous solution to an esoteric geometry prob­
lem made its way to Holland, Johann Bernoulli announced
that he recognized the solver" ex ungue leonem" -the lion by
his claw." In Berlin, Leibniz told the Queen of Prussia that in
mathematics there was all previous history, from the begin­
ning of the world, and then there was Newton; and that
Newton's was the better half.3 Tsar Peter of Russia traveled
to England in 1698 eager to see several phenomena: ship­
building, the Greenwich Observatory, the Mint, and Isaac
Newton."
The Royal Society was becalmed, its finances ragged, its
membership dwindling. Hooke still dominated. Even living
156

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
in London, Newton mostly stayed away. Yet numerical
thinking was in vogue-calculation of all kinds was perme­
ating the life of the polity-and it conjured Newton's name
above all others. Mariners, architects, and gamblers were
understood to depend on mathematical methods. Mathe­
matics had become a pillar raising up the glory and honor
of England, "the Academy of the Universe."> John Arbuth­
not published his Essay on the Usefulness of Mathematical
Learning-a study which, he noted, seems to require "a par­
ticular genius and turn of head, ... few are so happy to be
born with." The incomparable Mr. Newton had now dis­
covered "the grand secret of the whole Machine." And he
assured his readers that the world was made of number,
weight, and measure-echoing the Wisdom of Solomon as
well as William Petty, the author of another new tract, Polit­
ical Arithmetick. 6 Petty proposed the application of number
to affairs of state and trade; the word œconomick barely
existed, but he and like-minded scholars were counting what
had not been counted before: populations, life expectancy,
shipping tonnage, and the national income. Political arith­
metic promised wonders, in a technological age:
One Man with a Mill can grind as much Corn, as twenty
can pound in a Mortar; one Printer can make as many
Copies, as an Hundred Men can write by hand; one Horse
can carry upon Wheels, as much as Five upon their Backs;
and in a Boat, or upon Ice, as Twenty."
A decisive technology, and the most venerable example
of standard measure, was the coin. Petty reckoned "the
whole Cash of England" at about six million pounds, circu-
157

ISAAC NEWTON
lating among perhaps six million souls, and by intricate cal­
culation he showed that this was" Mony sufficient to drive
the Trade of the Nation."
By the end of the century, though, England's money
faced a crisis. The silver penny had been the base unit of
value for a millennium; for half that time, the only unit. Now
gold had joined silver in supporting a vivarium of changing
species: groats, shillings, farthings, crowns, guineas. That
grand new coin, the guinea, was supposed to be worth
twenty shillings, but its value fluctuated unpredictably, as
did the price of silver. Untold quantities of English coin
were counterfeit. Even more were shrunken in weight and
value: worn by decades of handling or deliberately trimmed
at the edges by professional clippers, who then made bul­
lion of their accumulated shards. So for thirty years, new
machines, powered by horses and men-the mechanisms
guarded as a state secrets-chad milled a coinage with an
ornamented rim to foil the clippers. A mongrel currency
was the result. Noone would spend a new coin willingly;
these were mostly hoarded or, worse, melted down for ex­
port to France. "Let one money pass throughout the king's
dominion, and that let no man refuse," King Edgar had
said, centralizing England's coinage in the tenth century.
"Let one measure and one weight be used, such as is ob­
served in London." No more. The melting houses and press
rooms of the Mint, just inside the western rampart of the
Tower of London, fell nearly silent as the 1690s began.
Most coins circulating were blurry hammered silver, de­
based, mistrusted, and older than the hands through which
they passed.
The crown called for guidance from eminent citizens,
158

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
Locke, Wren, and Newton among them. Wren proposed
a decimal system; he was ignored. The new Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Charles Montague, set a radical program
in motion: a complete recoinage-all old coins to be with­
drawn from circulation. Montague had known Newton at
Cambridge and with this support the king named him War­
den of the Mint in April 1696, just as the recoinage began.
Newton supervised an urgent industrial project, charcoal
fires burning around the clock, teams of horses and men
crowding in upon one another, garrisoned soldiers standing
watch. It was a tumultuous time at the Tower and in Lon­
don: the terms of the recoinage had strangled the supply of
money essential to daily commerce and, not incidentally,
effected a transfer of national wealth from the poor to the
rich.
Newton grew rich himself, as Warden and then, from
1700 onward, Master. (From his first months he com­
plained to the Treasury about his remuneration," but as
Master he received not only a salary of £500 but also a per­
centage of every pound coined, and these sums were far
greater.) He found a house in Jermyn Street, bought luxu­
rious, mainly crimson furniture.J? engaged servants, and
invited his twenty-year-old niece, Catherine Barton, the
daughter of his half-sister, to live with him as housekeeper.
She became renowned in London society for beauty and
charm. Jonathan Swift was an admirer and frequent visitor.
Within a half-decade she became the lover of Newton's
patron Montague, by now the Earl of Halifax. II
By tradition the Mint posts offered easy income; Mon­
tague had promised Newton "'tis worth five or six hundred
pounds per An, and has not too much bus'nesse to require
159

ISAAC NEWTON
more attendance than you may spare."12 Newton did not
mind treating his professorship as a sinecure-he drew his
Cambridge salary in absentia-but he ran the Mint until his
death, with diligence and even ferocity. He was, after all, the
master of melters and assayers and metallurgists who multi­
plied gold and silver on a scale that alchemists could only
dream of. He wrestled with issues of unformed monetary
theory and international currency.t ' There was nothing
lofty about the requisite arithmetic, yet few could have per­
severed through the intricacies of accounting:
The Assaymasters weights are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12 .... The
weight 12 is about 16 or 20 grains more or less as he
pleases .... His scales turn with the 128th part of a grain,
that is with the 2560th part of the weight 12 which an­
swers to less then the io= part of a penny weight .... The
Melter runs from 600 or 700 to 800 lb of late 1000 lb
weight of silver in a pot & melts 3 potts a day .... The pots
shrink in the fire . . . 4 Millers, 12 horses two Horskeep­
ers, 3 Cutters, 2 Flatters, 8 sizers one Nealer, thre Blanch­
ers, two Markers, two Presses with fourteen labourers to
pull them .... 14
In pursuing clippers and counterfeiters, he called on
long-nurtured reserves of Puritan anger and righteousness.
False coinage was a capital crime, high treason. Jane Hous­
den and Mary Pitman, for example, were condemned (but
pardoned) after having been caught with coining tools and
trying to escape by dropping a parcel of counterfeit money
into the Thames.!? Newton often opposed such pardons.
Counterfeiting was difficult to prove; he had himself made a
160

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
Justice of the Peace and oversaw prosecutions himself, all
the way to the gallows. William Chaloner not only coined
his own guineas but tried to cover his tracks by accusing the
Mint of making its own false money. Newton, managing a
network of agents and prison informers, ensured that he
was hanged. He ignored the convict's final plea:
Some body must have lost something to prove the Thiefe
Some person robbd to prove the highwayman ... Save me
from being murthered 0 Dear Sr do this mercifull deed 0
my offending you has brought this upon me ... 0 God my
God I shall be murderd unless you wave me 0 I hope God
will move your heart with mercy and piny .... 16
Newton did not consider the uttering of bad money to
be a victimless crime; he took it personally. For that matter,
the crown held the Master of the Mint responsible for the
weight and purity of its coinage, subject to enormous fines.
At intervals he underwent the so-called Trial of the Pyx,
named for the official coin chest, the pyx, protected by
three independent locks and keys. A jury of the Goldsmiths'
Company would test select coins "by fire, by water by
touch, or by weight or by all or by any of them," Newton
noted in a memorandum he drafted and redrafted eight
times.!? Then, with solemn ceremony, it would present the
King's Council with the verdict. Newton prepared carefully
for these trials, carrying out his own assays. They showed
that he had brought the standardization of England's coins
to new heights of exactness. For the coronation of Queen
Anne, in 1702, he manufactured medals of gold and silver,
for which he billed the Treasury, twice, precisely £2,485
161

185. 3�d.18 It was three years later, by Her Majesty's Special
Grace, that he was knighted.
A portent of future trouble came from Leibniz, by second
hand: "to Mr. Newton, that man of great mind, my most
devoted greeting" -and "another matter, not only did I rec­
ognize that the most profound Newton's Method of Flux­
ions was like my differential method, but I said so ... and
I also informed others." 19 In passing this on, the elderly
mathematician John Wallis begged Newton to let some of
his treasure out from the darkness. Newton was seen now as
the curator of a hoard of knowledge, its extent unknown.
Wallis told Newton he owed to the public his hypothesis of
light and color, which Wallis knew he had suppressed for
more than thirty years, and much more-a full optical trea­
tise. "You say, you dare not yet publish it," Wallis argued.
"And why not yet? Or, if not now, when then? You adde,
lest I create you some trouble. What trouble now, more
then at another time? ... Mean while, you loose the Repu­
tation of it, and we the Benefit."
His return to the Royal Society had waited, all these
years, for Hooke's exit. Hooke died in March 1703; within
months Newton was chosen president. Past presidents had
often been honorary, political figures. Newton seized power
now and exercised it authoritatively. He quickly named his

the selection of council members. He shored up the soci­
ety's sagging finances, in part from his own pocket. He
162

imposed a rule that the royal mace be displayed when and
only when he was presiding.
With Hooke dead, he also finally took Wallis's advice and
released for publication his second great work-in English,
rather than Latin.>' and, more important, in prose rather
than mathematics. This time he needed no editor. He had
three "books" based on his work from thirty years earlier on
the nature of light and color: the geometry of reflection and
refraction; how lenses form images; and the workings of the
eye and the telescope. The origin of whiteness; prisms; the
rainbow. He added much more, in the form of "Queries":
queries on heat; queries on the ether; occult qualities,
action at a distance, inertia. For good measure he included
a pair of mathematical papers, the first he ever published.
He titled the book Opticks-or, a Treatise on the Reflexions,
Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light. He presented it to
the Royal Society with an "Advertisement" in which he
explained why he had suppressed this work since 1675. The
reason: "To avoid being engaged in Disputes."22
Not only had Hooke died but the world had changed.
Newton's style, integrating theories with mathematical
experimentation, had become familiar to philosophers, and
they accepted readily the same propositions that had stirred
skepticism and scorn in the 167 Os. In the Opticks Newton
described his experiments vividly and revealed far more of
his working style-at least, a plausible working style-than
in the Principia. He leaped across optical wonders as across
stepping stones: from the trigonometry of refraction to the
use of spectacles and mirrors; from thin transparent plates
to bubbles; from the composition of the rainbow to the
refraction of crystals. Much of the available data was raw
163

ISAAC NEWTON
and imprecise, but he shrank from nothing: friction, heat,
putrefaction; the emission of light when bodies burn and
when their parts vibrate. He considered the mysterious
property called "electricity" -a vapor, or fluid, or vital force
that seemed to arise from the excitation of glass, or cloth, as
in his 1675 experiment with bits of paper.
But was light to be understood as waves or particles? He
still believed, hypothetically, that light was a stream of
material particles, but he explored wavy-seeming phenom­
ena, too: "Do not rays of light move sometimes like an eel?"
With Hooke buried, Newton also buried the ether as a
medium that might vibrate with light waves, as a pond car­
ries waves when struck by a stone. Such an ether would
interfere with the planets' permanent motion, otherwise so
perfectly established now.
He was committed to his corpuscular theory: that rays of
light are "very small Bodies emitted from shining Sub­
stances."23 Thus he seemed to take a wrong turn: over the
next two centuries, researchers thrived by treating light as
waves, choosing smoothness over granularity in their fun­
damental view of energy. The mathematical treatment of
colors depended on wavelength and frequency. Until, that
is, Einstein showed that light comes in quanta after all. Yet
it was Newton, more than any other experimenter, who
established the case for light waves. With an accuracy meas­
ured in hundredths of an inch, he had studied colored rings
in thin films.>' He found it impossible to understand this as
anything but a form of periodicity-oscillation or vibration.
Diffraction, too, showed unmistakable signs of periodicity.
He could neither reconcile these signs with his corpuscular
theory nor omit them from his record. He could not see
164

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
how a particle could be a wave, or embody waviness. He
resorted to an odd word: fits, as in "fits of easy reflection"
and "fits of easy transmission." "Probably it is put into such
fits at its first emission from luminous bodies, and contin­
ues in them during all its progress. For these Fits are of a
lasting nature."25
Opticks stretched to cosmology and metaphysics-the
more as Newton extended it in new printings. He could
speak with authority now. He used his pulpit to issue a man­
ifesto. He repeated again and again these dicta: that nature is
consonant; that nature is simple; that nature is conformable
to herself." Complexity can be reduced to order; the laws
can be found. Space is an infinite void. Matter is composed
of atoms-hard and impenetrable. These particles attract
one another by unknown forces: "It is the Business of exper­
imental Philosophy to find them out."27 He was charging his
heirs and followers with a mission, the perfection of natural
philosophy. He left them a task of further study, "the Inves­
tigation of difficult Things by the Method of Analysis."28
They need only follow the signs and the method.
As President of the Royal Society he employed two new
Curators of Experiments.>' Sometimes he had them demon­
strate or extend features of the Principia-once, for exam­
ple, dropping lead weights and inflated hogs' bladders from
a church tower-but more often he tried to spur experi­
ments on light, heat, and chemistry. One line of experi­
ments explored the electric effluvium, creating a luminous
glow, for example, in a glass tube rubbed with cloth, and
testing the tube's attractive power with a feather. Some
spirit, it seemed, could penetrate glass, move small objects,
and emit light-but what? In revising the Opticks he drafted
165

ISAAC NEWTON
new "Queries": for example, "Do not all bodies therefore
abound with a very subtle, but active, potent, electric spirit
by which light is emitted, refracted, & reflected, electric
attractions and fugations are performed ... ?"30 He sup­
pressed these; even so, the trail of electrical research in the
next century seemed to lead back to the Opticks.
"I have only begun the analysis of what remains to be dis­
cover'd," he wrote, "hinting several things about it, and
leaving the Hints to be examin'd and improv'd by the far­
ther Experiments and Observations of such as are inquisi­
tive.">' Active principles-shades of alchemy-remained to
be found out: the cause of gravity, of fermentation, of life
itself. Only such active principles could explain the persist­
ence and variety of motion, the constant heating of the sun
and the inward parts of the earth. Only such principles
stand between us and death. "If it were not for these Princi­
ples," he wrote,
the Earth, Planets, Comets, Sun, and all things in them,
would grow cold and freeze, and become inactive Masses;
and all Putrefaction, Generation, Vegetation and Life
would cease. 32
Word of the Opticks spread slowly through Europe; then
a bit faster after a Latin edition appeared in 1706.33 Father
Nicolas Malebranche, aging theologian and Cartesian,
reviewed the Opticks with the remark, "Though Mr. New­
ton is no physicist, his book is very interesting ... "34 Rivals
who had never managed to dispute his mathematics found
new opportunities in his metaphysics. He had spoken of
infinite space as the "sensorium" of God, by which he
meant to unify omnipresence and omniscience. God, being
166

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
everywhere, is immediately and perfectly aware. But the dif­
ficult word, suggesting a bodily organ for divine sensation,
left him vulnerable to theological counterattack: "I exam­
ined it and laughed at the idea," Leibniz told Bernoulli­
these eminent admirers now turned enemies of Newton.
"As if God, from whom everything comes, should have
need of a sensorium. This man has little success with Meta­
physics."35 And again Leibniz abhorred Newton's vacuum.
A world of vast emptiness-unacceptable. Planets attract­
ing one another across this emptiness-absurd. He objected
to Newton's conception of absolute space as a reference
frame for analyzing motion, and he mocked the idea of grav­
itation. For one body to curve round another, with nothing
pushing or impelling it-impossible. Even supernatural. "I
say, it could not be done without a miracle."36
By now he and Newton were in open conflict. Leibniz,
four years Newton's junior, had seen far more of the
world-a stoop-shouldered, tireless man of affairs, lawyer
and diplomat, cosmopolitan traveler, courtier to the House
of Hanover. The two men had exchanged their first let­
ters-probing and guarded-in the late 1670s. In the realm
of mathematics, it was paradoxically difficult to stake effec­
tive claims to knowledge without disclosure. One long letter
from Newton, for Leibniz via Oldenburg, asserted posses­
sion of a "twofold" method for solving inverse problems of
tangents "and others more difficult" and then concealed
the methods in code:
At present I have thought fit to register them both by trans­
posed letters ... 5accdcelOeffhl1i413m9n6oqqr8s11t9v3x:

Communicating with Leibniz: The key to the cryptogram.
He retained the key in a dated "memorandum" to himself.
Still, impenetrable though this cryptogram was, Newton
had shown Leibniz powerful methods: the binomial theo­
rem, the use of infinite series, the drawing of tangents, and
the finding of maxima and minima.
Leibniz, in his turn, chose not to acknowledge these
when, in 1684 and 1686, he published his related mathe­
matical work as "A New Method for Maxima and Minima,
and Also for Tangents, Which Stops at Neither Fractions
nor Irrational Quantities, and a Singular Type of Calculus
for These" in the new German journal Acta Eruditorum. He
offered rules for computing derivatives and integrals, and
an innovative notation: dx, f(x), Jx. This was a pragmatic
mathematics, a mathematics without proof, an algorithm
for solving "the most difficult and most beautiful prob­
lems."38 With this new name, calculus, it traveled slowly
toward England, just before word of the Principia, with its
classic geometrical style concealing new tools of analysis,
made its way across the Continent.
168

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
Now, decades later, Newton had a purpose in publish­
ing his pair of mathematical papers with the Opticks, and
he made his purpose plain. In particular, "On the Quadra­
ture of Curves" laid out for the first time his method offlux­
ions. In effect, despite the utterly different notation, this
was Leibniz's differential calculus. Where Leibniz worked
with successive differences, Newton spoke of rates of flow
changing through successive moments of time. Leibniz
was chunklets-discrete bits. Newton was the continuum.
A deep understanding of the calculus ultimately came to de­
mand a mental bridge from one to the other, a translation
and reconciliation of two seemingly incompatible symbolic
systems.
Newton declared not only that he had made his discover­
ies by 1666 but also that he had described them to Leibniz.
He released the correspondence, anagrams and all."? Soon
an anonymous counterattack appeared in Acta Eruditorum
suggesting that Newton had employed Leibniz's methods,
though calling them "fluxions" instead of "Leibnizian dif­
ferences." This anonymous reviewer was Leibniz. Newton's
disciples fired back in the Philosophical Transactions) suggest­
ing that it was Leibniz who, having read Newton's descrip­
tion of his methods, then published "the same Arithmetic
under a different name and using a different notation.":'?
Between each of these thrusts and parries, years passed.
But a duel was under way. Partisans joined both sides, en­
couraged by tribal loyalties more than any real knowledge
of the documentary history. Scant public record existed on
either side.
The principals joined the fray openly in 1 711. A furious
letter from Leibniz arrived at the Royal Society, where it
was read aloud and "deliver'd to the President to consider
169

ISAAC NEWTON
the contents thereof."41 The society named a committee
to investigate "old letters and papers."42 Newton provided
these. Early correspondence with John Collins came to light;
Leibniz had seen some of it, all those years before. The
committee produced a document without precedent: a
detailed, analytical history of mathematical discovery. No
clearer account of the calculus existed, but exposition was
not the point; the report was meant as a polemic, to con­
demn Leibniz, accusing him of a whole congeries of pla­
giarisms. It judged Newton's method to be not only the
first-"by many years" -but also more elegant, more natu­
ral, more geometrical, more useful, and more certain.t- It
vindicated Newton with eloquence and passion, and no
wonder: Newton was its secret author.
The Royal Society published it rapidly. It also published
a long assessment of the report, in the Philosophical Transac­
tions-a diatribe, in fact. This, too, was secretly composed
by Newton. Thus he anonymously reviewed his own anony­
mous report, and in doing so he spoke of candor:
It lies upon [Leibniz], in point of Candor, to tell us what
he means by pretending to have found the Method before
he had found it.
It lies upon him, in point of Candor, to make us under­
stand that he pretended to this Antiquity of his Invention
with some other Design than to rival and supplant Mr.
Newton.
When he wrote those Tracts he was but a Learner, and this
he ought in candour to acknowledge.
170

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
He declared righteously: "no Man is a Witness in his own
Cause. A Judge would be very unjust, and act contrary to
the Laws of all Nations, who should admit any Man to be a
Witness in his own Cause."44
Newton wrote many private drafts about Leibniz, often
the same ruthless polemic again and again, varying only
by a few words. The priority dispute spilled over into the
philosophical disputes, the Europeans sharpening their ac­
cusation that his theories resorted to miracles and occult
qualities. What reasoning, what causes, should be permit­
ted? In defending his claim to first invention of the calculus,
Newton stated his rules for belief, proposing a framework by
which his science-any science-ought to be judged. Leib­
niz observed different rules. In arguing against the miracu­
lous, the German argued theologically. By pure reason,
for example, he argued from the perfection of God and
the excellence of his workmanship to the impossibility of
the vacuum and of atoms. He accused Newton-and this
stung-of implying an imperfect God.
Newton had tied knowledge to experiments. Where ex­
periments could not reach, he had left mysteries explicitly
unsolved. This was only proper, yet the Germans threw it
back in his face: "as if it were a Crime to content himself
with Certainties and let Uncertainties alone."
"These two Gentlemen differ very much in Philosophy,"
Newton declared under cover of anonymity.
The one teaches that Philosophers are to argue from
Phœnomena and Experiments to the Causes thereof, and
thence to the Causes of those Causes, and so on till we
come to the first Cause; the other that all the Actions of
171

ISAAC NEWTON
the first Cause are Miracles, and all the Laws imprest on
Nature by the Will of God are perpetual Miracles and
occult Qualities, and therefore not to be considered in Phi­
losophy. But must the constant and universal Laws of
Nature, if derived from the Power of God or the Action of
a Cause not yet known to us, be called Miracles and occult
Qualitiesr+?
Newton understood the truth full well: that he and Leib­
niz had created the calculus independently. Leibniz had not
been altogether candid about what he had learned from
Newton-in fragments, and through proxies-but the es­
sence of the invention was his. Newton had made his dis­
coveries first, and he had discovered more, but Leibniz had
done what Newton had not: published his work for the
world to use and to judge. It was secrecy that spawned com­
petition and envy. The plagiarism controversy drew its heat
from the gaps in the dissemination of knowledge. In a young
and suddenly fertile field like the mathematics of the seven­
teenth century, discoveries had lain waiting to be found
again and again by different people in different places.:"
The Newton-Leibniz duel continued long after the
deaths of the protagonists. It constricted the development of
English mathematics, as orthodoxy hardened around New­
ton's dot notation.s? The more historians came to under­
stand what happened, the uglier it looked. No one could
dispute Lenore Feigenbaum's simple précis: "Grown men,
brilliant and powerful, betrayed their friends, lied shame­
lessly to their enemies, uttered hateful chauvinistic slurs,
and impugned each others' characters.t'Y Newton's rage,
Leibniz's bitterness-the darkest emotions of these proto­
scientists almost overshadowed their shared achievement.
172

NO MAN IS A WITNESS IN HIS OWN CAUSE
Yet the priority dispute contributed to the transition of
science from private obsessions to public enterprise. It
exposed texts that Newton had meant to keep hidden and
concentrated the interest of philosophers in these new
methods: their richness, their fungibility, their power. The
competition between formalisms-superficially so differ­
ent-brought into focus the shared underlying core.
The obsessions of Newton's later years disappointed
modernity in some way. Later Newtonians came to find
them as troubling as his pursuit of alchemy and biblical
prophecy, if not for quite the same reasons. Just when sci­
ence began to coalesce as an English institution, Newton
made himself its autocrat. He purged the Royal Society of
all remnants of Hooke. He gained authority over the Obser­
vatory and wrested from Flamsteed the astronomer's own
life's work, a comprehensive catalogue of the stars. (Flam­
steed, summoned to appear before Newton, "complained
then of my catalogue being printed by Halley, without my
knowledge, and that I was robbed of the fruits of my labors.
At this he fired, and called me all the ill names, puppy &c.
that he could think of."!") D. T. Whiteside, who became the
twentieth century's preeminent scholar and shepherd of
Newton's mathematical work, could not but remark:
Only too few have ever possessed the intellectual genius
and surpassing capacity to stamp their image upon the
thought of their age and that of centuries to follow. Watch­
ing over the minting of a nation's coin, catching a few
counterfeiters, increasing an already respectably sized per­
sonal fortune, being a political figure, even dictating to
one's fellow scientists: it should all seem a crass and empty
ambition once you have written a Principia.
173

ISAAC NEWTON
Still, it did not seem so to Newton.>? He had been a man on
God's mission, seeking his secrets, interpreting his design,
but he had never meant to draw philosophers to his side. He
had not meant to lead a cult or a school. Nevertheless he
had gathered disciples and enemies as well. Leibniz never
stopped hoping for a moral victory. Adieu) he wrote. "Adieu
the vacuum, the atoms, and the whole Philosophy of M.
Newton.">!
Leibniz died in 1 716, having spent his last years at
Hanover as librarian to the Duke. Newton's death was still
to come.

The Marble Index of a Mind
NEWS CAME SWIFTLY from far and exotic lands. Philo­
sophical Transactions reported the discovery of "Phillip­
pine-Islands" and "Hottentots."! Thus inspired, in 1726 a
Fleet Street printer produced a volume of Travels into Sev­
eral Remote Nations of the WOrld) by one Captain Lemuel
Gulliver, describing wonderful peoples: Yahoos and Brob­
dingnagians. At length Gulliver's travels brought him to
Glubbdubdrib, the island of sorcerers, where he heard the
ancients and the moderns compare their histories.? Aristo­
tle appeared, with lank hair and meager visage, confessed
his mistakes, noted that Descartes's vortices were also soon
"to be exploded," and offered up some epistemological rel­
ativism:
He predicted the same fate to ATTRACTION, whereof the
present learned are such zealous asserters. He said, "that
new systems of nature were but new fashions, which would
vary in every age; and even those, who pretend to demon­
strate them from mathematical principles, would flourish
but a short period of time, and be out of vogue when that
was determined."
175

ISAAC NEWTON
The shade of Aristotle might think so. Never had human
cosmologies come and gone so rapidly, the new sweeping
aside the old in scarcely a lifetime. Jonathan Swift had
no reason to know that Newton's would be the one to
endure.
•
It scarcely mattered, Voltaire said cynically. Hardly any-
one knew how to read, and of these few, hardly any read
philosophy. "The number of those who think is exceedingly
small, and they are not interested in upsetting the world.">
Nevertheless, captivated by Newtonianism, he began to
spread the word in his own writing-popular science and
myth-making. He told the story of the apple, which he had
heard from Newton's niece. "The labyrinth and abyss of
infinity is another new journey undertaken by Newton and
he has given us the thread with which we can find our way
through." And he defended Newton from the many French
accusers, "learned or not," who complained of his replacing
familiar impulsion with mysterious attraction. He conjured a
reply in Newton's voice:
You no more understand the word impulsion than you
do the word attraction, and if you cannot grasp why one
body tends towards the centre of another, you cannot
imagine any the more by what virtue one body can push
another .... I have discovered a new property of matter,
one of the secrets of the Creator. I have calculated and
demonstrated its effects; should people quibble with me
over the name I give it? 4
Other memorialists of Newton in England and Europe
put on record personal details, of a certain kind. The great
man had clear eyesight and all his teeth but one. He had kept
176

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
a head of pure white hair. He remained gentle and modest,
treasuring quiet and disliking squabbles. He never laughed­
except once, when asked what use in life was reading Euclid,
"upon which Sir Isaac was very merry." He had died, from a
stone in his bladder, after hours of agony, sweat rolling from
his forehead, but he had never cried out or complained."
In England, where new popular gazettes carried curiosi­
ties to the countryside, the death of Newton inspired a
decade-long outpouring of verse, patriotic and lyrical. He
was after all the philosopher of light. Elegists seemed to give
him credit for all the colors he had found in his prism, flam­
ing red, tawny orange, deepened indigo. Richard Lovatt
posted a poem to the Ladies Diary in 1 733:
... mighty Newton the Foundation laid,
Of his Mysterious Art ...
Great Britain's sons will long his works pursue.
By curious Theorems he the Moon cou'd trace
And her true Motion give in every Place."
A hero, an English hero, and a new kind of hero, brandish­
ing no sword but "curious theorems." The connection
between knowledge and power had been made. Not all
forms of knowledge were equal: the Gentleman's Magazine
complained about schools "where the two chief branches
of Knowledge inculcated are French and Dancing," but
reported with pleasure that a medal honoring Newton had
been struck at the Tower." More poetry followed; an enthu­
siast could bring off a paean in just two lines:
Newton's no more-By Silence Grief's exprest:
Lo here he lies; His World proclaim the rest."
177

ISAAC NEWTON
Alexander Pope's couplet found more readers:
Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;
God said, Let Newton be! And All was Light."
Public lectures and traveling demonstrations went where
the written word lacked force. Newton had made claims
that could be tested. By computation he pronounced the
earth oblate, broader at the equator, in contrast to the egg­
shaped Cartesian earth. In 1733 the French Academy of
Sciences proposed to settle the matter and dispatched expe­
ditions northward to Lapland and southward to Peru with
quadrants, telescopes, and twenty-foot wooden rods. When
the voyagers returned-a decade later-they brought meas­
urements supporting Newton's view. Mastery of the stars
and planets empowered the nation's ships as much as the
wind did. Halley showed by example what it meant to
believe in N ewtonianism. He made dramatic public predic­
tions, computing the path of a certain comet and prophesy­
ing its return every seventy-six years; the forecast in itself
inspired and disturbed the English long before it proved
true. In 1715 Halley anticipated a total solar eclipse by pub­
lishing a broadsheet map showing where and when the
moon's shadow would cross England. The Royal Society
gathered at the appointed moment in a courtyard and on a
rooftop, under a clear sky, where they saw the sudden
untimely nightfall, the sun's corona flaring, and owls, con­
fused, taking to the air. They saw that by predicting celestial
prodigies an astronomer tamed them and drained them of
their terror.!?
As it evolved into a new orthodoxy, N ewtonianism be­
came a target. It was continually being disproved, in tracts
178

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
with titles like Remarks upon the Newtonian philosophy:
wherein the fallacies of the pretended mathematical demonstra­
tions, by which those authors support that philosophy are clearly
laid open: and the philosophy itself fully proved to be false and
absurd both by mathematical and physical demonstration. Il
It inspired satires, some deliberate and some ingenuously
respectful. One Newtonian convert, the vicar of Gillingham
Major, wrote a treatise called Theologies Christiana: Principia
Mathematica, calculating that the probability of counterevi­
dence to the Gospels diminished with time and would reach
zero in the year 3144. A Viennese physician, Franz Mesmer,
"discovered" animal magnetism or animal gravity, a healing
principle based (so he claimed) on Newtonian principles.
He named it after himself: Mesmerism.
But Newtonianism was not yet a word, in English.'? In
Italy, an instructive little tract appeared with the title Il
Newtonianismo per Ie Dame, quickly rendered into French
and then English as Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy Explain'd
for the Use of the Ladies, in six dialogues, vivid and heroic. It
employed the inverse-square law to calculate the power of
attraction between separated lovers. And the philosopher
wielded a sword after all: "Thus Sir Isaac Newton, the
avowed Enemy to imaginary Systems, and to whom you are
indebted for the true idea of Philosophy, has at one Blow
lopped off the two principal Heads of the reviving Cartesian
Hydra."13
That heroic style went out of vogue soon enough. Now
poets do not glorify Newton, but they can love him, or his
legend. "Maybe he made up the apple, / Maybe not," ven­
tures Elizabeth Socolow:
179

ISAAC NEWTON
I see the way he thirsted all his life
to find the force that seemed not to be there,
but acted, and precisely.!"
For centuries between, the poets doubted him and even
demonized him-his calculating spirit, his icy rationality,
his plundering of the mysteries they owned. Then Newton
was created as much by his enemies as his friends.
Keats and Wordsworth joined the Romantic artist Ben­
jamin Haydon at dinner on a bleak December night in 1817
in his painting-room.'> He showed them his broad, unfin­
ished canvas of Christ's Entry into Jerusalem; in the crowd of
Christ's followers he had painted the face of Newton. Keats
ragged him for that and proposed a sardonic toast: "N ew­
ton's health, and confusion to mathematics." Newton had
unweaved the rainbow with his prism. He had reduced
nature to philosophy; had made knowledge a "dull cata­
logue of common things"; had tried to "conquer all myster­
ies by rule and line."16 Shelley complained that, to Newton,
Those mighty spheres that gem infinity
Were only specks of tinsel fixed in heaven
To light the midnights of his native town! 17
He could not acknowledge that it was Newton for whom
the stars had grown to mighty spheres. Wordsworth, too,
had an image in mind, cold yet majestic. He saw at Trinity
College a statue in the moon's light:
Newton with his prism and silent face,
The marble index of a mind for ever
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone. IS
180

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
Loathing Newton most profoundly was the myth-maker
William Blake, poet, engraver, and visionary. Blake was
born to hate Newton. He loathed him and revered him.
When he drew Newton he pictured a demigod, naked and
muscular, with golden locks and keen hands. But he also
saw an enemy of imagination: the lawmaker and repressor­
"unknown, abstracted, brooding, secret, the dark Power
hid."!? Like Leibniz and the Cartesians he feared Newton's
vacuum; unlike them, he believed in it: "this abominable
Void, this soul-shudd'ring Vacuum." He blamed Newton
for perfection and rigidity. He blamed him for his very suc­
cess as a truthseeker. "God forbid that Truth should be
Confined to Mathematical Demonstration.">' He blamed
him for departing from the particular by abstraction and
generalization. He blamed him for the reason that trumps
181

ISAAC NEWTON
imagination, and he blamed him for finding knowledge by
way of doubt:
Reason says Miracle; Newton says Doubt
Aye thats the way to make all nature out
Doubt Doubt & dont believe without experiment.ê!
He blamed him for the part he had played-the Romantics
began to see this-in the graying of Eden, the industrializa­
tion and mechanization; factories dimming the air with
smoke. Dark Satanic mills. "The Water-wheels of Newton,"
Blake cried:
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs
tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden,
which
Wheel within Wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony &
peace."22
Newton had given, and he had taken away. He gave a
sense of order, security, and lawfulness. The American
Declaration of Independence found N ewtonianism, via
Locke, and threw it back at the British by citing the laws of
nature in its opening sentence. He gave infinite space yet
took away the plenitude, for with infinity came the void. He
took away mystery, and for some that meant godliness. An
ad hoc universe had also been a providential universe.
He was made in myth, this Newton of the poets. No one
tried reading the vast storehouse of paper that survived
him. The manuscripts, fragmentary drafts, scraps of calcu-
182

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
lation and speculation, all lay through the generations In
the private storerooms of English aristocratic families. The
anti-Trinitarian heresies were rumored but still secret. A
full century passed before anyone attempted a real biogra­
phy: the pious David Brewster, who in 1831 honored the
nobility of Newton's genius, emphasized his simplicity,
humility, and benevolence, and, though he had seen some
of the disturbing manuscripts, declared firmly, "There is no
reason to suppose that Sir Isaac Newton was a believer in
the doctrines of alchemy."23
Brewster also stayed clear of the apple, though he had
heard the story and paid a visit to the surviving tree at
Woolsthorpe. It remained for the poets to ensure the apple's
place in the Newton legend. They knew the apple's ancient
pull: sin and knowledge; knowledge and inspiration. "Man
fell with apples, and with apples rose," Byron wrote-
for we must deem the mode
In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
A thing to counterbalance human woes;
For ever since immortal man hath glowed
With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
Steam-engines will conduct him to the Moon.>'
Success bred confidence. Law triumphed. Newton's follow­
ers and successors created a more perfect N ewtonianism
than his own, striving for extremes of rational determinism.
In post-Revolutionary France, Pierre Simon de Laplace
reexpressed Newton's mechanics in a form suitable for
183

ISAAC NEWTON
modern field theories-rates of change as gradients and
potentials-and then reached for another kind of philoso­
pher's stone. He imagined a supreme intelligence, a perfect
computer, armed with data representing the positions and
forces of all things at one instant. It need only apply N ew­
ton's laws: "Such an intelligence would embrace in the
same formula the motions of the greatest bodies of the uni­
verse and those of the lightest atom; nothing would be
uncertain, and the future, like the past, would be present to
its eyes."
Philosophers no longer claim him as one of their own.
Philosophy absorbed him, beginning with Immanuel Kant,
who turned the German tide against Leibniz and his chains
of reasoning, theistic proofs, circles of words. Kant saw
science as specially successful, knowledge that begins with
experience. He brought space and time into epistemology;
space as magnitude, empty or not; time as another kind
of infinitude; both existing outside ourselves, eternal and
subsistent. To explore how we know anything, we begin
with our knowledge of these absolutes. Yet afterward, New­
ton became a quaint figure for philosophers. When Edwin
Arthur Burtt wrote his 1924 Metaphysical Foundations of
Modern Physical Science, he first assigned those foundations
to Newton and then said, without irony: "In scientific dis­
covery and formulation Newton was a marvelous genius; as
a philosopher he was uncritical, sketchy, inconsistent, even
second-rate." He added in passing, "It has, no doubt, been
worth the metaphysical barbarism of a few centuries to
possess modern science."25
The Principia marked a fork in the road: thenceforth sci­
ence and philosophy went separate ways. Newton had re-
184

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
moved from the realm of metaphysics many questions about
the nature of things-about what exists-and assigned them
to a new realm, physics. "This preparation being made," he
declared, "we argue more safely."26 And less safely, too: by
mathematizing science, he made it possible for its facts
and claims to be proved wrong.ê? This vulnerability was its
strength. By the early nineteenth century Georges Cuvier
was asking enviously, "Should not natural history also one
day have its Newton?" By the early twentieth, social scien­
tists, economists, and biologists, too, were longing for a
Newton of their own-or for the unattainable mirage of
Newtonian perfection.ê"
Then science seemed to reject that same perfection: the
absolutes and the determinism. The relativity of Einstein
appeared as a revolutionary assault on absolute space and
time. Motion distorts the flow of time and the geometry of
space, he found. Gravity is not just a force, ineffable, but
also a curvature of space-time itself. Mass, too, had to be
redefined; it became interchangeable with energy.ê? George
Bernard Shaw declared to radio listeners that N ewtonian­
ism had been a religion, and now it had "crumpled up and
was succeeded by the Einstein universe.Y'? T. S. Kuhn, in
asserting his famous theory of scientific revolutions, said
that Einstein had returned science to problems and beliefs
"more like those of Newton's predecessors than of his suc­
cessors.">' These, too, were myths.
We understand space and time, force and mass, in the
Newtonian mode, long before we study them or read about
them. Einstein did shake space-time loose from pins to
which Newton had bound it, but he lived in Newton's
space-time nonetheless: absolute in its geometrical rigor
185

ISAAC NEWTON
and its independence of the world we see and feel. He hap­
pily brandished the tools Newton had forged. Einstein's is
no everyday or psychological relativity." "Let no one sup­
pose," he said in 1919, "that the mighty work of Newton
can really be superseded by this or any other theory. His
great and lucid ideas will retain their unique significance
for all time as the foundation of our whole modern concep­
tual structure in the sphere of natural philosophy."33 The
observer whom Einstein and his followers returned to sci­
ence scarcely resembled the observer whom Newton had
removed. That medieval observer had been careless and
vague; time was an accumulation of yesterdays and tomor­
rows, slow and fast, nothing to be measured or relied upon.
Time and space had first to be rescued-made absolute,
true, and mathematical: The common people conceive those
quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear
to sensible objects. Sensible meant crude-wooden measur­
ing sticks and clocks that told only the hour. And thence arise
certain prejudices for the removing of which it will be convenient
to distinguish them into absolute and relative) true and apparent)
mathematical and common. The day, as measured by succes­
sive southings of the sun, varied in length; philosophy
needed an unqualified measure. It was not only convenient
but necessary, in creating physics, to abstract this pure
sense of time and space. Even so, Newton left openings for
the relativists who followed three centuries behind. It may
be) that there is no such thing as an equable motion) whereby time
may be accurately measured) he wrote. It may be that there is no
body really at rest) to which the places and motions of others may
be referred. 34
His insistence on a particle view of light did not lead to
186

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
the modern quantum theory, even if, in some sense, it
proved correct. It was Einstein who discovered the equiva­
lence of mass and energy; still, Newton suspected their
organic unity: "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible
into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their
Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Com­
position?"35 He never spoke offields afforce, but field theo­
ries were born in his view of gravitational and magnetic
forces distributed about a center: "an endeavor of the whole
directed toward a center, ... a certain efficacy diffused from
the center through each of the surrounding places."36 New­
ton also anticipated the existence of subatomic forces by
rejecting alternative explanations for the cohesion of mat­
ter: "some have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging
the Question." Let others resort to occult qualities. "I had
rather infer from their Cohesion, that their Particles attract
one another by some Force, which in immediate Contact is
exceeding strong.">? He speculated that such a force­
another force, independent of gravity, magnetism, and elec­
tricity-might prevail only at the smallest distances.
The infinities, the void, the laws must endure-not a
fashion, not reversible. We internalize the essence of what
he learned. A few general principles give rise to all the myr­
iad properties and actions of things. The universe's building
blocks and laws are everywhere the same. 38
No one feels the burden of Newton's legacy, looming for­
ward from the past, more than the modern scientist. A
worry nags at his descendants: that Newton may have been
too successful; that the power of his methods gave them too
much authority. His solution to celestial dynamics was so
thorough and so precise-scientists cannot help but seek
187

ISAAC NEWTON
the same exactness everywhere. "A slightly naughty thought
can come to one's mind here," said Hermann Bondi. "The
tools that he gave us stand at the root of so much that goes
on now .... We may not be doing a lot more than following
in his footsteps. We may still be so much under the impres­
sion of the particular turn he took ... we cannot get it out of
our system."39 We cannot. What Newton learned entered
the marrow of what we know without knowing how we
know it.
His papers began to appear in the early twentieth century,
when cash-poor nobility sold them at auction and they scat­
tered to collectors in Europe and across the Atlantic. In
1936 Viscount Lymington, a descendant of Catherine Bar­
ton, sent Sotheby's a metal trunk containing manuscripts of
three million words, to be broken up and offered at auction
in 329 lots. Interest was slight.w but the economist and
Cantabrigian John Maynard Keynes, disturbed, as he said,
by the impiety, managed to buy some at the auction and
then gradually reassembled more than a third of the collec­
tion. What he found there amazed him: the alchemist; the
heretical theologian; not the cold rationalist Blake had so
despised but a genius more peculiar and extraordinary. An
"intense and flaming spirit." With the papers Keynes also
bought Newton's death mask-eyeless, scowling. At least
twenty portraits of Newton had been painted, not all from
life; they differ extravagantly, one from another.
"N ewton was not the first of the age of reason," Keynes
told a few students and fellows in a shadowed room at Trin­
ity College. "He was the last of the magicians, the last of
the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which
188

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the
same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inher­
itance rather less than 10,000 years ago."41 The Newton of
tradition, the "Sage and Monarch of the Age of Reason,"
had to arise later.
189

ISAAC NEWTON
He had concealed so much, till the very end. As his
health declined, he kept writing. His niece's new husband,
John Conduitt, saw him in his last days working in near
darkness on an obsessional history of the world-he wrote
at least a dozen drafts- The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms
Amended.ï? He measured the reigns of kings and the gener­
ations of Noah, used astronomical calculations to date the
sailing of the Argonauts, and declared the ancient kingdoms
to be hundreds of years younger than generally supposed.
He incorporated his analysis of the Temple of Solomon and
said enough about idolatry and the deification of kings to
raise suspicion of his heretical beliefs, but he suppressed
those one last time.
In his chambers, after a painful fit of gout, he sat with
Conduitt before a wood fire and talked about comets. The
sun needed constant replenishment, he said. Comets must
provide it, feeding the sun like logs thrown on the fire. The
comet of 1680 had come close, and it would return. He
said that on one approach, perhaps after five or six more or­
bits, it would fall into the sun and fuel a blaze to consume
the very earth, and all its inhabitants would perish in the
fiames.t- Yet, Newton said, this was mere conjecture.
He wrote: "To explain all nature is too difficult a task for
anyone man or even for anyone age. Tis much better to do
a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come
after yoU."44 This sheet of paper, too, he abandoned.
On his deathbed he refused the sacrament of the church.
Nor could a pair of doctors ease his pain. He died early
Sunday morning, March 19, 1727. On Thursday the Royal
Society recorded in its Journal Book, "The Chair being
Vacant by the death of Sir Isaac Newton there was no Meet­
ing this Day."
190

THE MARBLE INDEX OF A MIND
His recent forebears had used scriveners to draft wills
directing the disposition of their meager possessions, prin­
cipally sheep. When they did not leave such documents,
even their names vanished. An early chronicler, researching
Newton's story soon after his death, delved into the Wools­
thorpe parish registers of births and burials and found
almost nothing: the information "lost, destroyd, or obliter­
ated; for want of care and due preservation." The national
records, he railed, were "the most neglected! ... committed
to a parish clark, illiterate, that can scarcely write, sottish, or
indolent: a task on which the fortunes and emoluments of
the whole kingdom in a great measure depends." In an old
town chest, a tattered vellum leaf bore this datum under
the heading baptiz d anno 1642: "Isaac sonne of Isaac and
Hanna Newton Jan 1."45
In eighty-four years he had amassed a fortune: household
furniture, much of it upholstered in crimson; crimson cur­
tains, a crimson mohair bed, and crimson cushions; a clock;
a parcel of mathematical instruments and chemical glasses;
several bottles of wine and cider; thirty-nine silver medals
and copies in plaster of Paris; a vast library with nearly two
thousand books and his many secret manuscripts; gold bars
and coins-the whole estate valued at £31,821,46 a consid­
erable legacy.
Yet he left no will.

Notes
A word about dates. In the time with which we are concerned,
the English calendar ran at first ten and then eleven days behind
the calendar in most of Europe. I use the English dates. Mean­
while, the year in England was considered to start March 25, not
January 1. So, for example, when Newton died on March 20,
they reckoned it was 1726 in England but 1727 elsewhere. From
our anachronistic point of view, it was 1 727, so I use the Conti­
nental-modern-years.
A word about language. Mostly I follow the spelling and style
of the original texts. But where Newton (and others) com­
pressed words to "v' ," "weh," "yt," &c., I have modernized the
orthography for the sake of readability.
EPIGRAPH Newton's recollection, the year before he died, of
having made the first reflecting telescope; recorded by his
niece's husband, John Conduitt, memorandum, August 31,

1. "What a lesson to the vanity and presumption of philoso­
phers!" exclaimed his first biographer, Brewster, in 1831
(The Life of Sir Isaac Newton, p. 303). Newton, who read
incessantly and remained unsettled, was echoing Milton
(Paradise Regained, 320-21):
193

Who reads
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not
A spirit and judgment equal or superior,
(And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)
Uncertain and unsettled still remains,
Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,
Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys
And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,
As children gathering pebbles on the shore.

4. Nor did he persuade us quickly. A few years before his death, a
scholarly author could rail against Newton's conception of
gravity ("this Cause, which looks as monstrous as any of the
Fictions of Antiquity") without condescending to use the
word: "That it is a Virtue or Power which Bodies have to attract
or draw one another; that every Particle of Matter has this
Power or Virtue; that it reaches to all Places at all Distances,
and penetrates to the Center of the Sun and Planets; that it
acts not upon the Surfaces of Bodies as other Natural Agents,
but upon their whole Substance or solid Content, &c. and if
so, what a strange Thing must it be." Gordon, Remarks, p. 6.

which are very difficult to understand!" "Newton and the

1. Barnabas Smith was sixty-three and well off; Hannah
Ayscough probably about thirty; their marriage was negoti­
ated by one of the rector's parishioners, for a fee, and by her
brother. It was agreed that Isaac would remain at Woolsthorpe
and that Smith would give him a parcel of land. She brought
to the marriage a parcel with an income of £50.

5. When he was twenty, a student at Trinity College, he suf­
fered a sort of crisis of conscience around Whitsunday and
wrote down-in a private shorthand-a catalogue of his
sins. Among the early sins he included "Threatning my
father and mother Smith to burne them and the house over
them" and "Wishing death and hoping it to some." He also
recalled "peevishness" with his mother and half-sister, strik­
ing his sister and others, "having uncleane thoughts words
and actions and dreamese," and many episodes of lying and
violating the Sabbath ("Thy day"). Westfall, "Short-Writing

10. Eventually he wrote:
"It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover and
effectually to distinguish the true motions of particular
bodies from the apparent, because the parts of that
immovable space in which those motions are per­
formed do by no means come under the observation of
our senses. Yet the thing is not altogether desperate; for
we have some arguments to guide us, partly from the
apparent motions, which are the differences of the true
motions; partly from the forces, which are the causes
and effects of the true motions. For instance, if two
globes, kept at a given distance one from the other by
means of a cord that connects them, were revolved
about their common center of gravity, we might, from
the tension of the cord, discover the endeavor of the
globes to recede from the axis of their motion, and
from thence we might compute the quantity of their
circular motions .... " Principia (Motte), p. 12.

water that a thing moved in it doth carry the same water
behind it ... or at least the water is moved from behind it
with but a small force as you may observe by the motes in

3: TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS BY MOTION
1. Conduitt, "Memorandum relating to Sr Isaac Newton given
me by Mr Demoivre in Novr 1727":
In 63 being at Stourbridge fair bought a book of Astrol­
ogy ... Read in it till he came to a figure of the heavens
which he could not understand for want of being
acquainted with Trigonometry. Bought a book of Trig­
onometry, but was not able to understand the Demon­
strations. Got Euclid to fit himself for understanding
the ground of Trigonometry. Read only the titles of the
propositions, which he found so easy to understand
that he wondered how any body would amuse them­
selves to write any demonstrations of them. Began to
change his mind when he read that Parallelograms
upon the same base & between the same Parallels are
equal, & that other proposition that in a right angled
Triangle the square of the Hypothenuse is equal to the
squares of the other two sides.
Cf.KeynesMS 130.4;andMathI: 15.
2. Thus Whiteside: "We are, too, perhaps a little disappointed
that Newton read so little of standard contemporary mathe­
matical works, or if he did has left no hint-nowhere in his
early autograph papers do we find the names of Napier,
Briggs, Desargue, Fermat, Pascal, Kepler, Torricelli, or
even Archimedes and Barrow." "Sources and Strengths of
Newton's Early Mathematical Thought," in Palter, Annus
Mirabilis, p. 75. Apart from Newton's notes, his second- and
third-hand recollections of his reading, including the "book
200

(Add MS 4007); also Corres VII: 394.
3. Some survived infection, but not many. In Cambridge the
final "Plague Bill" reported a total of 758 deaths from June 5
to January 1, all but nine from the plague. About half that
number were infected and recovered. Leedham-Green, Con­
cise History, p. 74.
4. This is the only surviving letter either to or from Newton's
mother (or, for that matter, any close relative). The edges
are torn and some words are missing. Corres I: 2.
5. Add MS 4004.
6. The "year"-traditionally seen by Newtonians as the annus
mirabilis-covered eighteen or twenty or twenty-five months.
Sophisticated Newtonians sometimes prefer to speak of the
"myth" of the annus mirabilis. For example, Derek Gjertsen
debunks the myth sternly: "The description is clearly mis-
leading, for no special priority can be given to either
1665 or 1666 It remains true, none the less, and without
too much exaggeration, that in a remarkably short period
the twenty-four-year-old student created modern mathe­
matics, mechanics, and optics. There is nothing remotely
like it in the history of thought." Gjertsen, Newton Hand­
book� p. 24. Cf. Whiteside ("Newton the Mathematician," in
Bechler, Contemporary Newtonian Research, p. 115): "Never
did seventeenth-century man build up so great a store of
mathematical expertise, much of his own discovery, in so
short a time."
Anyway, Newton's stay in Woolsthorpe extended over
about twenty months, broken by a temporary return to
Cambridge in the spring of 1666.

ematics in 1500 than Greece knew in the time of Archi­

He then young as he was took in hand Des-Cartes's
Geometry (that book which Descartes in his Epistles
with a sort of defiance says is so difficult to understand).
He began with the most crabbed studies & books, like a
high spirited horse who must be first broke in crabbed
grounds & the roughest & steepest ways, or could oth­
erwise be kept within no bounds. When he had read two
or three pages & could understand no farther he being
too reserved and modest to trouble any person to
instruct him begain again & got over three or four more
till he came to another difficult place, & then began
again & advanced farther & continued so doing till he
not only made himself master of the whole without hav­
ing the least light or instruction from any body, but dis­
covered the errors of Descartes ....
He read it in Schooten's Latin translation in the summer
of 1664. Newton's own reminiscences of his mathematical
development tended to minimize the role of Descartes, but
Whiteside's scholarship is conclusive: that "the thick wad of
Newton's research papers surviving from the later months
of 1664 stand firm witness that it was indeed from the hun­
dred or so pages of the Géométrie that his mathematical
spirit took fire .... Above all, I would assert, the Géométrie
gave him his first true vision of the universalizing power
of the algebraic free variable, of its capacity to generalize

the particular and lay bare its inner structure." "Newton
the Mathematician," in Bechler, Contemporary Newtonian
Research, p. 114.
But he also filled it with critical marginalia; e.g., "Error,
Error, non est Geom" and "Imperf:" Trinity College Library,
NQ.16.203.
13. "It seems to be nothing other than that art which they call
by the barbarous name of 'algebra,' if only it could be disen­
tangled from the multiple numbers and inexplicable figures
that overwhelm it . . ." Descartes, Regulee ad directionem
ingenii, Regula IV: 5.
14. This new-found truth had to be stated explicitly. Mahoney
("The Beginnings of Algebraic Thought") quotes Des­
cartes: "Those things that do not require the present atten­
tion of the mind, but which are necessary to the conclusion,
it is better to designate by the briefest symbols than by
whole figures: in this way the memory cannot fail, nor will
thought in the meantime be distracted by these things
which are to be retained."

of the Creator, p. 66.

Westfall, Never at Rest, p. 174.
17. The recognition of infinite series had begun with algebraic
attempts to express pi; Newton's immediate predecessors,
James Gregory and especially John Wallis, were the first to
develop their possibilities. In the simplest sense, infinite
series are implied immediately by decimal notation; in one
of his earliest jotted fragments Newton wrote: "if the frac­
tion 10/3 bee reduced to decimall it will be 3,33333333 &c
infinitely. & what doth every figure signifie but a pte of the
fraction 10/3 which therefore is divisible into infinite pts."

Infinite Series, broached the dangerous and unfamiliar topic
this way: " ... that quantity is infinitely divisible, or that it
may (mentally at least) so far continually diminish, as at last,
before it is totally extinguished, to arrive at quantities which
may be called vanishing quantities, or which are infinitely lit­
tle, and less than any assignable quantity .... " In Cohen and

the undying merit of Newton .... Mathematical entities

'becoming' or in their 'flux.'" Newtonian Studies, p. 8.
4: TWO GREAT ORBS
1. The last authoritative twentieth-century account of the Sci­
entific Revolution, Steven Shapin's Scientific Revolution,
began, "There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolu­
tion, and this is a book about it."
2. Goodstein and Goodstein, Lost Lecture, p. 39.
3. "The appearance of Newton's Principia in 1687 changed all
this .... [It] made continued support for Aristotle's geocen­
tric cosmology untenable. After 1687, medieval cosmology
became irrelevant, because it no longer represented even a
minimally plausible alternative to Newtonian cosmology.
Unlamented, it simply faded away." Grant, Planets, Stars,
and Orbs, p. 10.
4. Yet 1. Bernard Cohen sees the Copernican revolution as "a
fanciful invention of eighteenth-century historians." The
revolution, Cohen asserts, "was not at all Copernican, but
was at best Galilean and Keplerian." Revolution in Science,
p. x. Meanwhile, Cohen and other scholars suggest that
Newton's reading, wide-sweeping though it became, may
have never included Galileo's Discorsi or anything of Kepler.
Nor, at his death, did his considerable library contain any
work by Ptolemy, Copernicus, or Tycho. Cf. Whiteside in
Math, VI: 3 n. and 6 n.
5. Now we say these were the first two of Kepler's three "laws."
We conventionally date these to 1609, when he published
his great work, Astronomia Nova. He put forth a notion of
gravity, too: "Gravity is the mutual tendency of cognate
205

NOTES TO PAGES 49-54
bodies to join each other (of which kind the magnetic force
is)." Nevertheless, by the time of the Principia, at the far end
of the century, few astronomers accepted Kepler's ideas as
firm truths; nor did Newton, in the Principia) see Kepler
as a significant precursor. "It seems clear," 1. B. Cohen
remarked, "that there was no Keplerian revolution in sci­
ence before 1687." Revolution in Science) p. 132; Whiteside,

of lunar mountains, declaring (correctly) that they were as
high as four miles and (incorrectly) that the earth's moun­
tains never reached as high as one mile. For a moment, it
was easier to see the moon than the earth.

16. He copied bits of Wilkins into his Grantham notebook (cf.
Manuel, Portrait) p. 11, and Gjertsen, Newton Handbook) p.
612). Wilkins also expounded systems of "secret writing"­
how to hide one's meaning through obscure or invented or
encoded characters (Mercury; or) the Secret Messenger) 1641).
He became a doctor of divinity and a prominent Parliamen­
tarian, married Oliver Cromwell's sister, and soon after was
made Master of Trinity College, a preferment he held only
briefly before being ousted upon the restoration of Charles
II. He moved to London and became a council member of
the new Royal Society.

18. The river flows from four memoirists in particular: his
niece, Catherine Barton; Marton Folkes, vice-president
of the Royal Society; Barton's husband, John Conduitt;
and Newton's first would-be biographer, William Stukeley.
"The notion of gravitation came into his mind," Stukeley
wrote (Memoirs) p. 20), ". . . occasion'd by the fall of an
apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood."
Voltaire related the story first in An Essay on Epick Poetry
and then in Letters on England (p. 75): "Having retired to the
country near Cambridge in 1666, he was walking in his gar­
den, saw some fruit falling from a tree, and let himself drift
into a profound meditation on this weight, the cause of
which all the scientists have vainly sought for so long and
about which ordinary people never even suspect there is any
mystery."
And Conduitt: "Whilst he was musing in a garden it
came into his thought that the power of gravity (which
brought an apple from the tree to the ground) was not lim­
ited to a certain distance from the earth but that this power
must extend much farther than was usually thought. Why
not as high as the moon said he to himself. ... " Keynes MS
130.4.
The apple story took on an independent life and evolved
over centuries. Perhaps its most wonderful feature is how
207

NOTES TO PAGES 55-58
often, by the twentieth century, the apple was supposed to
have struck Newton on the head. This may not have been
necessary.
Westfall argues, appealingly (Never at Rest) p. 155): "The
story vulgarizes universal gravitation by treating it as a
bright idea." Of course! Yet it was a bright idea. We feel this
deeply. Surely that's why the story has so rooted itself in our
collective consciousness. The bright idea was a crystalliza­
tion of a preexisting unconscious knowledge-shared by
animals and children-that objects fall to the ground. The
bright idea was that this behavior implied a force-to be
named and then studied and measured. "A bright idea can­
not shape a scientific tradition," Westfall adds, and this, too,
seems self-evident. But it did.

and at rest, though not for circular motion. It still defied
people's intuition about moving objects. "That when a thing
lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still for ever,
is a truth that no man doubts of," Hobbes wrote in 1651.
"But that when a thing is in motion, it will eternally be in
motion, unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be
the same (namely, that nothing can change itself), is not so
easily assented to." People get tired and stop moving, so
they imagine inanimate objects do, too. "From hence it is
that the schools say, heavy bodies fall downwards out of an
appetite to rest, and to conserve their nature in that place
which is most proper for them." Leviathan, II.

to be susceptible of definition by other words.

fills evenly.

Scholars have debated Newton's reticence with Barrow. 1.
Bernard Cohen found it inconceivable that Newton could
have withheld his knowledge from Barrow at this crucial
point; he speculated that Barrow just lacked the time or
inclination to start his optical work anew (Pranklin and
Newton) p. 52). But, plausibly, Christianson saw "a prima
facie case of deceit on Newton's part, a hypocritical laughing
up his sleeve at the work of a man who was about to advance
his career" (In the Presence of the Creator) p. 125).

20. He continued: "I shall now take a view of Mr Hooks Con­

24. Newton's silence lasted from June 1673 to November
1675-broken only by one more curt rejection: "I have long
since determined to concern my self no further about the
promotion of Philosophy. And for the same reason I must
desire to be excused from ingaging to exhibit yearly philo­
sophic discourses .... If it were my lot to be in London for
sometime, I might possible take occasion to supply a vacant
week or two with something by me, but that's not worth

9. Newton's physical intuition failed him here, in that he ne­
glected another source of damping for a pendulum in
vacuum-friction within the cord-but years later, soon
before the Principia) he repeated this experiment more care­
fully and began to lose faith in the ether. Cf. Westfall,

15. Hooke and Oldenburg were at war over another matter,
Oldenburg's promotion of Huygens's invention of a spiral­
spring-regulated watch-previously invented, according to
Hooke, by Hooke. Hooke's extant diary scarcely mentions
Newton, ever, but Oldenburg is everpresent: e.g., "the
Lying Dog Oldenburg"; "Oldenburg treacherous and a vil­
lain." Hooke, Diary, November 8, 1675 and January 28,

18. Some commentators have been pleased to note that, in lit­
eral terms, Hooke was no giant; his physique was diminutive
and twisted. His contemporary John Aubrey described him
in Brief Lives as "but of midling stature, something crooked,
pale faced, and his face but little belowe, but his head is
217

NOTES TO PAGES 98-101
lardge." This hardly seems relevant to Newton's choice of
trope. It is clear that the shoulders of giants had already lived
for some centuries as a conventional expression; Robert
Merton has traced its course most magisterially.

raphers. "This is only speculation, of course," Westfall re­
marks, typically. "It is not speculation that Newton had

more general substance, which might be extracted from

11. By the end of his life, a few people knew, including William
Whiston, his successor as Lucasian Professor at Cambridge.
Whiston was stripped of the professorship and tried for
heresy because he made his own Arianism public. He had
received the post because of Newton's patronage; then
Newton refused him membership in the Royal Society
because-Whiston believed--"they durst not choose a
Heretick." Whiston said of his patron, "He was of the most
fearful, cautious, and suspicious temper, that I ever knew."
Memoirs, pp. 250 f.
Westfall notes (Ne'ver at Rest, p. 318) that Isaac Barrow
had gone so far as to write a "Defense of the Blessed Trin­
ity," and his successor as Master of Trinity College vowed to
"batter the atheists and then the Arians .... "
By the time of his death, rumors of Newton's Arianism
had circulated, but his friends and then his biographers
heartily denied them. E.g., Stukeley (Memoirs, p. 71): "Sev­
eral people of heretical and unsettled notions, particularly
those of Arian principles, have taken great pains to inlist Sir
Isaac into their party, but that with as little justice as the
anti-christians."
12. Newton seems to have drafted this dispensation himself. No
one knows how he gained royal approval; perhaps Barrow
interceded for him.

upon is to their own Centers."
14. Newton to Hooke, November 28, 1679, Carres II: 236.
Hooke took this for a lie: "He here pretends he knew not

16. The discussion that followed shows, as Koyré says, "the
level of understanding-or lack of understanding-of even
the best minds of the time." Christopher Wren suggested
shooting a bullet almost straight up, but "round every way,"
to see if the bullets all fall in a perfect circle. Flamsteed said
it was well known that a ball shot directly upward would not
fall back into "the mouth of the piece"; he suggested an
angle of 87 degrees. Koyré, Newtonian Studies) p. 246.
17. Hooke to Newton, December 9,1679. Newton had made a
double error, in fact, because he also noted that such an
object dropped in the Northern Hemisphere would tend
southward as well as eastward. But there are complexities.
Hooke was assuming a vacuum; as Newton later pointed
out, the path through a resisting medium such as air would
in fact be a spiral reaching the earth's center. Also, neither
man was ready (at first) to work out what it meant, gravita­
tionally, to consider the earth's mass as spread through a
sphere extending outside the path of the falling object, rather
than concentrated at a central point. Koyré, Newtonian Stud­
ies) p. 248, and Carres II: 237.
18. He later told Halley, "I refused his correspondence, told
him I had laid Philosophy aside, ... expected to hear no fur­
ther from him, could scarce perswade my self to answer his
second letter; did not answer his third." Newton to Halley,
June 20, 1686, Carres II: 288.

ellipse's center, rather than at a focus. Hooke to Newton,

15. Modern students of physics, with the calculus in their arse­
nal, often find it simple to derive a result of Newton's by cal­
culus yet difficult to understand the same result in the
geometrical terms Newton employed in the Principia. N ew­
ton foresaw this himself. Thirty years later, he gave an
anonymous account, writing of himself in the third person:
By the help of the new Analysis Mr. Newton found out
most of the Propositions in his Principia Philosophiœ;
but because the Ancients for making things certain
admitted nothing into geometry before it was demon­
strated synthetically, that the Systeme of the Heavens
might be founded upon good Geometry. And this
makes it now difficult for such unskillful men to see the
Analysis by which those Propositions were found out.

his use of the calculus in the course of his dispute with Leib-

22. Here and in several other calculations, he was not above
manipulating the numbers to produce the appearance of
exactitude. No one called his bluff. Galileo, in a comparable
position, had elected to stay away from precise numerical
calculations, saying that such vagaries as air resistance do
not "submit to fixed laws and exact description .... It is
necessary to cut loose from such difficulties." Newton, by
contrast, set himself, and science, the obligation to exclude
nothing and calculate everything. As Westfall says, "So
completely has modern physical science modeled itself on
the Principia that we can scarcely realize how unprece­
dented such calculations were." It was impossible, given the
available data, and sometimes he cheated. Westfall, "New­
ton and the Fudge Factor," Science 1 79 (February 23,

this data, but Newton did not pass it by. He did not restrict
himself to idealized tides but tried to consider the geogra­
phy of estuaries and rivers. He studied the map of Batsha
Harbor, with multiple inlets and open channels, reaching
the China Sea and the Indian Ocean, and worked out a the­
ory of wave interference that could account for the data. I.

first, they were called "hypotheses." Principia 794-96. There
were four rules in all; the others were:
Those qualities of bodies that cannot be increased or
diminished and that belong to all bodies on which experi­
ments can be made should be taken as qualities of all bod­
ies universally.
In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from
phenomena by induction should be considered either exactly
or very nearly true notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses,
until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more
exact or liable to exceptions.
31. Quoted in Westfall, Never at Rest, p. 464.
32. "I do not feign hypotheses" is the most popular solution
to one of history's most debated translation problems:
"Hypotheses non jingo." A reasonable alternative is "frame."
Either way, Newton always gets credit for this phrase, but he
did not invent it. Henry Oldenburg (for example) had
described the Royal Society's virtuosi as those "who, neither
feigning nor formulating hypotheses of nature's actions,
seek out the thing itself." Oldenburg to Francisco Trav­

20. The particulars of Newton's breakdown will forever inspire
debate and speculation. As for the fire, most believe Newton
lost some papers to fire in the late seventies; Westfall goes
further and suggests, "There may ... have been a fire­
another fire, as it appears to me-which could well have dis­
tracted him when he was already in a state of acute tension.
Charred papers survive from the 1690s, though it is difficult
to fit them .... " Never at Rest, p. 538. A popular legend
involving a dog called Diamond and a candle (cf. Bartlett's
Familiar Quotations) is surely apocryphal. As for the involun­
tary restraint: no. As for mercury poisoning: he did suffer
symptoms such as insomnia and apparent paranoia, but he
lacked others, and these were temporary; modern tests of his
hair did reveal toxic mercury levels, but the hair cannot be
dated. Some of the debate plays out in Spargo and Pounds,
"Newton's 'Derangement of the Intellect'"; Johnson and
Wolbarsht, "Mercury Poisoning: A Probable Cause ofIsaac
Newton's Physical and Mental Ills"; Ditchburn, "Newton's
Illness of 1692-3"; and Klawans, Newton's Madness.
Whiteside has summarized the scholarly state of affairs:
"Where scholars have, from the pedestals of their own
stand-points, bickered ceaselessly this past century and a
half over the possible causes and long-term after-effects of
Newton's undeniable breakdown ... we would be foolish to
attempt any definitive assessments when the extant record
offers but a blurred glimpse .... " Math VII: xviii.

1. Westfall, Never at Rest, p. 699.
2. The problem was to find the curve (the brachistochrone)
along which a body descending to a given point under its
own gravity will take the shortest time. (Roughly: the shape
of the fastest track for a roller coaster.) Galileo had thought
230

NOTES TO PAGES 156-159
the curve of fastest descent would be a simple arc of a circle,
which is certainly faster than a straight-line ramp. In fact it
is the curve known as the cycloid.
Bernoulli had posed the problem with Newton in mind,
as a challenge, in the context of the simmering calculus pri­
ority dispute. He addressed it to "the very mathematicians
who pride themselves that ... they have not only penetrated
most intimately the hiding-places of a more secret Geome­
try, but have even extended its limits in a remarkable way by
their golden theorems" (quoted by Mandelbrote, Footprints
of the Lion, p. 76). Newton solved it the night it arrived, and
to Whiteside ("Newton the Mathematician," in Bechler,
Contemporary Newtonian Research, p. 122) this feat was evi­
dence of the deterioration of his mathematical powers in old
age: "A couple of years earlier his method of 'maxima &
minima in infinitesimaIs' would have detected that this is
the cycloid in a few minutes, not the twelve hours he in his
rustiness then took."

10. On the matter of Newton and crimson, no one has been
more eloquent than Richard de Villamil in 1931 (Newton the
Man, pp. 14-15), after analyzing his household inventory:
231

NOTES TO PAGES 159-160
... crimson mohairs nearly everywhere. Newton's own
bed was a "crimson mohair bed," with "crimson Harra­
teen' bed-curtains" ... "crimson mohair hangings" ...
a "crimson sattee." In fact, there is no other colour
referred to in the "Inventary" but crimson. This living
in what I may call an "atmosphere of crimson" is prob­
ably one of the reasons why Newton became rather irri­
table toward the end of his life.
11. Newtonians struggled with euphemisms for this relation­
ship even into the twentieth century ("about the exact
nature of [their] friendship there has been unseemly specu­
lation," wrote Andrade in 1947). When Halifax died, in
1715, he left Barton a bequest of more than £20,000-"for
her excellent conversation," Flamsteed wrote maliciously.
There was gossip (though this mangled the sequence of
events) that the connection had facilitated Newton's ap­
pointment to the Mint; Voltaire spread it most famously:
"The infinitesimal calculus and gravitation would have been
of no use without a pretty niece" (Lettres Philosophiques, let­
ter 21).
Then again, Newton's Freudian biographer Frank
Manuel avoided euphemism altogether, choosing to view
Catherine as an incarnation of Hannah: "In the act of forni­
cation between his friend Halifax and his niece was Newton
vicariously having carnal intercourse with his mother?"

in being a woman"). Her name, and not Newton's, appeared

46. As L. J. Russell put it: "You might at any moment hit on a
simple substitution, e.g. in an algebraic equation, or in a
summation of a series, that would lead to a new general
method .... Sometimes even the hint that someone had dis­
covered a method for solving a particular problem was
enough to set you looking in the right direction for solving
it, and you could solve it too. In such a situation, what is
needed is a general clearing house of publicity." "Plagiarism
in the Seventeenth Century, and Leibniz," in Greenstreet,
Isaac Newton, p. 135.
47. Leibniz's symbols did not map neatly onto the notation
Newton had devised for his own use, dotted letters for
fluxions and various alternatives for fluents, and the conse­
quence was that British and Continental mathematics
diverged throughout the eighteenth century. Finally, in the
nineteenth, Leibniz's differential notation prevailed over the
dots even in England.

come, Anglo-French rivalry colored Newton's reception
in France. He had been elected a foreign member of the
Académie Royale in 1699 but had never acknowledged the
honor or communicated with the academy. When French
scientists meant "Newtonians," they generally said, "les
anglais."

Newton (London: Tonson, 1728)) read to the Académie

Conduitt's "Memoir," in Isaac Newton: Eighteenth-Century
Perspectives, pp. 26-34. ("He had such a meekness and
sweetness of temper .... His whole life was one continued
series of labour, patience, charity, generosity, temperance,
piety, goodness, and all other virtues, without a mixture
of any vice whatsoever.") In the contemporary manner,
Fontenelle also embellished Newton's ancestry: "descended
from the elder branch of the family of Sir John Newton
Baronet .... Manor of Woolstrope had been in his Family
near 200 years Sir Isaac's Mother ... was likewise of an
ancient family " In fairness to Fontenelle, he relied on a
pedigree Newton had embellished himself, after being
knighted.
The supposedly singular laugh is originally due to Hum­
phrey Newton; Stukeley (Memoirs) p. 57) considered this at
length and said that he had often seen Newton laugh and
that "he was easily made to smile, if not to laugh."

properties to space-time." The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence>

Introduction, p. lv, Or, as Howard Stein puts it: "In spite of
the fact that absolute space and absolute time have been
abandoned, and the geometric structure of space-time has
proved to be interdependent with the distribution of matter ...
it remains necessary to regard space-time and its geometry
as having a status as 'real' as that of matter .... On this gen­
eral score-although certainly not in detail-Newton was, in
the eyes of our own science, 'right' to take space and time as
fundamental entities." "Newton's Metaphysics," in Cohen

different Densities and Forces, and thereby to vary the Laws

Acknowledgments and Sources
I have meant to ground this book as wholly as possible in its time;
in the texts. The diaspora of Newton's manuscripts began at his
death, continued for more than three centuries, and has only lately
been reversed. They are still widely scattered, but the Cambridge
University Libraries have gathered much of the essential core
holding, including much of Newton's own library, annotated by
him. I am indebted to Adam J. Perkins and others for great cour­
tesy. Documents are cited according to the Cambridge number­
ing scheme as Add MS (Additional Manuscripts) or Keynes
MS (Keynes Collection at Kings College). I am grateful to Joanna
Corden, Rafael Weiser, Silvie Merian, and their colleagues in the
archives of the Royal Society of London, the Jewish National and
University Library in Jerusalem (Yehuda MS), and the Pierpont
Morgan Library in New York, and to the National Trust custodi­
ans at Woolsthorpe Manor, for access and knowledge.

OTHER PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES
The authoritative scientific biography is Richard S. Westfall's
Never at Rest (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980).
He offered a salutary warning to all who follow: "The more I
have studied him, the more N ewton has receded from me. . . .
Only another Newton could hope fully to enter into his being,
and the economy of the human enterprise is such that a second
Newton would not devote himself to the biography of the
first."
