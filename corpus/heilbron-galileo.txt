PREFACE
It will be useful and perhaps reassuring to state that this is not the biogra­
phy of a mathematician. To be sure, Galileo enjoyed such epithets as "divine
mathematician" and "Tuscan Archimedes," and he spent the first half of his
career, from 1589 to 1610, as a professor of mathematics. Moreover, histo­
rians rank him as the first to introduce effective quantification into phys­
ics. For all that, he was no more (or less!) a mathematician than he was a
musician, artist, writer, philosopher, or gadgeteer. His last disciple and first
biographer, Vincenzo Viviani, boasted that his master could compete with
the best lutanists in Tuscany, advise painters and poets on matters of artis­
tic taste, and recite vast stretches of Petrarch, Dante, and Ariosto by heart.
But his great strength, Galileo said when negotiating for a post at the Medici
court in 1610, was philosophy, on which he had spent more years of study
than he had months on mathematics.'
Calileo's intense study of the moon, sun, and planets in 1609/10, when
he was the only man on earth anatomizing the man in the moon and the
satellites of Jupiter, called upon his skills as an observer and draughtsman,
his dexterity as a craftsman, and his knowledge of perspective and foreshad­
owing, and not at all on his ability as a mathematician. The hurried little
masterpiece, Sidereus nuncius (1610), which described his unprecedented
observations and astonishing deductions, quickly compelled assent. Years
of reading the poets and experimenting with literary forms enabled him to
write clearly and plausibly about the most implausible things. If ever a dis­
coverer was perfectly prepared to make and exploit his discovery, it was the
dexterous humanist Galileo aiming his first telescope at the sky.
Perhaps the best single-word descriptor for Galileo is "critic." He was a true
connoisseur of the arts and sciences, able, says Viviani, to talk intelligently,
and with apt quotations, on virtually every respectable subject with all sorts of
people. As a connoisseur, he argued the excellence of painting over sculpture,
monody over counterpoint, one version of Dante's Hell over another, and,
in mathematics, Archimedes over everybody. Galileo was the embodiment
v

vi
PREFACE
of baroque buon gusto in matters of art and science. That, of course, did not
mean that he was judicious or well mannered. He often deviated from good
taste in criticizing others. This indulgence, coupled with an inventive wit and
the adolescent pleasure, which he never outgrew, of scoring off people, made
him powerful enemies even among those who respected his gifts.
Galileo would have done well in any of several professions. He might have
chosen as his brother Michelangelo did, and followed their father's path as a
musician; or do as he said he would have preferred had he had a free choice,
and become a painter.' He could have been a man ofletters, the confidential
secretary to a duke or cardinal, or better, a grand duke or pope. About the
only profession for which he was unsuited was the one for which his father
intended him: medicine. Galileo pitched on mathematics, for which he had
a knack, as an escape from doctoring. The remedy worked. He had the good
fortune to invent a clever proposition that enabled him, at the age of 20,
to demonstrate several theorems in the style of Archimedes that impressed
a few mathematicians in Italy. These theorems represented the high point
of Calilco's mathematics. He did not publish them in their time, but fifty
years later, as an appendix to his last and most technical book, Discourses on
two new sciences (1637). He never made much use of algebra, disliked compli­
cated calculations of the sort that delighted Kepler, and avoided geometrical
questions more difficult than those with which he debuted.
As a young man, carefree despite the family's straitened finances,
esteemed by friends from among the best families in Florence, clever, witty,
sociable, versed in literature and music, and with a gift for geometry and
a taste for gambling, Galileo did not resemble much the troubled inventor
of modern science familiar from the usual histories. His friends would not
have expected him to become the sworn enemy of Aristotle, the champion
of Copernicus, the standard-bearer of mathematics, the bête noire of the Jes­
uits, or the best-known of all martyrs to academic freedom. Galileo would
have become none of these things had he not had to work for a living.
This book appears on the 400th anniversary of Galileo's announcement of
the riches his telescope revealed in the heavens. This was an event of world­
historical importance. Another, coincident anniversary, the centennial of
the completion of the national edition of Galileo's correspondence, manu­
scripts, and printed works, marks an accomplishment of equal importance
in the smaller world of Galileo scholars. For a hundred years this inspired
edition by Antonio Favaro and the specialized studies he spun from it have

guided the investigations of biographers of Galileo and historians of the Sci­
entific Revolution. The number of directly relevant useful publications now
extends to many thousands. The last decade alone has been enlivened by
the appearance of many serious book-length biographies and monographs.
Why, apart from centennial obeisance, burden the world with another? Is
there anything fresh to say?
Yes. Galileo's biographers tend to rush their gladiator prematurely into an
imaginary arena filled with pig-headed philosophers and fire-spitting priests.
He did spend time arguing with and suffering from such people. But Galileo the
gladiator and martyr of science began as Galileo the patrician humanist. I hope
to have introduced something fresh by locating Galileo more firmly among
Florentine cultural institutions than others have done. That makes space for
character development. Galileo underwent a sort of epiphany under the impe­
tus of the telescopic discoveries he made at the age of 45. He had published very
little, and nothing of importance, up to that time. He had many good ideas, but
held them back, partly from a feeling of financial insecurity and partly from a
cultivated circumspection. He saw no reason to burden the world with scat­
tered results, half-treatises, imperfect theories, or unproved assertions.
When he had armed himself with the telescope, however, he declared all
he knew and more. To the surprise of his colleagues and against their advice,
he attacked philosophers, theologians, and mathematicians, taunted the Jes­
uits, jousted with everyone who contested his priority or his opinions. He
became a knight errant, quixotic and fearless, like one of the paladins in his
favorite poem, Ariosto's Orlando furioso. This change in behavior, which won
him a continually lengthening list of enemies, made his disastrous collision
with a pope who for many years had been his friend and admirer intelligible
and even inevitable. Restoring to Galileo his youth in Pisa and Florence, his
maturation in Padua, and his megalomaniacal middle age in the Medici court
not only gives his history what he might have called momento but also helps
to fix his role as hero of the Scientific Revolution. He was a great man in the
sense that he changed the world in a way others could not, not by inventing
telescopic astronomy or finding a few principles of motion, but by bringing
in his special idiom some fundamental problems in the culture of his time so
crisply into conflict that they could not be avoided or resolved.
Galileo lived for 78 years, many of them in the eye of a storm. He had
friends, enemies, and correspondents of all sorts: mathematicians, philoso­
phers, literary people, bureaucrats, princes, cardinals, and characters from

PREFACE
the heroic poems he knew almost by heart. The minor actors easily slip from
the memory. A genealogical table of the Galilei and a glossary of most people
mentioned in the text apart from such household names as Einstein and God,
but including characters from Ariosto and Tasso, follow Chapter VIII.
Galileo's mathematics seldom goes beyond plane geometry and the rules
of proportion, and most of his published writings on physics and astronomy
remained at the level of popularized science in his own day. Neither his geometry
nor his science should present a technical challenge to today's educated lay person.
On the contrary: the main obstacle to overcome in understanding Calileo's work
is thinking that he was engaged in the same enterprise as modern physicists.
As will appear, many of his apparent errors are mathematical jokes, rhetorical
exaggerations, or wishful thinking. Failure to appreciate that his genre was not
ours has prompted many unnecessary arguments and misunderstandings,
which it will be a pleasure not to review here. What criticism is offered of his
work stays within Galileo's own terms of reference.
It is a great pleasure to thank colleagues for their help and support, not
only in customary acknowledgment of debt, but also in gratitude that,
despite fashionable widespread cynicism about the academy, generosity and
encouragement abound in some corners of the Republic of Letters. Among
these generous Republicans are Paolo Galluzzi, Massimo Bucciantini, Eman
McMullin, Nick Jardine, Maurice Finocchiaro, Jim Bennett, Sven Dupré,
Peter Watson, Louise Clubb, Mario Biagioli, Mike Shank, José Ferreirôs, and
Jed Buchwald. Sunspots provided occasion for supererogatory expressions
of solidarity: Franz Oaxecker very kindly supplied his books and expertise
about Christoph Scheiner, and Eileen Reeves and Albert Van Helden with
equal kindness sent the proofs of their new and definitive translations of the
main documents in the squabble between Scheiner and Galileo. My thanks
also go to keepers of the treasure houses of the Republic, especially the staffs
of the Upper Reading Room of the Bodleian Library, the Taylorian Library,
and the Museum of the History of Science, all in Oxford, and of the Museo
Galileo (Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza) in Florence.
Publishing books is as essential to the Republic of Letters as writing them.
Latha Menon, who commissioned this book, and her colleagues at Oxford
University Press UK, Emma Marchant and Claire Thompson, are exemplary

I
A Florentine Education
1.1 UPBRINGING
On the façade of a house near the central train station in Florence there is
an immense inscription in stone setting forth Galileo's feats. Commissioned
by his hagiographer Viviani, it includes among the encomia the informa­
tion that Galileo was born on the day, almost to the hour, of the death of
Michelangelo, "the divinely endowed spirit" whom God had appointed to
instruct the Florentines in art, poetry, and architecture. "God himself com­
pensated you," so Viviani's stony billboard addresses Michelangelo's pos­
terity, "and enhanced your glorious annals with the birth of your patrician
Galileo, most blissful initiator, father, prince, and guide of philosophy, geom­
etry, and astronomy."
The story lacks a week of the truth. Michelangelo died on 9 February
1564. Galileo's mother, Giulia Ammannati, uncooperative as usual, delayed
his birth to 16 February. We know the day and time of the event from two
birth charts that Galileo later drew up for himself. 2 Although Galileo did not
receive Michelangelo's soul fresh from its owner, he inherited a genius of
michelangelic proportions and the taste of Michelangelo's generation. Gali­
leo was a humanist of the old school. He much preferred Ariosto, the dar­
ling poet of the sixteenth century, to Tasso, who would be a favorite of the
seventeenth. He rated writers like Machiavelli higher than the prosateurs of
his own time.' He did not like mannerism in art, distortions, extravagances,
anamorphoses. He was a stickler for decorum. He stayed with the geometry
of the Greeks rather than employ the algebras of his contemporaries. He had
little interest in the advanced planetary astronomy of Tycho and Kepler. He
1

always began with Aristotle. He was not an innovator by temperament. And,
we are told, he liked to wear clothes that were fifty years out of date."
Although Galileo was born in Pisa, the hometown of his recalcitrant
mother, he prided himself on being a noble of Florence through his father,
Vincenzo Galilei, a musician and musical theorist. Vincenzo's nobility did not
imply wealth but the right to hold civic office and he lived in the straitened
circumstances usual in his profession. His marriage to Giulia, whose family
dealt in cloth, was a union of art and trade. When they married in 1562, he
received two bolts of cloth from his bride's brother, and, what went further,
a hundred ducats and a year's rent on a house.' For a time the new husband
worked in Pisa at the textile trade but soon moved to Florence where he set
up as a musician and came to the attention of Giovanni de' Bardi, a man of
the world who had fought the Turks and returned to Florence to patronize
the arts. Bardi became a true friend and reliable patron. He sent Vincenzo to
Venice to study with the top musical theorist of the time, Gioseffè Zarlino.
That was in the 1560s. Vincenzo also spent time in Rome collecting madri­
gals. He returned to Pisa or Florence and Giulia often enough to father six
or seven children, three of whom played parts in Galileo's life-his younger
sisters Virginia and Livia, and his younger brother Michelangelo. During the
early 1570S, Vincenzo lived in Florence, building up his reputation as a theo­
rist in Bardi's circle, which called itself the Camerata after the small room in
which it met, and devising an attack on the polyphony and tuning he had
learned from Zarlino."
Vincenzo was addicted to his music. He played the lute whenever and
wherever possible, "walking in town, riding a horse, standing at the window,
lying in bed." We know this odd fact from his most important book, Fronimo
(1568, 1584), which contains many compositions for two lutes, one accom­
panying the other.' Galileo grew up playing second lute to his compulsive
father. He could have learned freethinking also from Vincenzo, who liked to
say, as Galileo did too, that people who invoke authority to win arguments
are fools." Calileo's mother Giulia knew the value of authority. It was said
that she brought Galileo before the Holy Office (the Inquisition) in Florence
for calling her names-puttana, gabrina (harlot, crone)-and that the obliging
inquisitor issued an admonition to the exasperated son. The choice of com­
pliment, "gabrina," adds verisimilitude to the story; the nasty ugly old witch
Gabrina is a character in Ariosto's Orlando furioso, which Vincenzo admired
as much as Galileo. Like Gabrina, Giulia did not improve with age. A year

before she died in 1620, Galileo's brother Michelangelo, then a court musi­
cian in Bavaria, expressed his surprise at learning that their mother was "still
so terrible." Her more impressive performances included coming to blows
with Galileo's mistress, suborning his servant to spy on him, and trying to
steal spectacle lenses he kept in his shop." Perhaps Galileo worried about
congenital madness. It is suggestive that the main question he put to the
horoscopes he cast for his daughters was how rational they would be."
While Vincenzo traveled or sojourned in Florence, Galileo lived in Pisa,
sometimes with Giulia, at the house of a relative, Muzio Tedaldi. In these
circumstances he began Latin and other necessary subjects under a teacher
of whom it is known only that his name was Jacopo Borghini and that he
charged s lire a month." At the age of 11 the boy began a more regular course
of study at the mother monastery of the Vallombrosan order (a variety of
Benedictines) near Florence. Vallombrosa was a beautiful place certain to
appeal to a romantic teenager awakening to art, literature, and spiritual
life. During his stay the monks entertained the artist Federico Zuccari, then
working on sketches of the seven deadly sins for his frescoes in the cupola of
the Florentine cathedral, and a little later Giovanni Stradano came to paint
the portraits of the monastery and its enchanted forest (Plate l)Y Vallom­
brosa's monks were distinguished for their learning, notably the abbot, "a
man of rare and acute mind," at home, we are assured, in theology, astrol­
ogy, mathematics, rhetoric, cosmology, and "all the other sound arts and sci­
ences." Galileo's lifetime flirtation with the art of astrology may well have
begun at Vallombrosa. A younger boy, his ill-fated friend Orazio Morandi,
was to join the Vallombrosans and rise to abbot of its seat in Rome, which he
turned into an astrological research institute. Its archives held a birth chart
for Calileo.!'
The attractions of Vallombrosa, its setting, arts, learned monks, and
stable life, persuaded Galileo that he had a religious calling. Very likely also
the mixed impulses of early adolescence gave him twinges of conscience
and piety that he thought to assuage by joining his teachers. He may have
worn a monk's garb for a while. He did not complete his novitiate, how­
ever, or perhaps enter fully into it because his father abruptly removed him
from the temptation. Although Vincenzo had praised the monkish life of
withdrawal-"truly blessed is he who has fled the irritations and tiresome
vanities of the world, the intemperance, ambition, pride, adulation, anger,
deceptions, and so on of the court, and goes to live a solitary and peaceful

4
GALILEO
life"-he had no wish to see his heir buried in a monastery." Galileo's first
steps back into our vale of tears took him to Pisa. "I am glad that you have
Galileo back and that you want to send him here to study," Tedaldi wrote in
July 1578, though, with grain at rs lire a sack, a growing boy would cost some­
thing to maintain." That the price of bread for Galileo should have been a
consideration suggests that playing the lute in all possible places had not
made Vincenzo wealthy.
After the escape from Vallombrosa, Vincenzo tried to place Galileo in
Pisa's Collegio di Sapienza, set up by Cosimo I de' Medici in 1543 for smart
kids from impoverished families. Galileo qualified for admission in every
particular except that, at 14, he was four years under age. He remained at
home until, in September 1580, at 16, he could enroll at the University of Pis a,
an old foundation given new life by Cosimo I, to begin the study of medi­
cine." The course required some knowledge of Aristotelian physics. Pisa had
two able expositors of the subject, Francesco Buonamici and Girolamo Borro
(or Borri). Each taught a rigid Aristotelianism without agreeing on its prin­
ciples, although both had a deep respect for the integrity of the philosophy
they interpreted and a deep disdain for the compromises required to subject
Greek philosophy to Christian theology," Accordingly, they had no patience
with the system of Thomas Aquinas, then recently recognized by the Coun­
cil of Trent as official Catholic teaching and enthusiastically so received by
the Dominicans and the Jesuits. Without the prophylaxis ofThomism, Aris­
totle's philosophy contained teachings toxic to Christians. Among the most
frightful of these were the eternity of the universe, the mortality of the soul,
and a deity incapable of knowing individuals: no creation, no last or interme­
diate judgment, no afterlife, no Providence, no Christianity. It took courage
to be a strict Aristotelian in a Catholic university in Galileo's time.
The bravos Borro arid Buonamici set the agenda for Galileo's physics.
Their diverting lectures on motion and gravity did not lie on his immedi­
ate path, however, since physicians did not need to know why bodies fall
in order to put their patients underground. Nor did the medical course lie
on his direct path, except as an obstacle. An honorable way to finish with it
unexpectedly opened through the Medici court, which customarily moved
to Pisa for a period around Easter. Among its hangers-on was a mathemati­
cian, Ostilio Ricci, who would end his career as mathematician to the Grand
Duke Ferdinando I. In 1583, however, when he met the disaffected medical
student, Ricci was merely the instructor of the grand-ducal pages. Galileo

heard a lecture or two of Ricci's on Euclid. With that instruction he mas­
tered Euclid's Elements almost on his own and showed such promise that his
teacher advocated his release from medicine. Vincenzo agreed most reluc­
tantly. He too liked mathematics, or anyway arithmetic, which he employed
in his musical theorizing, but he knew that mathematicians were no more
prosperous than lutanists."
Galileo continued at Pisa until 1585, when, like many a noble youth, he left
university without a degree. Meanwhile he had continued with his reading.
Ricci introduced him to the work of Archimedes, who would be to Galileo
what Virgil was to Dante: an ancient shade sure of the path, the one through
Hell, the other through mathematics. To Galileo Archimedes would always
be "superhuman," the exemplar of the mathematician pure and applied: the
theorist of cones and balances, of quadratures and barycenters, but also
the inventor of machines to catch counterfeiters, destroy navies, and do the
work of giants.

Mathematics
During the 1580s Ricci began to teach at yet another institution established
under the civic-minded despot Cosimo I: the Accademia del Disegno set up
in 1569 for the instruction of artists, sculptors, and architects. The first direc­
tors provided for instruction in mathematics and money to pay for one lec­
ture a week, on Sundays, open to anyone who preferred science to sermons.
The stipend, one ducat a month, was a fourth or a fifth of the salary of a
beginning university professor of mathematics, not enough to keep the post
filled until the engagement of Ricci in 1589. His lecturing covered Euclidean
geometry and its application to architecture and perspective, which he also
taught privately. One of his venues was the home of Bernardo Buontalenti,
a friend and collaborator of Vincenzo Galilei's patron Bardi and a favorite
architect of the Medici. Among those who heard Ricci lecture at Buontal­
enti's was Lodovico Cardi, who, under thé nickname of Cigoli, occupied
the van of Florentine painters of his time. Galileo may have been present at
Buontalenti's and possibly attended the Disegno, where Cigoli taught." In
any case, the two became fast friends and Galileo learned how to draw,"

GALILEO
With Ricci's encouragement and Vincenzo's agreement, Galileo spent his
first post -nongraduate years preparing himself desultorily for the insignificant
post of a mathematics professor. According to the traditional ranking of the
sciences, philosophers and physicians occupied the top of the academic ladder,
mathematicians and grammarians the bottom. Galileo was not the sort to sit
contentedly on lower rungs. Nor did he expect to. Some well-placed math­
ematicians were arguing, occasionally successfully, that their work deserved
greater respect than philosophers accorded it. Three of these mathematicians
were important for Galileo's career. The eldest and most aggressive, Giovanni
Battista Benedetti (1530-90), served as court mathematician to the Duke of
Savoy; his most important work for Galileo was a book of Physical and mathe­
matical speculations that replaced several important Aristotelian positions about
motion with propositions identical to ones Galileo would adopt." The second
in age and first in institutional power was Christoph Clavius (1537-1612), pro­
fessor of mathematics at the central Jesuit university, the Collegio Romano,
from 1565 until his death (Plate 6). He fought energetically and effectively for
a conspicuous place for mathematics in the Jesuit curriculum and established
a quasi-research group at the college, but he did not try to subvert standard
physics with its results." He would support Galileo's career and the mathema­
ticians at the Roman College would help advance it-up to a point.
The third of Calileo's early mathematical mentors, the Marchese Guido­
baldo del Monte (1545-1607), was the most conventional and the most useful.
A man of the world as well as of books, del Monte had fought against the Turks
(we shall meet several more such veterans) and served briefly as inspector of
the fortresses of Tuscany before retiring to his castle near Urbino to work at
mathematics. Galileo adopted del Monte's approach to simple machines, the
Liber mechanicorum (1577), then considered the best modern book on the sub­
ject, and del Monte adopted Galileo as his scientific son." He and his brother,
Francesco Maria del Monte, no mathematician but, as a cardinal, a powerful
patron, helped to impose Galileo on the University of Pisa as its lecturer in
mathematics in 1589. Benedetti, Clavius, and del Monte were role models.
Galileo began, as Clavius ended, a professor; ended, as Benedetti began, a
court mathematician; and, though far from a hereditary marquis, had the
same sense of the dignity of his profession as del Monte.
Mathematics had crouched low among Aristotelian sciences for two
reasons. First, it dealt with abstractions like lines without thickness and
planes without body, and so operated in a world of make-believe. When

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION

its conclusions did pertain to physical things, they tended to be the least
interesting things knowable. Who cares how tall Socrates was? Quantitative
accidents-dates, scores, balance sheets-annoy and bore most people. Still,
although the height of Socrates does not signify, that of the pole star does;
and since knowledge of it allows us to navigate, it must relate to some sort
of truth. Another unexceptionable example of the sometime truth of math­
ematics frequently invoked at the time argued from the spherical shape of
the earth to the conclusion that the sun cannot shine on its entire surface at
once." It was no less a truth if argued the other way around, from the limited
illumination to the spherical shape. This brings us to the second reason for
depreciating mathematics: the nature of its proofs.
In Aristotelian logic, the strongest demonstration (demonstratio potissima) is
the perfect syllogism, of which the form "all B are A, all Bare C, therefore all
A are C" is the exemplar. In practice, the premises of a physical proposition
(all B are A, all B are C) were agreements among philosophers based on the
repeated and confirmed experiences of rational animals." The question natu­
rally arose whether mathematics made use of the demonstratio potissima. Per­
haps yes, because Aristotle recommended geometrical proofs; but perhaps
no, because we lack direct experience of the abstract entities of the geometers.
Furthermore, the major premise of geometrical propositions is often far from
any axiom or first principle and may not involve directly or at all the defining
property or "essence" of geometrical figures. Euclid argued from an axiom
about parallel lines that the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles.
How could that axiom be a proper definition or representation of the essence
of triangles, which cannot be constructed from parallel lines?"
Most people interested in such questions in the sixteenth century denied
that mathematics met the standard of the demonstratio potissima because it could
not establish its premises by the intuitive certainty of sense experience." Or,
if its premises be allowed, its demonstrations might be very powerful but the
knowledge so gained relatively little, as inapplicable to the sensory world;
or, if applicable, in "mixed sciences" like astronomy, no longer certain, since
astronomy, like all physical sciences, had to take its principles from observa­
tion and experience. Assertive mathematicians replied that their methods dif­
fered from, but were no less powerful than, the best syllogistic demonstration.
Clavius took this position, as did his student Giuseppe Biancani, who would
become an authority among the [esuits." Others argued that mathematics
had the same logical structure as physics and stronger demonstrations when

8
GALILEO
applied to mixed sciences like astronomy." Consideration of these life-and­
death questions added excitement to the existence of a mathematician. If
granted equality in certainty and relevance with physics, mathematics might
be the Archimedean lever with which, if he could find a place to put it, a math­
ematician might move the world. Galileo would expend great effort and incur
much ill will in seeking the place and working the lever.
Galileo did not have the means of a marquis or the reputation to qualify
as a court mathematician. That left teaching. He recruited private pupils, per­
haps among his friends in Florence, certainly among seekers of science in
and around Siena. In 1588 he found a job for three months with his friends
the Vallombrosans tutoring a brother in perspective at their monastery in
Passignano; he received a total of 58 lire (around 8 scudi), which, if continued
for a year, would have brought him half the salary of a poorly paid profès­
sor." The same year, 1588, he tried for the junior chair of mathematics at the
University of Bologna. His application opens with an arithmetical error: it
gives his age as "around 26," though he was only 23. Apparently he thought
his youth incongruous with his mathematical pedigree, which consisted of
his time with Ricci and his experience of teaching in Florence and Siena.
It continued with his attainments. "He has the most excellent judgment
[in mathematics] and in many other things he has studied, notably in the
humanities and in philosophy." The electors preferred Giovanni Antonio
Magini, Calileo's senior by nine years, a practiced astrologer and astrono­
mer, diligent calculator, and, later, Galileo's occasional friend. No doubt they
took the safer choice. Magini was a graduate of their university. Also, Bolo­
gna's senior professor of mathematics, Pietro Antonio Cataldi, doubted the
correctness of a premise that underpinned the mathematical proofs Galileo
submitted as his strongest credential. The professor of mathematics at the
University of Padua, Giuseppe Moletti, agreed with Cataldi that Galileo was
a good geometer with a defective premise. Del Monte and Clavius also had
trouble with it. As will appear, it was unexceptionable, although (and this
may have been the trouble) it did not deliver what Galileo's proofs needed."
Music
Magini's victory extended Galileo's opportunities to cultivate literature and
music in Florence. Among the many cultural gurus who helped develop his
taste and character during the four years he lived at home between leaving

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
9
Pisa without a degree and returning as a professor, the most influential was
his father. Vincenzo Galilei was then engaged in defending the modernizing
program he set out in 1581 in his Dialogo della musica antica e della moderna (1581).
Musical theory needed overhauling, according to Galilei, because the current
orthodoxy, as represented by Zarlino, did not correspond to practice. Zarlino
accepted Ptolemy-the same deserving Ptolemy whose cosmology Galileo
would savage-and cleaved to him although the simplest experiment would
convince an educated ear that modern music did not use the Ptolemaic dia­
tonic scale. Galilei's spokesman in his Dialogue on ancient and modern music is
his patron Bardi, who explains the matter to an astute and inquisitive mutual
friend, the practical musician Piero Strozzi. They agree as a condition of the
discussion that "we always set aside (as Aristotle says in the eighth book of
the Physics) not only authority but seemingly plausible reasoning that may
be contrary to any perception of truth." Vincenzo Galilei was a theorist of
integrity. He did not just reject authority but showed by "sensory experience
and necessary demonstration," as Galileo would say, just where the author­
ity went astray. Ptolemy had succumbed to a numerology that appeared to
secure a tuning based on the characterization of musical intervals by the dif­
ferent lengths of otherwise identical vibrating strings. A string half the length
of another under the same tension sounded the octave; with lengths in the
ratio 2:3, the fifth; 3:4, the fourth; 4:5 and 5:6, the major and minor third. In
recommending Ptolemy's scheme, Zarlino liked to dwell on the perfection of
the number six, from which all the ratios descend, as well as their simplicity,
all being of the form n/(n + 1).32
Galilei dismissed the numerology as nonsense and Zarlino's claim that
singers naturally adopted Ptolemy's. diatonic tuning in polyphonic music
as false. As Galilei discovered under the guidance of a Florentine living in
Rome, Girolamo Mei, who had made a thorough study of ancient Greek
music, Ptolemy's authority was an artifact. Moderns had decided to prefer
him to his ancient competitors just as, with equal arbitrariness, they had
chosen Aristotle over plato in philosophy. Mei very generously shared his
knowledge of the alternatives; all he required to unlock his generosity was
assurance that Galilei too was a Florentine patrician." That being given,
Galilei learned that the Greeks had used many modes and monodies, and
knew nothing of the four-part harmony that Zarlino taught and ranked
as the most perfect of musical forms. A romantic as well as a scholar, Mei
understood that the main purpose of music was not rational entertainment

la
GALILEO
but appeal to the emotions, and that Zarlino's play with the number six was
mumbo jumbo. Galilei's Dialogue employs Mei's principles, and sometimes
his very words, which came to this: Greek music had more emotional power
than modern counterpoint because it was monodic and polymodal." Music
that accompanied singing had to be matched to words even at the cost of
violating rules of progression or harmony."
Adopting Galilei's battle cry, "counterpoint ... is an enemy of music,"
Bardi incorporated some of his protégé's ideas in the musical interludes
he arranged for three successive Medici weddings in the 1580s. These inter­
mezzi, which framed stage plays, were showpieces incorporating compli­
cated stage machinery, singers, and musicians. Galilei contributed at least
one piece to these extravaganzas, a lament based on the speech the miser­
able Ugolino muttered at the very pit of Dante's Inferno. The obvious inver­
sion of the performance, in which the play framed and incorporated the
intermezzi, developed rapidly in Florence in the 1590S and eventuated in
1600 in Jacopo Peri's Erudice, the first opera whose score has survived. Cigoli
provided the scenery. The occasion was still another Medici wedding. The
movement to which Galilei and the Camerata belonged was not an inconse­
quential mobilization of argumentative musical theorists, but an important
component of an artistic and aristocratic culture. Galileo had deep roots in
this culture and tendrils to Peri and the Camerata."
Zarlino complained of his former student's betrayal and said so in print,
in 1588. In reply, Galilei described additional experiments to show the misfit
between the Italian ear and the Pythagorean and Ptolemaic tunings; issued
the so-called "laws of Galilei" (two successive consonances of the same size
do not produce a consonance, and the difference between an octave and a
consonance is a consonance); and aimed a very neat blow against the stand­
ard numerology. Why take the lengths of vibrating strings as the definition
of pitch? If the tensions in chords of equal length are preferred, the fifth cor­
responds to the ratio 9:4, the octave to 4:1, and so on." Vincenzo probably
had Galileo's help in the refinement of the experiments that underlay these
ratios. The experiments included tests of similar strings stretched by une­
qual weights and strings of unequal cross-sections bearing similar weights.
Father and son studied deviations from unison caused by the nature, struc­
ture, and form of the strings, and the manner of plucking. A particularly
interesting investigation showed that a steel string and one of gut tuned to
unison in the octave would not agree perfectly when stopped at a fret. The

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
11
best that can be done when instruments play together or accompany singers
is to forget the perfect ratios of the various modes and tune everything to
equal temperament."
Two propositions in Vincenzo's final investigations sound very much
like Galileo. Referring to a "simple-minded assertion of Zarlino," father
or son points out that to get a tone and its octave simultaneously from a
single string, it must be stopped at a third, not a half, of its length. The other
proposition in Calileo's style states that a sliding transition from one note to
another on a fretless string instrument does not take place continuously, but
through a series of discrete steps so small, "almost like atoms," that the ear
cannot distinguish them. But mathematics can. "There are few things that
cannot be weighed, numbered, and measured."? One of these few things is
poetry.
Poetry
Galileo's social life during his gap years did not center on mathematicians,
of which there were few in town besides the grand duke's lecturer Ricci, his
astrologer Raffaelo Gualterotti, and his globe maker Antonio Santucci."
Galileo preferred literary men, Florentine nobles like him though wealthier,
of which there were many. Two of them played important parts in Galileo's
story. One, Giovanni Battista Ricasoli Baroni, a studious and disturbed young
man, died early under circumstances soon to be related. The other, Giovanni
Battista Strozzi (il giovane), 17 years Galileo's senior, had distinguished him­
self early among the cultivated aristocratic young men of Florence. He took
even longer than Galileo not to graduate from the University of Pisa, some
seven years spent with Borro, Buonamici, and literary dilettantes. If Galileo
had had any money, he would have faced the same career choice as Strozzi
did: marriage, church, or court. None appealed to Strozzi. His inamorata
wed another; for the church he had no calling; and he was far too rich to
serve the Medici. In 1590 he went to live with the Oratorians in Rome and
soon became intimate with the grandees and prelates there. He would be
helpful when Galileo undertook to instruct the papal court on astronomy.
Strozzi and Ricasoli were leading lights of a serious literary club, the
Accademia degli Alterati, composed, etymologically, of altered, twisted,
false, angry, and befuddled poets. There is good reason to believe that
Galileo was a member. Several other friends belonged, including Bardi,

12
GALILEO
and, although the Academy's incomplete records do not mention Galileo,
he was present to hear Ricasoli deliver a lament over the death of Grand
Duke Francesco IY During his gap years, Galileo cultivated exactly the
same subjects that then occupied the Alterati. His pertinent extant com­
positions include two handfuls of poems, extensive "Notes" on Petrarca's
Rime and Ariosto's Furioso, "Considerations" on the Gerusalemme liberata of
Torquato Tasso, outlines for a play, and, though neither poetry nor criti­
cism, two lectures on Dante's Inferno, almost none of them published in
their time." Except for the lectures and a satirical poem, they cannot be
dated precisely. Rather than agonize inconclusively over their chronology,
we will consider his "literary" writings when they best fit his story." On
this principle, the criticism of Ariosto and Tasso began during the late
Is80s when a controversy over their relative merits engaged all the literary
types in Florence." The controversy had its lighter side as academicians
struggled to decide whether Homer or Virgil, Ariosto or Tasso was the
greater poet, whether Tuscan was the best of all languages, and whether
Aristotle's principles of poetry should regulate Italian romances. Galileo's
notes and considerations supplied weapons for himself and his friends
for deployment in the Italian theatre of the warfare between ancients and
moderns."
The Alterati changed its director or regent every six months. During each
term, members placed compositions in a large vase excavated now and then
by a "censor" and a "defender." These officials argued the merits and faults of
the various pieces before the academy, which chose a few that it wanted to
hear at length." A fragment by Galileo about good taste represented the tone
and type desired. It explains how a judicious critic differs from a pedant.
Both can tell that a bald toothless woman without a nose is not a perfect
incarnation of feminine beauty. "But it does not follow that she would be
very beautiful if she had teeth, nose, and hair, but only if in these and every
other part there was an excellence difficult to describe and represent ... The
intelligence of the pedant extends only to the total of missing parts ... To him
all eyes, mouths, and bodies are equally beautiful: and he would unhesitat­
ingly prefer a woman who has a beauty spot to one who does not although
the second has all her parts most beautifully proportioned and the first is
without any grace or symmetry."? Beauty is not a matter of addition but of
harmony and fitness. Galileo never could bring himself to accept distorted­
circle, that is, elliptical astronomy.

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
13
After much debate, the Alterati decided that sonnets were the highest
form of poetry. Galileo tried his hand at them, and mayhap buried some
in the capacious urn. Here is a specimen, in which a couplet of Galileian
inventiveness follows a Petrarchan opening, and the rest proceeds on stand­
ard lines:
Now that the sun has plunged, its golden curls ablaze,
Into Ocean's waves against Iberia's shores,
The alleyways discharge a multitude of whores
In beautiful platoons attracting every gaze.
The woolen mills close up within the city's maze
Silk weavers stop their work behind their shuttered doors
Birds wheel overhead as a thund'ring tower pours
Forth noise of clanging bells that puts them in a daze.
Townsfolk also flock, to their ancient bridge to tell
The gossip of the day and take some harmless play
Florentines of old thus came to buy and sell.
So I leave you my sweet hope, my dear, fare-thee-well
I'll go to the piazza, where I'll end the day."
The platoon of harlots is well observed as their rush to vespers to atone for
past, and to attract new, business was as sure a sign of evening as the suspen­
sion of other trading."
By and large critics have not appreciated Galileo's poetry. One of his modern
admirers, who ranked him the best master of Italian prose after Machiavelli,
remarks of his sonnets that we are lucky there are not more of them, and
offers the example of the change from Petrarchan sentiment to social studies
in the poem just quoted." On the positive side, Calileo's literary criticism is
still essential reading for expositors of Ariosto and Tasso." The anonymous
editor of the "Considerations on Tasso" who wrote at the end of the eight­
eenth century allowed that most of Galileo's criticisms were sound and that,
if reduced to system, "they would constitute a science of action in poetry."?
Several selections of Calileo's writings compiled to help Italian children learn
to write and think contain ample excerpts from his literary criticism. Like his
science, they illustrate how to combat pedantry and error, reject authority,
and build on reason and experience. Favaro lost no time after finishing his
exhaustive edition of Galilee's works in scavenging them for texts suitable for
use in general instruction. It cannot be said that their study has imbued Italian

14
GALILEO
academic writing with the "simple, geometrical, positive, objective" style that
made Galileo the greatest master of Italian prose between Machiavelli and
Manzoni, nay, the best Italian writer of all time."
The literary sport in Florence during the 1580s incorporated and culmi­
nated decades of disputes over the nature and merit of Dante's tri-part poem,
the Divine Comedy. Do not think it poetry merely because it rhymes and is
sometimes sublime. According to the criteria deducible from Horace's Ars
poetica, the main guide to literary theory of the early cinquecento, a good
poem should edify as well as delight. 54 No doubt, Dante's work gave pleas­
ure; but did it also promote civility, virtue, morality? Yes, because it taught
the ways and wages of sin; no, because it did so through stories that aroused
disgust rather than pity, and has as its hero not a great personage but a pee­
vish poet. Granting that it is a poem, is it a tragedy, comedy, or epic? Dante
called it a comedy, and so it is, because it contains low characters and ends
happily. Yet does its narrative and invention, together with the loftiness of its
theme, not make it an epic?"
To unravel this conundrum, and to ravel many more, critics writing
after 1550 had Aristotle's Poetics in good editions with useful commentar­
ies. According to this authority, an epic, "poetry that mainly narrates," must
meet the tests of unity of action, coherence, and plausibility as well as fur­
nish pleasure and utility with appropriate decorum, imitation, and inven­
tion. Critics who founded their buon gusto on the literal word of Aristotle
complained that Dante's Comedy has no unity. Each of its three parts comes
to its own dénouement through a vast quantity of disparate discursive epi­
sodes of doubtful taste. As for invention, where are the peripaties (reversals
of fortune), discoveries, and sufferings? Dante's journey runs in a straight
line towards an end too easily glimpsed at the beginning. Worse yet, a well­
behaved poet should say little for and about himself; Dante is never off the
stage. Worst of all, the story violates the essential rule of verisimilitude: "It is
fundamentally wrong to make up plots ... compounded of improbable inci­
dents.':" And what does Dante offer? A week's journey through the earth,
up a gigantic mountain, across the planetary spheres, all the way to God,
chaperoned by the shade of an ancient poet and the ghost of a departed
love; interviews with sinners who though dead feel the torments of the
flesh and though suffering unspeakably speak, well and clearly, about the
errors of their ways; and conversations with the saved and the saints, arrayed
eternally without jealousy in order of merit. And there is another violation,

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
15
more monstrous, perhaps, than all the rest: learnedness. Dante strews bits of
astronomy, physics, cosmology, theology, unsuitable to poetry and destruc­
tive of pleasure, throughout his comedy.
The great Dante debate reached its height in 1587. In that year, the
Accademia Fiorentina, founded in 1540 and promoted by the Medici to defend
and propagate Tuscan language and literature, established two lectureships
on Italian poetry and heard praises of the divine comedian from, among
others, Strozzi, Don Giovanni de' Medici, and Jacopo Mazzoni (Plate 6).57
Strozzi's friend Don Giovanni, an illegitimate son of Cosimo I, was a poeti­
cal engineer, musician, alchemist, and astrologer, a man of immense reach,
tolerant enough to befriend his Jewish librarian and brave enough to chal­
lenge Galileo over some problems in applied mathematics." Mazzoni, who
was to be Calileo's special friend and colleague at Pisa, was 40 in 1588, "a
man of the highest level in science, at home in all languages, a most perfect
master in all faculties." Mazzoni had studied at Padua, worked on calendar
reform, edited the Index of Prohibited Books, and begun his defense of Dante
15 years before his performance in Florence." That proved a great success.
Strozzi, also a lifetime defender of Dante, praised Mazzoni's lectures as "full
of profound and marvellous ideas;" the Alterati elected him a member; and
Grand Duke Ferdinando demanded that he accept a professorship at Pisa.
Mazzoni's teaching met every expectation. He was surrounded by students
and professors except when he dined with the grand ducal family, "season­
ing the meal with his arguments."? Called to Rome to teach by Pope Clement
VIII, who had a fondness for philosophy, Mazzoni was about to be made a
bishop when death, having cut down the last of his brothers without issue,
obliged him to marry instead."
In his famous lecture to the Accademia Fiorentina, Mazzoni located the
core of poetry in credible imitation. The poet is not restricted to the false. He
can imitate the truth, even in matters scientific, philosophic, and theologi­
cal, provided that he does it poetically, that is, with accessible and credible
images. Mere versification of a true history or a world picture would not
qualify, however; for although the result might be credible, it would not be
imitation. "Concerning this I have written at length in my new book [Della
difesa della Commedia di Dante, available at all good book stores], where I also
show with what tact Dante has at times introduced either a philosopher or a
theologian to discuss matters pertinent to the contemplative sciences in an
understandable fashion, never deviating from the credible.r'"

16
GALILEO
The loyal Florentine academicians and the independent Alterati had been
at pains to demonstrate the propriety and elevation of Dante's use of science
against those who, like the influential critic Ridolfo Castravilla, objected
to poetry's condescending to "scholastic matters." "Truly, when I consider
Dante's Comedy, I see nothing but a medley, miscellany, and muddle oflearn­
ing that he could have had from any old monk."" The muddle began in Hell
with a complicated staging for which the Florentines had devised a suitable
landscape. It met with objections. The Accademia Fiorentina deemed it nec­
essary to reply. It was a job soon discharged by the Academy's young practi­
cal mathematician, Galileo."
1.3 CHARACTER ANALYSIS
Critical insights
As the Dante dispute culminated, the practiced Florentine academicians
undertook to judge the relative merits of Ariosto and Tasso. Orlando furioso,
published first in 1516 and definitively in 1532, was a product of the high Ren­
aissance, of the time of Raphael, Michelangelo, and Machiavelli. It violates
almost everyone of Aristotle's rules except the pleasure principle." The Furi­
oso is a mixture of Greek myth and medieval romance, and, by operation of
its magic, of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, and fuller than any of them
with episodes that do not advance its scarcely discernible plot. For invention
it has few peers: magic, antimagic, spells and counterspelIs, brave knights
and beautiful maidens in profusion, courtly and carnal love, dragons, duels
and battles, jousts, Amazons. Through it runs an irony that reduces the too­
virtuous knights, the too-beautiful maidens, and the two-timing magicians
to their human equivalents. A master of soap opera and cliff-hangers, Ari­
osto breaks off a fight to the death, a seduction, shipwreck, or hair-breadth
escape to return to an equally fraught situation interrupted a thousand lines
earlier. "I must stop here as there is an English knight demanding to have his
turn." "If my story pleases you, you can find it again later,"?
Two of these stories will indicate the pace and playfulness of the whole.
While the lovesick ninny Orlando disappears for several thousand lines, his
beloved Angelica has many adventures with men and monsters. In one of
these, which later inspired a famous painting by Ingres, a community of

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
17
terrified Scots ties her naked to a rock to appease the hunger of an orc. As
dinnertime approaches so does the knight Ruggiero on a flying horse. He
rescues the luscious maiden and lands on a soft meadow. Too eager for his
reward, he gets entangled in his armor while Angelica, capitalizing on his
fumbling, deploys the magic ring she wears-the only thing she wears­
to make herself invisible. Poor Ruggiero, at last stripped for action, gropes
about like a blind man. "Many a time he hugged the empty air, hoping to
clasp the damsel in the same embrace.?"
Thus saved from himself, Ruggiero was able to concentrate his attention
on his true love, the lady warrior Bradamante. The tale required that they get
together as the Adam and Eve of the House of Este, under whose patronage
Ariosto composed his poem. Bradamante spends most of her time look­
ing for Ruggiero. One evening she is surprised by darkness in a place with
only one castle where she might find shelter. The castle had unusual house
rules. The first knight to arrive was welcomed (or two or three, if they came
together); a subsequent applicant would be housed only if he could defeat the
incumbent(s) in a duel. A similar rule held for women with beauty rather than
valor as the criterion. Three touring Swedish champions were settling down in
the castle when Bradamante demanded accommodation. She easily unseated
the Swedes and took her place at the fireside wearing her helmet. When she
removed it she presented her host with a puzzle. There already was a woman
guest in the castle. Though exquisitely beautiful, she was a hag in comparison
with Bradamante. Could a person who had obtained entry on one ground
also evict on another? The rules did not cover the case. Bradamante improved
the paradox: if the earlier guest had been more beautiful than she, would she
have had to leave? The answer can be found at the end of canto 32.68
The inventiveness, irony, and liveliness of Ariosto's beautifully told tall
tales made them immensely popular. Some 25,000 copies of the Furioso
were printed in the sixteenth century. Verses set to music, by Byrd and Bardi
among others, were sung by admirers high and low, literate and not. Men of
such different good taste as the Galilei, Montaigne, Cervantes, La Fontaine,
Voltaire, Lessing, Goethe, Hegel, Foscolo, and Croce prized the adventures of
Ruggiero, Bradamante, Astolfo, Angelica, and the rest." Who cared whether
the Furioso, the high entertainment of the age, sinned against the conven­
tions? Tasso's admirers. Many of them hailed Gerusalemme liberata (1581), curi­
ously also a product of Este patronage, as more profound and better behaved
if less entertaining than Ariosto's masterpiece.

18
GALILEO
During the half-century that separated the poems, much had happened
to endorse the sombre, even melancholy, tone of the Liberata. The Council
of Trent had tightened doctrine and discipline to meet the Protestant threat.
The popes had set up the Index of Prohibited Books, resurrected the Roman
Inquisition, and nourished the Society of Jesus. The Turks, though defeated
at the naval battle of Lepanto in 1571, still menaced the seas as pirates and
the land as conquerors. The age required a new heroic poem. Tasso's theme,
the great Christian epic of the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in
1099 under Godfrey of Bouillon, hit the mark. It became a favorite among
the Jesuits and almost an official poem of the Counter Reformation." None­
theless it has its budget of magic spells and chivalrous adventures. Not only
were they expected in a heroic poem, but without them Tasso could not have
accounted for his actors, whose heads he supposed to be filled with the old
romances." Of irony, however, there is not a hint. Tasso's idea of fun was a
river whose water causes imbibers to laugh themselves to death. "This river
also makes me laugh my head off [Galileo scoffed] since no one in the entire
work enjoys, has enjoyed, or is willing to enjoy, an iota of laughter.":"
What the Liberata lacks in rollicking good fun and ironic distance it almost
makes up for in seriousness of purpose, unity of plot, and depth of charac­
ter. Tasso's crusaders are not perfect; their heroism stutters, they suffer from
uncertainty, indecision, the human condition. Godfrey sometimes behaves
stiffly or foolishly. Despite his age and wisdom, he swallows the sorceress
Armida's autobiography of virtue and chastity, although her purpose in vis­
iting his camp is to seduce as many of his men as she can. His blindness and
her slowness irritated Galileo. "Madonna Armida, knock it off [stare i madri­
galetti], otherwise Godfrey if he has any brains will figure out that you are a
cheat and send you to a bordello ... " While Godfrey should have been worry­
ing about supplies, troops, the approaching Muslims, and so on, "you [Tasso]
consume 100 stanzas and more retailing four sluttish tricks of Armida and
describing the poltroonery of fifty champions who abandon the army and
their honor to follow her.'?' Later critics tend to agree with Galileo's censure
of Tasso's prolixity and misplaced grandiloquence, although they do not
enter into conversation with him and his characters as Galileo did."
The first serious assertion that the wordy, elevated, melancholy, psycho­
logically penetrating Latinate Liberata was superior to the light-hearted,
superficial, ironic, playful, popular Furioso reached Florence in 1584. Among
the first to the portcullis was Ricasoli, who, giving direction to the Alterati,

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
19
offered the general thesis that "Ariosto merits greater praise than Tasso.'?'
Galileo's "Considerations on Tasso" often parallel the discussions at the
academies, even in their more whimsical parts, although with a bite that has
caused his later admirers puzzlement and even embarrassment." Calileo's
cuts and thrusts should be regarded as material for sprightly debates among
brash young literary men, private notes for knockdown confrontations with
members of the Alterati, who tended to favor Tasso, not formal literary criti­
cism for later depth analysis." He could play very well-against Ariosto as
well as Tasso-the Florentine game of culling barbarisms, Latinisms, inept
words, pedanticisms, stuffing, lard, veneer,"
Calileo's substantive criticism of Tasso may provide deeper insights into
his than into the poet's character. Perhaps his most frequent serious charge
is poverty of invention. "I've always thought that this poet is, in his inven­
tions, above all mean, poor, and miserable, whereas Ariosto is magnificent,
rich, and marvelous." Leafing through the Liberata is like wandering through
a collection of objects "unusual for their antiquity or rarity, but in fact trivial
things, a petrified crab, a dried chameleon, a fly and a spider in amber, some
of those dolls said to come from Egyptian tombs, and, as for pictures, some­
thing sketched by Baccio Bardinelli or Parmigianino, and a thousand other
small things; but as soon as I enter the Furioso, I see opening up a wardroom,
a tribune, a royal gallery with a hundred ancient statues by the most cel­
ebrated sculptors ... and a great many vases of crystal, agate, lapis lazuli, and
other gems, full to overflowing with precious, marvelous things, all excel­
lent.'?" From which we may infer that Galileo prized inventiveness when it
produced great and beautiful things. Pedestrian wonders or out-of-the-way
oddities meant nothing. He would observe this principle in holding back his
small or partial discoveries until the telescope revealed to him the greatest
wonders of the age, and in recommending some of his nicer geometry and
cosmological speculations as marvels.
Love both carnal and committed is also often on Galileo's mind. He
objects to most of Tasso's love scenes that the parties have no clue what to
do. The great champion Tancredi, called out to do battle with the ferocious
Muslim hero Argante, stops en route smitten by the beauty of the warrior
maid Clorinda. Galileo objects. "God give me patience with this man! Ah,
Tancredi, you coward, so there are your heroic acts! Ah, to be chosen above
all others to chastise Argante, and in exchange you stop to make love! What
a hero! And what a nice place you have found for wooing, at least half a mile

20
GALILEO
from the lady ... Ah, Dio, Sig. Tasso, are these really your heroes ... ? While
you, messer Ariosto, have Mandricardo leap out of the bed where he is lying
naked with Doralice at the sound of a call to arms.?" Tancredi's subsequent
lovemaking consists of a few grunts and the unwitting killing of Clorinda,
and of surrender when grievously wounded to the chaste Erminia, who is
better at pharmacy than at flirting."
Tasso could write love scenes, from experience it was said, one of which,
the cooing of Armida and her love-captive Rinaldo, has inspired many
paintings and at least one opera. The scene in Armida's pleasure garden just
before the arrival of two knights sent by Godfrey to remind Rinaldo of his
duty contains the line, "She swoons in his caress I cheeks flushed and bare I
While silver beads of sweat their charms enhance." Galileo: "I've never seen
sweat go white except around a horse's testicles.'?" He objected to explicit
descriptions even in Ariosto. He did not scruple to rewrite couplets in the
Furioso to remove references to a girl's thighs and French kissing."
A usually sound critic has deduced that "Galileo never knew the dreams of
love." The same authority found evidence that Galileo showed a deep insight
into female psychology in one of his notes on Ariosto. Angelica, needing
a manly escort, must choose between Orlando and the King of the Circas­
sians. She chooses the king, not because of his status but because she thinks
that she can govern him more easily than she could the superhero. Galileo:
"A marvelous description of female behavior: and this is one of the reasons
that most women prefer people of lower condition to men held in high
esteem.':" It seems rather the jejune generalization of a jilted young man.
That Galileo had been rejected in this way may explain his admiration for the
behavior of the ferocious Rodomonte when Doralice jilted him for Mandri­
cardo. Rodomonte thereupon prayed that his friend King Agramante, who
had endorsed and enforced her choice, would lose his kingdom so that he,
Rodomonte, could restore him to it, "and make him see that a true friend
ought to be favored, right or wrong, even were the whole world against
him.?" Perhaps it is far-fetched to imagine Galileo as Rodomonte and the
father or brothers of the girl who may have jilted him as Agramante.
Besides love and invention, Calileo's criticism shows a constant concern
for verisimilitude. The line is difficult to define where the miraculous appears
at every turn. Ariosto's wonders seem realistic, because coherent and kept
at an ironic distance; Tasso's often fail, because unnecessarily implausible
and presented as true. Where Tasso gratuitously violates mathematics and

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
21
physics Galileo pounces. From a position on the walls of Jerusalem Erminia
identifies individual crusaders and defenders skirmishing on the plain. "Now
if we calculate that the action takes place over a mile away ... Erminia could
see things that in our time cannot be distinguished even at a furlong." She
must have had an early telescope. Armida's palace offends against all Galileo's
rules for verisimilitude. It has a garden inside and, within the garden, hills,
valleys, woods, caves, rivers, and ponds. It sits on the top of a mountain on
an islet in the Canaries. "The palace must have a circumference of hundreds of
miles, though it is built on a mountain peak; the base of the mountain must
be thousands of miles around; the islet in the Canaries on which it rests must
be the largest island in the world; which runs against the truth, since all the
Canaries are very small.'?" The realistic treatment of the marvelous in Arios­
to's style became a frequent and powerful literary technique with Galileo. His
appreciation of tall tales told realistically would help him to slide easily from
the hypothetical and probable to the true and necessary, as in his eventual
rendition of the Copernican system as something akin to revealed truth.
Delving deeper, we may find that Tasso was out of Galileo's psychological
depth. Tancredi is not a coward but a Hamlet character. Godfrey is a good
leader because he listens and deliberates. Galileo misses the emotion in the
affair of Tancredi and Clorinda, Oscar Wilde's notorious proposition that
"each man kills the thing he loves." He does not like "effusive sentiment
or delicate melancholy.'?" Critics have slated his criticism as too strict and
mathematical, as in his concern over the size of Armida's estate." Was it his
classicism or his conservatism that made him "deaf to the more modern in
Tasso's pathetic treatments'?" The cause lies deeper: Galileo could not toler­
ate ambiguity in character any more than in geometry. He came to judge con­
temporaries, his friends and opponents, in the same black-and-white terms
he applied to fiction. So, although he could praise Tasso occasionally for a
well-turned phrase, as in his description of the façade of Armida's palace,
and even for a good speech, as in Argante's retort to Tancredi at the com­
mencement of their final duel (I weep not for my fate but for Jerusalem's), he
begins and ends his "Considerations" without a nuance."? At the beginning:
"Tasso performs his work roughly, jerkily, and crudely for want of everything
needed for it." At the end: "The rest of the stanza is feeble as usual, meaning­
less, unexpressive, portraying nothing with his usual generalities."?'
Calileo's aversion to complexity of character, which is of a piece with his
depreciation of history, is the obverse of his compulsive attention to linguistic

22
GALILEO
details." He preferred perfecting Ariosto's language to sounding Tasso's psy­
chology. "The persuasive force of Galilco's analysis diminishes as the inspira­
tion and poetic return of the pages examined increase."?' As in literature, so
in physics Galileo dealt more comfortably with the accidents than with the
essences of things. Again and again we shall find him avoiding causal accounts in
favor of mathematical descriptions. The avoidance produced his best work and
some of his worst "marvels," just as it resulted in apt but also in excessive criti­
cism. Calileo's ducking of causal connections in physics and discomfort with
depth of character in literature, and his reliance on mathematics in offense and
defense, had the same psychological roots. Initially the ducking, the discomfort,
and the reliance protected him from risk-taking; but in time they blinded him
to the risks he ran. Galileo's particular genius, his literalness, black-and-white
judgments, hypochondria, and shallow psychological depth perception made
a Manichean personality.
A shrewd critic has described Galilee's argumentative style as a chivalric
duel to the death. "He never takes his adversary by abrupt frontal attack, but
after a courteous greeting stands back to await the first blow. Going on the
defense, he entices his opponent to advance. Suddenly he strikes where least
expected, and, profiting from the surprise, presses in, pushes back, knocks
out his adversary, and withdraws without taking any further notice of the
combat."?' An apt image. "Orlando furioso was always present in [Galileo's]
mind."?' Galileo was an Orlando in argument, and, like Ariosto's paladins,
developed the skill of slicing his adversaries in half without their noticing it.
We need not limit the consequences for science of Galileo's addictive read­
ing to his style of argument or to the clean, crisp, limpid, precise, assured,
ironical, natural, direct style that, he told Viviani, he acquired from frequent
readings of Arioste." There may be much more. "Ariosto, the true painter
of the beauty of nature, helped Galileo in some way in reading the heavens
and revealing the earth, for pictures in the imagination contribute not a little
to inform and direct the meditations of the philosopher."?' We know the
effect of reading and rereading stories of derring-do, of chivalrous knights,
of maidens in distress, of a single hero victorious against an army. We know
it from the behavior of another reader of the Furioso, the melancholic knight
of the rueful countenance, Don Quijote de la Mancha. Was Erminia's tel­
escopic vision present in Galileo's mind when he perfected his spyglass? Did
he recall the competent anonymous nymph of the Furioso, who, "with simple
words moved the earth and stopped the sun," when he meditated about the

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
23
Copernican theory>" Did he remember Astolfo's voyage to the moon when
he began to explore the heavens?
Madness
Duke Astolfo, Orlando's caring cousin and fellow paladin, flew to the moon
in a chariot pulled by winged horses to look for the great champion's wits.
That was perfectly reasonable since all things lost here end up there. The
moon turned out to be a second earth, with rivers, lakes, plains, valleys,
mountains, and spacious forests filled with accessible nymphs." In his lunar
travels, Astolfo came across lost reputations, abandoned loves, discarded
treaties, forgotten charities, faded beauties, everything, indeed, except folly,
"which abides with us on earth," before coming to a mountain of brains
kept in bottles to avoid evaporation. "The one containing the mighty brain
of Orlando was the biggest of them all." Astolfo's amazement at these won­
ders was nothing compared to his shock on finding a small vial containing
some of his own wits, which he had not missed, and other vessels filled
with the brains of people he had deemed perfectly reasonable. There were
wits lost in loving, in putting faith in princes, in seeking honors, wealth,
or some other imagined good. Philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers,
and poets were particularly well represented: "Di sofisti e d'astrologhi rac­
colto I e di poeti ancor ve n'cran molto." Astolfo inhaled his missing wits
and returned to earth with Orlando's and the conviction that everyone is
more or less crazy."?
The earliest documents in which Galileo gives an account of himself con­
cern madness. The account is a byproduct of Calileo's testimony in a court
of law about Ricasoli's mental state during the spring and fall of 1589.101 The
question on which the case turned was whether Ricasoli was in his right
mind when he made his will late in 1589 in favor of a cousin to the exclusion
of his sister. The defense (which sought to uphold the will) tried to show that
Ricasoli had normal dealings with bankers and tradesmen during the time
he supposedly was mad. Would it be right for a merchant to take advantage
of a deranged gentleman? Following this line of inquiry, the court elicited
information that may explain how Galileo, who had no fortune or regular
income, could afford to run with the Ricasolis. Would it be right to play
cards for money with a mad man? And did you, Galileo, not gamble at cards
with the unfortunate Giambattista, and win considerable sums? Galileo

24
GALILEO
admitted to gambling with Ricasoli and others but claimed to have forgotten
the stakes and the winnings. Another gambler, Jacopo de' Medici, testified
that on one occasion he had seen "one of the Galilei" at cards, which sug­
gests that Galileo's teenaged brother Michelangelo might have been involved
in the play too. Galileo recommended himself to Ricasoli and the others by
his general ability and well-stocked mind, and almost certainly also by his
dexterity at casting horoscopes; but he also owed his easy familiarity with
them and his pocket money to his ability at games of chance.l'"
A calculation by Galileo of the relative frequencies of specific throws with
three dice has survived. Its main operative result is that 10 turns up more fre­
quently than 9 once in 108 throws. Only a frequent player could hope to use this
information to advantage.'?' As a good gambler Galileo occasionally bluffed by
raising the stakes on a losing hand-a technique he later identified with the pro­
pensity of his philosophical opponents to add reckless worthless arguments to
bad ones. This criticism applied better to him. His later claims about experi­
mental results and theoretical insights contained a quantity of bluff.
Galilee's account of his fellow gambler's madness is a well-observed clini­
cal history of progressive "melancholy." One evening while the two were
lying in bed together (nothing need be read into this) Ricasoli suddenly
announced that he had to leave Florence immediately because he had com­
mitted great crimes for which the Medici had condemned him to death. For
much of his flight he had the company of his cousin, Giovanni Ricasoli, and
of Galileo, who took care to keep Ricasoli's relatives informed about their
travels. Toward the end of the walkabout, after Galileo had left the company,
Ricasoli wrote the disputed will giving his estate to Giovanni. Galileo testified
to Ricasoli's progress from fear, hypochondria, and sleeplessness to neglect
of person, clothes, and health-a sequence similar to Ariosto's description
of Orlando's descent into insanity, which Galileo thought particularly per­
suasive.'?" Symptoms included fleeing shelter in the middle of the night, talk­
ing of the dead as if they lived, going about in mourning, praying endlessly,
and, in one classic instance, running away from a priest whom he suspected
of coming to administer the last rites before the Medici murdered him. After
a hard and dangerous trip made more perilous by the need to dodge the
priest, Ricasoli's party reached Genoa. He immediately announced that the
following day they would flee to Turin.
That decided Galileo to try to place his troubled friend under medical
care. A stratagem was necessary since Ricasoli supposed that the Medici

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
25
employed doctors as well as priests in their assassinations. At that time a
young nun in Florence aptly named Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi was having
widely publicized visions that revealed among much else that melancholic
fits came directly from God. Perhaps with her revelations in mind Gali­
leo found a monk in Genoa willing to tell Ricasoli that a nun there had
had a vision that a Florentine nobleman afflicted with melancholy would
seek refuge in Genoa. According to the fake vision, God had decided that
Ricasoli had suffered enough. "And because the Almighty operates most
often by natural means, he wanted the gentleman to seek relief in medi­
cines for the causes that, with God's approval, have caused these humors
in the gentleman's body." Ricasoli accepted this charade, compounded of
true concern, invention, and good humor, and put himself in the care of a
doctor. Galileo went back to Florence intending to return to Genoa with
fresh clothes for the furioso. But in a few days Ricasoli was on the move
again, this time to Milan, where he made his will. Galileo saw him only
once again, "more melancholy than ever."!"
In alarm Galileo advised Ricasoli's uncle Lorenzo Giacomini that Ricasoli
"needed very great and urgent care." Giacomini knew something about mad­
ness. In a famous lecture to the Accademia Fiorentina in 1587, he had agreed
with Aristotle that the furor poetico was an affliction of the black bile, that is, a
form of melancholy; when enhanced by astrological influences and wine, it
stimulated "potent phantasms," powerful imaginings, compulsive behavior,
"arising not from one's own discourse and judgment, but from nature.'?"
Alas! doctors neither of the body nor of the soul could cure Ricasoli's furor,
and his expectation of an early death was soon fulfilled.
The court wanted to know how Galileo had arrived at his diagnosis of
melancholy:
Q. How do you know when someone is out of his mind?
Q. By many signs, particularly believing in things entirely false and
impossible.
Q. How do people deranged by melancholy humors act?
A. Some think themselves wild beasts, others that they have monstrous
limbs, others that they are dead, and most, "according to the doc­
tors," fear that they will meet a violent death.
Q. Is a gentleman who prays all the time of sound mind and is prayer
a form of madness?

GALILEO
A. Praying continually is not a symptom of madness since prayer is not
a form of madness.
Q. Is it reasonable or not to think about death and is it a good idea for
a reasonable and prudent man to prepare for it through prayer or
otherwise?
A. Thinking about a natural or violent death may be reasonable as is
preparing for it through prayer and other means.
Q. Is everyone who suffers from melancholy humors mad?
A. Those who suffer much from melancholy humors can be supposed
mad, since melancholy humors are among the sorts of infirmity that
according to doctors attack the mind; and people who suffer from
such humors cannot be deemed very reasonable for only those so
qualify who in all their actions make perfect use of memory, speech,
and imagination.
Q. Have you seen people in Florence with melancholy humors who are
not thought crazy?
A.No.
Q. Can people who take medicine continually have problems and
become delirious about their disease?
A. There are diseases in which the victim usually is delirious, full of
imaginings, and upset by medication.
Galileo had learned something about the symptoms and treatment of dis­
orders caused by melancholic humors in his medical course. As he pointed
out to the court, almost everyone given to study was melancholic. That was
an old association, taught by astrology and confirmed by the pasty faces
of bookworms. A disease caused by a surfeit of melancholic humors that
impeded operations of the mind was something altogether different.'?'
Galileo was to have bouts with melancholy all his life. He was often ill
and in debt, and when solvent and well, worried and hypochondriac. Like
his poor friend Ricasoli, he did many self-destructive things and imagined
himself pursued by a legion of enemies. The last and greatest of his mel­
ancholic acts was his late-in-life challenge to the Roman Catholic Church.
That raised an individual's melancholia to world importance. We know from
the great anatomist of melancholy, Galileo's younger contemporary Robert
Burton, that the condition could produce a conviction of knowing the truth
and a missionary zeal to impose it on others; in its severest form it brought

A FLORENTINE EDUCATION
27
the megalomania that causes its sufferers to found religions.':" Before he
contracted this advanced form of melancholy around 1610, Galileo exhib­
ited only the mild melancholic symptoms of uncertainty, protectiveness, cir­
cumspection, ironic humor, and scholarly arrogance. As a young man and
even well into middle age, he did not appear likely to suffer from paranoia or
hypochondria. He was strong and robust despite recurrent illness, tall and
stocky, with a light complexion, slightly reddish hair, and a look between a
grin and a leer (Plate 3).109
Several copies of the transcript of Calileo's testimony about Ricasoli
exist with vigorous unfriendly marginal comments ("lies ... untruths ... sto­
ries"). The annotator, presumably a lawyer for the defense, supported these
charges by portraying Galileo as irresponsible and unstable. The game with
the priest and the nun was a sacrilege if true and a perjury if false. The sup­
posed sale of his testimony for the sum required to establish his sister in a
convent, a miserable 150 ducats, was doubly contemptible. He was a scoun­
drel, a beggar, the "sfratato figlio d'un maestro di suonare," the unfrocked
son of a music teacher.'!" Galileo's extravagant anger at any accusation of
prevarication ("the greatest abomination") and his tendency to overkill
challenges to his authority may have roots in these baseless attacks on his
character,'!'

A Tuscan Archimedes
2.1 HELL AND MATHEMATICS
Galilee's first known public lectures defended the traditional geography
of the Inferno before its guardian, the Accademia Fiorentina. The tradi­
tion began with the circle of architects and mathematicians around Filippo
Brunelleschi, creator of the magnificent dome of the Florentine cathedral.
Perhaps, as some think, the design of Hell, for which Brunelleschi's biogra­
pher Antonio Manetti has the credit, is just Brunelleschi's dome reversed;
and, indeed, with Zuccari's frescoes of the damned around its walls and the
protruding lantern at its top, the cupola does look like Manetti's Hell upside
down (Plate 15).1 The first version of the Comedy to illustrate his vision, Giro­
lamo Benivieni's edition of 1506, disclosed the plan in a half-dozen maps and
a dialogue between himself and Manetti that later often appeared as a pro­
logue to the great poem.?
Manetti's Inferno as interpreted by Benivieni reached perfection in a lec­
ture to the Accademia Fiorentina in 1541 by Pier Francesco Giambullari.
After consulting a mathematician he drew out his discourse to fill a small
octavo of 150 pages, which he dedicated to Cosimo I for "having given
shelter in the Honored Womb [so it is, Onorato Grembo] of your Florentine
Academy to every muse wanting to develop her most beautiful ideas in [the
Tuscan] language.":' Just as the academicians relaxed in their womb with the
latest news from Hell, a rival interpreter from Lucca, Alessandro Vellutello,
declared Manetti's construction ridiculous and impossible. It occupied, he
thought, an open space equal to one-sixth the volume of the earth, which
he ruled out on the impertinent ground that it could not be mechanically

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
29
stable. Vellutello crammed the whole of Hell within a hundred miles of the
earth's center."
The Florentines threw back the charge of violating gravity and one of them
made a model, to exact measure, to show the stability of the standard model,
"for love of truth ... and a desire to defend Manetti." Dante had known what
he was about. The geography of Hell is a reflection of Aristotle's classification
of knowledge. Physics, that is, natural philosophy, dominates down through
Circle VII, where the Violent reside, as indicated by the naturalistic landscapes.
In Circle VIII, that of the Deceivers, mathematics rules: "and thus we will see
the poet dwelling on the 'how much' and not the 'why'." At the pit of Hell, with
Satan and the traitors, there is only metaphysics, which considers pure form,
pure evil, without any sensible matter," All of which is perfectly credible.
Dante did not give enough information to draw a map to scale and Manetti's
plan as presented by Benivieni and Giambullari was not easy to grasp. The key
datum is the circumference of the ninth of ten concentric ditches making up the
eighth circle. The fact that Dante supplied this datum to characterize a region
reserved for Fraudsters should have been a warning to mathematicians who
thought to exploit the information that the ninth ditch has a circumference of
22 miles.' The number implies a diameter of 7. With the further information
that the diameter of the tenth or innermost ditch is 3.5 miles, and assuming
equal spaces between the ditches, Manetti had worked out that the diameter of
the outermost ditch of the eighth circle is 35 miles," Galileo's task was to derive
the infernal plan from this meager specification and to show "how wrongly
the virtuoso Manetti and the most learned and noble Accademia Fiorentina
have been slandered by Vellutello." The way would be painful, Galileo told
the academicians; he would have to use mathematical terms, Greek and Latin
terms, far from the pure Tuscan in which they delighted.
In Manetti's plan, the Inferno occupies a spherical sector made by rotating
an equilateral triangle, with vertices on the earth's surface and center, around
its height as axis. Galileo displayed his authority and competence by declar­
ing that this sector does not amount to one-sixth the volume of the sphere,
as the corresponding figure of a hexagon in a circle might suggest, but, as
he knew from Archimedes, to one-fourteenth. Hell is a hollow cone that
cuts the earth's surface in a circle whose diameter equals the earth's radius
r (Figure 2.1). Dante supplied measures, though not in the Divine comedy: arc
AJB, centered on Jerusalem, is 3,400 miles (r = 3,245 miles)."

The Inferno comprises nine "circles" arranged in eight levels, like tiers in
an amphitheater. The first four circles have no subdivisions; the fifth and
sixth, which occupy the same level, have three between them. The sixth
level or seventh circle also has three subdivisions, making ten distinct arenas
from the first circle (Limbo) down to the seventh (the Violent). A great pit
below the Violent, which Dante and Virgil negotiate on dragon-back, ends
at the Deceitful, the eighth circle with its ten ditches. Within the innermost
ditch is a deep well guarded by giants, at the bottom of which is the frozen
ground of the Treacherous, distributed into four regions tight around the
earth's center. There stands Satan, or rather his navel; from the waist down
he is inverted and stiff in ice; from the waist up, he dines without digesting,
chewing simultaneously the worst of traitors, Brutus, Cassius, and Judas, in
his three mouths. To find the distances from the devil's belly button to the
centers of all the circles based solely on the diameters of the ninth and tenth
ditches ofMalebolge (the eighth circle), and also to calculate their widths and
circumferences, demanded a grand architectural vision.
Galileo illustrated his vision with two maps, of which one or more ver­
sions may survive in a portfolio of Hell pictures dating from around 1590. It
contains illustrations by Stradano and by Calileo's friends Cigoli and Luigi di
Piero Alamanni (Plate 2).10 While his auditors kept their eyes on some such
maps, Galileo continued with his mathematics. He divided the radius JO into
eighths and the arc BJ, which is 1,700 miles long, into intervals of a hundred
miles (Figure 2.2). To find Limbo, the first tier, he drew the lines 01 and KK.
The piece I, cut off from KK by OB and 01, is the floor of Limbo in the plane
of the drawing; the ring described by rotating I around the axis OJ is the tier

or circle of Limbo. The veriest tyro in geometry then could work out that the
width of I is 87.5 miles. Galileo made a fuss of it and attributed the principle
of the calculation to Archimedes. The width of the second circle, home of
the Lustful, is the piece of Xl, cut offbetween 01 and 02; it comes to 75 miles.
The third circle, of the Greedy, and the fourth, of the Avaricious, are made in
the same way: III = 62.5 miles, IV = 50 miles.

To make room for the three divisions of level five, that is, Circle V (the
Slothful-Angry-Envious and the proud) and Circle VI (the Heretical), 300
miles on earth must be set aside, giving 37.5 miles for the width of each divi­
sion. Circle VII (the Violent), with its three divisions, takes up another 300
surface miles, for a total width of75 miles, 25 per division. This brings the
leading edge of the tier to 175 miles from the axis OJ and leaves a distance
of r/4 to be apportioned between the eighth and ninth circles. We know
that the width of the widest ditch in Vlll is 17.5 miles. Let it correspond to
the remaining 700 miles on the earth's surface. Then it lies at a distance of
17.5r/700 = r/40 from the earth's center, and the great pit between VII and
VIII has a depth of r/lO. The height of the Giant's Well and the Siberia of the
traitors amounts to r/40 = 81 and 3/22 miles. Galileo and Manetti were very
precise. Greater precision can be obtained from the information that the
torso of a giant is about 30 spans or 3 frieslanders or three times the height
of the great bronze pinecone at St Peters; that a giant frozen waist deep set
Dante and Virgil at the bottom of the well; and that Lucifer is of such a size
that his arm is to a giant what a giant is to Dante. Galileo follows up these
data, but we will not follow him.
The challenger Vellutello proceeded oppositely to Manetti, from the
center upward, using the same dimensions for the devil and the ditches
but otherwise building his stingy Stygia from the neat but arbitrary rule
that the rise between consecutive levels equals the radius of the lower one.
The pit between the seventh and eighth circles has a height of 140 miles
and a constant diameter; elsewhere the descent slopes, but not along lines
directed toward the center. These circumstances-the cylindrical pits and
the non-radial inclines-gave Galileo an opening through which to intro­
duce the heavy if irrelevant artillery of physics. II
Giambullari had allowed that the canopy of Manetti's amphitheater­
an unsupported chunk of land 3,246 miles in diameter and, at its great­
est depth, 408 miles thick-would fall into the empty space below it. For
this insight he claimed the authority of Aristotle. In the text in question,
Aristotle taught that a body possessing absolute heaviness (earth) moves
in a right line toward the center of the earth if nothing blocks the fulfill­
ment of its destiny." A stone lintel can sustain itself though not lying on a
line through the earth's center because "cohesiveness" holds it together as
gluons do quarks; but, as Giambullari deduced from Aristotle and Benivi­
eni inferred from common sense, cohesiveness will not span 3,200 miles.

Galileo disagreed. After criticizing Vellutello for building structures subject
to rock slides, he attempted to save Manetti's conical Hell, where, apart from
the canopy, all the tiers are supported by solid earth. And the canopy? It too
is stable, according to Galileo, who here, perhaps for the first time, opposed
Aristotle with a pseudo-experiment. "It is easily shown that its thickness is
sufficient; for a [model] with an arch of 30 braccia needs only a thickness of
four braccia, or even one of a single braccio, or perhaps a half, to sustain it."
Manetti's construction easily provides this security. "Whence we can per­
suade ourselves that in its overall description his Inferno is very much more
credible than Vellutello's."!'
In this typically clever argument, Galileo replaced physics by mathemat­
ics, scaling up his model without regard to the strength of his material. Later
he gave prolonged attention to the problem of the cohesion of solids, and,
as will appear, arrived at the non-Aristotelian conclusion that literally noth­
ing holds them together." The form of Calileo's argument for the stability
of Manetti's vault often recurs in his later polemical writings. The rhetorical
move, "not only is it stable under a scale model, but also under one a quarter
or even an eighth as thick," became more fateful, though not always more
reliable, when transferred from the imaginary world of souls and devils to
the supposedly real one of philosophers and priests.
Many parallels in order and content suggest that Galileo studied Man­
etti's system in Benivieni's dialogue. Benivieni has his interlocutors praise
the invention of an off-stage inventor, a technique Galileo would employ
with himself as beneficiary; and, again like Benivieni, Galileo would leave
his readers no alternative but acceptance of the invention. Benivieni: "If it
is not as you say, it is almost impossible that anything else could agree so
well." Manetti: it is all demonstrated, "by commutated proportion." And
then, with Manetti off stage: "what more is there to say?''" Perhaps this:
when asked to assign exact places to certain sinners, Manetti backed off.
"My scythe does not extend to such crops." Benivieni acknowledged that
the task is not appropriate to a mathematician." Mathematical argument
pursued resolutely in its own right can preempt other considerations, for
example, prudence and forbearance. Dante bothers with exact numbers
only in describing the deceitful and the treacherous. Galileo did not take
the lesson. He would be brought down by pushing the rhetoric and appli­
cation of mathematics beyond prudence, and in a manner not free from
deceit."

2.2 BARYCENTRIC EXERCISES
Galileo launched his mathematical career on a few propositions in the
Archimedean idiom and an instrument to implement the line of thought
that Archimedes had started in the bathtub. As Galileo knew from Vitru­
vius via Buonamici, Archimedes solved theoretically and without invasive
procedures a royal problem with plebian applications: did a crown offered
as pure gold contain a large amount of silver? Archimedes took advantage
of the difference in density of the two metals. Since density (8) is weight (W)
divided by volume (V), he needed a way to measure the volume of the crown
and of samples of the pure metals. His method, inspired by the overflowing
bath, was to drop the objects into a full basin and measure the amount of
water each displaced. Then by weighing them in air he had the information
to deduce their densities. The crown's fell out between those of gold and sil­
ver. Thus did the clean mathematician detect the foul counterfeiter."
Galileo judged this method ill-suited to the dignity of Greek geom­
etry. According to our revisionist historian of science, Archimedes used
a special balance, in which he weighed the samples first in air and then
in water. There was no need for nudity or mopping up. Galileo designed
the necessary apparatus (a little balance, a bilancetta), "which I believe
to be the same as Archimedes used since besides being very accurate it
depends on propositions found in his works."!" In Figure 2.3, the object
h under investigation hangs from B and a counterweight d from A; when
weighed in air, they are in equilibrium around the center C of the bal­
ance arm AB. Now plunge h in water: according to Archimedes' theorem,
it loses weight by an amount equal to the weight of water it displaces.
To recover equilibrium, d must be moved toward C, say to E; then W:w = CA:AE,

where W is the weight of h and of d in air and w is the weight of water
displaced." This solves the problem since, taking 8(water) = 1, 8(h) = W:w =
CA:AE. Let weights of silver and of gold equal to the weight of the crown in
air successfully occupy the place of h, and let the equilibrium positions of d
be E for gold, F for silver, and G for the crown; then its proportion of gold to
silver by weight is as GF to GE.2l
Galileo did not quit here, as Archimedes had, but, with an inspiration both
practical and musical, showed how to measure the required distances accu­
rately. Wrap a couple of windings of a very fine steel wire around E, F, and G,
and fill the spaces between them with tightly wound coils of a very fine brass
wire. The distances GF and GE can be determined by counting the turns of
wire, best done by running a sharp stiletto down them so that both by ear
and feel you can keep the count accurately. But be careful (Galileo advised)
when interpreting the results to note that the order reverses expectation: the
distance of G to the silver mark F indicates the gold content, that from G to
the gold mark Ethe silver." A similar reversal underpinned the theorems on
which Galileo's early reputation as a mathematician rested.
In his treatise on floating bodies, Archimedes stated that the center of
gravity of the figure generated by rotating a parabolic section around its
axis lies a third of the way from base to apex." He offered no proof, perhaps
because he thought it too easy to bother with. That is not how Del Monte's
teacher and Archimedes' editor Federico Commandino ofUrbino saw it. "[It
is] a most difficult and most obscure matter." No one had proved anything
about centers of gravity of solid bodies, as far as he knew. "Unless therefore
I love my own productions excessively, I believe that my treatment will be of
considerable use and a great pleasure to scholars." Galileo did not like it, nor
have later connoisseurs."
Commandino used Archimedes' standard procedure, aptly named
exhaustion, which approximates the area (or volume) of an unknown figure
by inscribing and circumscribing figures with known area (or volume) in
or around it. In Figure 2.4, successive disks of height al4 and ordinates p, q,
r begin the process of exhausting the paraboloid. The volume of the disks is
(naI4)(p2 + q2 + r'). Their individual centers of gravity fall at distances a18, 3a18,
5al8 above 0, and their combined center of gravity or barycenter at some
point X near Q. If AO were a horizontal balance and OX = x, the situation of
Figure 2.5 with k = nal4 would result. For equilibrium, X(p2 + q2 + r2) = (aI8)(p2
+ 3q2 + 5r2). Since we deal with a parabola for which the ordinate along the

axis AO is proportional to the square of the abcissa, r oc 3ajB, q oc 5a/B, p oc
7a/B, if, with Commandino, we substitute the ordinates for the disks' radii.
The solution to this bit of algebra is x < a/3. With more, smaller disks x would
rise toward and perhaps beyond a/3. Commandino removed this last possi­
bility in the classical manner by considering disks circumscribed around the
paraboloid. This time the center of gravity of the disks occupies a point Y >
a/3 above 0 and will decline with more, smaller disks. The center of gravity
of a paraboloid of revolution therefore lies a third of the way along its axis
from its base to its vertex."
Galileo preferred the time-honored technique of solving a different prob­
lem from the one proposed. He offered the situation depicted in Figure 2.6a,
in which a balance arm suspended from its center of gravity at X supports

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
37
a series of weights at equal intervals, the second being twice, the third three
times, and the fourth four times as heavy as the first. Suppose D to be at the
center of the arm and let all the weights a, b, ... have the same value; they have
different labels in the figure to make the analysis easier to follow. The center
of gravity of the five a's is at D; of the four b's, half way between C and D; of
the c's, at C; of the d's, half way between A and C. If they are all moved into
these positions, the balance arm would remain in place: X does not move.
The situation is that of Figure 2.6b: the same distribution of weights obtains,
but in reverse order and with half the distance between successive points of
suspension. (Here is where the bilancetta reversal comes in.) X must therefore
divide the two balances AB, AD in the same proportion: AX:BX = AD:AB

= 1:2. Hence the point X lies one-third of the way from A to B. The center
of gravity of the paraboloid of revolution is an anticlimax. Let it be divided
into disks of equal height as in Commandino's scheme. Since the weight of
each disk is proportional to the area of its base, and since, by the "symp­
tom" of the parabola, this area is proportional to the distance of the center
of the base from the vertex, Galileo recovered the situation of the balance
with an arithmetically increasing load. The center of gravity of a parabolic
section therefore lies along the axis one-third of the way from the base to
the vertex."
The goal of Calileo's play on the balance was to determine the center of
gravity of solid figures. He began with the progression of weights just ana­
lyzed and added to it four others, starting the second under E, the third
under D, and so on. That places a weight of 1 under B, 3 under E, 6 under D,
etc., or, in an obvious shorthand {1,3,6,1O,lS}. The sequence {1,2,3A,S} has its
center of gravity X, at AB/3, counting from A. X2, the corresponding point
for {0,1,2,3,4}, lies at AE/3, that is, at C; similarly X3 lies at (2/3)AC, X4 at (1/3)
AC, and Xs (for {0,0,0,0,1}) at A. Reversing as before, the weights would be
in equilibrium on a lever arm AXI = AB/3 with center of gravity at point YI'
where AYI:BYI = AXI:AB = 1:3. The barycenter of {1,3,6,1O,lS} therefore lies
at C, one fourth of the way from A to B. It would be a good guess that the
barycenter Z. of staggered sequences {1,3,6,1O,lS}, which produce the distri­
bution {lA,1O,20,3S}, lies at AZI = AB/S. Galileo stopped with two sequences,
{1,3,6,1O,lS} + {0,1,3,6,1O} = {lA,9,16,2S}, which gives loading proportional
to the squares of the distances. He deduced that its barycenter y must lie
between those of the constituent sequences, YI and y 2' that is, between AC
and 3AC/4.27
The same can be said for the position of the center of gravity G of a right
cone whose axis equals the lever AB, and whose cross-sections are approxi­
mated by a set of inscribed disks of the same height, as in Figure 2.7, and
by a similar set of circumscribed ones. The barycenter Gi of the inscribed
system lies below, that of the circumscribed system Ge above, G. This is
all that Galileo could get from his technique of reversing weights around
their center of gravity. To show that G divides the axis in the ratio 1:3, he
had to employ the method of exhaustion. He had not developed the appro­
priate analogy with the balance. That would have required dividing the
line AB ever more finely and charging each division according to the law
of squares. For five divisions, {lA,9,16,2S}, the barycenter falls at (lO/n)AC;

for 9 divisions.h.a,o ... 8I}, at (54!57)AC. With increasingly finer divisions, it
approaches C as closely as desired. This would have corresponded to dimin­
ishing the heights of the cone's inner and outer cylinders ad libitum, driving
Gi and Ge toward coincidence at a point one-fourth of the way from the
cone's base to its vertex. Instead, Galileo abandoned the procedure of his
lemma and applied the method of exhaustion directly to the cone in a stand­
ard reductio ad absurdum.28
This result sets up the final proposition, which Galileo regarded as his
special "invention." It states, in the jabberwocky formulations of the old
geometry, that the frustum of a cone or pyramid has its center of gravity
at a point that divides the distance between the smaller and larger bases as
"three times the greater base plus twice the mean proportional between the
greater and the smaller bases plus the smaller base is to triple the smaller
base plus the said double of the mean proportional distance plus the greater
base." In plain algebra, if a and b are the radii (or sides) of the bases, then, if
X in Figure 2.7 is the center of gravity of the frustrum, PX:QX = (3b2 + 2ab +
a2):(3a2 + 2ab + b2). Galileo demonstrated this equivalence through a welter
of opaque proportions based on the clear background idea of the law of the
lever-but not employing his ingenious lemma. Taking the known cent­
ers of gravity of the small and large cones (at A and B, respectively) and the
unknown center of the frustum at X, he had AB:XB = ([B]-[A]):[A], where
the bracketed quantities indicate the volumes of the two cones. From this
equation and the known relationships PA = OP!4, OP:OQ = a:b, [A]:[B] =
a3:b\ the desired ratio, PX:QX = (PB + BX):(QB-BX), can be obtained with the
expenditure of a little algebra."

GALILEO
Galilee's theorems showed his mastery of the ancient methods but did
not command immediate consent. Florentine adepts to whom he showed
them spied a petitio principii, or vicious circle, in his trick of reversing weights
without moving their center of gravity. Had he proved or just assumed that
the center of gravity would remain in place during the mental manipulation
of the weights hanging from it? Galileo appealed to outside experts. He first
approached the dean of Jesuit mathematicians, Clavius, to whom he deliv­
ered his propositions in person in Rome toward the end of 1586. Clavius
encouraged him, not only because of the theorems but also for the sake
of their common discipline. Still, mathematics must be correct as well as
respected, and Clavius suspected that his new protégé had indeed commit­
ted the petitio of which he stood accused. As for the golden proposition, the
center of gravity of a truncated cone, it was too much for Clavius. "I've not
yet had time to review this demonstration. I'm waiting for an opportunity to
refresh my mind about the subject ... "30 A similar answer came from Guido­
baldo del Monte, who happened to have in press a paraphrase of Archimedes
on equilibria and centers of gravity, "a refined and profound science," which,
he thought, still lacked a good demonstration of the barycenters of parabo­
loids and conoids. Galileo's allegedly circular proofs would not do." In fact,
Calileo's reversing trick is sound but irrelevant.
Galileo's answers to these objections were modest but firm: he wrote
with due deference to social position and seniority but perfect equality
in mathematical matters. He sent a more refined version of his argu­
ment; Clavius was not convinced, and hedged. "I am not an oracle." The
Archimedean martinet del Monte soon came around: he had not under­
stood at first, owing (he said) to the conciseness of the argument. Eve­
rything now agreed perfectly and Guidobaldo recognized Galileo as
his master." Whether Clavius ever managed to persuade himself of the
soundness of Galileo's theorems does not appear from the surviving
correspondence. While Italians weighed their judgments, Galileo had
the satisfaction of receiving the endorsement of a mathematician from
Antwerp, Michel Coignet, who received a copy of the theorems through
the mapmaker Ortelius, who had them who knows how. Coignet under­
stood immediately because, he wrote, he had obtained the barycenter of a
frustum of a paraboloid in a manner similar to Galileo's treatment of the
frustum of a concoid. Galilee's way was more general: "your invention is
worthy of acceptance by anyone who cultivates these arts ... and we offer

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
41
you endless thanks for such a favor." In exchange, Coignet propounded
a geometrical problem, "which we solve with a little application of the
procedures and rules of the great art, or algebra."33 That would not have
recommended it to Galileo.
In order to secure ownership of his unpublished Archimedean exercises,
Galileo had them certified by friends of high standing: Bardi, Strozzi, Rica­
soli, and Alamanni." The choice confirms that during his gap years Galileo
identified more with the interests and members of the Alterati than with
mathematical problems and mathematicians. Since the signatories, espe­
cially Bardi and Strozzi, had easy access to the grand duke, they may well
have signaled Galileo's merits to him and joined with the del Monte broth­
ers in recommending Galileo for a lectureship in Pisa.
2.3 DE MOTU
Barro and Buanamici
When he returned to Pisa as professor in 1589, Galileo became the colleague
of his former instructor in physics, Buonamici. Borro too was present, virtu­
ally, through his books and polemics, though he had left for a post in Peru­
gia. Neither practiced physics as we do. Insisting on their role as presenters
of Aristotle's texts in a form as close to the original as they could get, they
did not aspire to develop a new philosophy, or even a new physics." Borro's
concept of his job-"effac[ing] myself before those most eminent men in all
the liberal arts who speak through me ... and from whom I have the science
that makes me what I am"-sufficiently indicates the goods he had on offer.
"I am not one who thinks himself able to find something new."36 Like many
devoted spokespeople, Borro came to live, breathe, and defend the doctrine
that, according to his exegetical principles, he merely transmitted. Michel
de Montaigne, who visited Pisa during Galileo's first year there, discovered
that although Borro could be good company he was "such an Aristotelian
that his ... rule of all sound ideas and true knowledge is conformity with the
teachings of Aristotle; beyond that, there are only chimeras and nonsense.":"
Borro said as much of himself: "there is no logic above or beyond what Aris­
totle teaches, nor any other method than what I intend to teach.':" Careful
and responsible exegetes too easily can take as truths of nature what are only
accurate readings of texts.

42
GALILEO
Borro had not made his mind politically correct when closing it. He
belonged to the Averroistic line of Aristotelian commentators, who dif­
fered over certain points in the capital subject of motion from the Greek line
represented by Buonamici. Believing that Averroes, "a philosopher beyond
praise," had solved all the little problems that troublemakers had raised
against Aristotle's system, Borro saw no reason to read or cite any authority
later than the twelfth century." He was prepared to suffer for his faith. One
of several dangerous old doctrines he taught held that the rotating sphere
of the stars contained the entire universe: nothing lay beyond, no heavenly
bodies, no throne of God. The local inquisitor instructed him to introduce
a Christian heaven beyond the stars. Borro responded by declaring from his
podium, "I have maintained and proved that nothing exists beyond the [stel­
lar] sphere; I've been told to retract; I assure you that if there is anything
there, it can only be a dish of noodles for the inquisitor."? The Inquisition
rewarded Borro's intransigence by maintaining him for a time at its own
expense in one of its prisons. Galileo may well have been Barra's student in
1583 when he returned, shaken, from this last of several incarcerations his
teaching had earned him.
It is hard to find people nowadays who worry whether "simple light and
heavy elements are moved in a straight motion per se and by themselves, or
per alia, by other bodies." For those who do, the Averroistic answer is per se,
the Greek tradition per alia, but in practice both schools took both agencies
into account." Fire, the lightest material, proceeds upward, away from the
earth's center, and earth downward, by their natures, absolutely; whereas air
will fall in fire but rise in water, and water is heavy in air and light in earth.
With these obvious things premised, it is easy to get into trouble. Take the
question whether air weighs (has a tendency downward) in air. No, because
if so the atmosphere would be in perpetual vertical motion; or yes, because
an inflated bladder is heavier than an empty one." Borro chose the second
alternative and so could solve the puzzle why a big chunk of wood falls faster
than a small piece of lead in air but swims in water while the lead sinks.
Wood falls faster because the large amount of air it contains weighs some­
thing in air; it floats because the same air is light in water; whereas the lead,
containing no or little air, is heavy everywhere."
Bodies are moved in natural motion in proportion to their gravity (or
levity) whether absolute or relative, and are slowed in proportion to the resist­
ance of the medium through which they move. Hence, as Aristotle taught, all

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
43
bodies would have the same speed-infinite-in a vacuum. Since that is, or
sounds, absurd, void cannot exist in a peripatetic world. Natural motion does
not occur at a constant speed, however; heavy objects move faster as they
near the earth, light ones as they ascend toward the moon. Why the accelera­
tion? Borro offered several standard explanations and picked "antiperistasis":
propulsion by air continually rushing in to fill the space vacated by the moving
body in order to prevent the formation of a vacuum." He took up several
questions harder even than these, for example, whether another earth would
draw ours or vice versa, and how magnetism works. But since, as he says,
these are most difficult matters in a subject already sufficiently perplexed, and
as Galileo did not follow him there, neither shall we."
During the same year, 1583, when Barro stayed for the last time with
the Inquisition, he published in Florence the third edition of his dialogue on
the tides, Del jlusso e riflusso del mare. Galileo knew this book and proposed the
same title for the work we know as the Dialogue on the two chief world systems
(1632). In both dialogues the author cast himself in the lead role and worked
his way through an entire cosmological system before arriving at the topic
announced in the title-with the difference, to be sure, that Barro wrote to
defend, and Galileo to destroy, the traditional cosmology. Borro dedicated
his book on the tides to the first wife of Francesco I, Giovanna d'Austria,
who had an interest in astronomy. The professor approached the duchess
through the Salviatis, a family tied by interest, intrigue, and marriage to the
Medici. Borro had worked as secretary for Cardinal Giovanni Salviati and
knew the family well; "I was, and will be while I live, and after I'm dead too,
if that is possible, [the Salviatis'] most obedient and affectionate servant.":"
Galileo's spokesman in the Dialogue on the world systems was another Sal­
viati, Filippo, a shoot of the tree Borro tended.
Borro's dialogue, written in Italian to attract the same sort of audience
that Galileo later addressed, takes place in the gardens of the Pitti Palace
under the genial direction of the grand duchess. (Galileo placed his Dialogue
in the palace of a Venetian nobleman who acted as host and master of cer­
emonies.) The discussion begins with Barra's observation that the grand
ducal gardens were much more pleasant in the summer heat than Roman
villas with their midges and mosquitoes and brackish water polluted by the
lead linings of the aqueducts. The duchess suggests that they find something
to talk about that will keep their minds off the temperature. Borro cannot
think of anything. Giovanna: nonetheless you are going to talk, in your usual

44
GALILEO
antiquated way. A third interlocutor suggests the refreshing topic of the tides.
Giovanna agrees: she has heard much learned talk about them but nothing
that made any sense." Barro holds back: he does not know Tuscan perfectly
(he came from Arezzo), knows nothing of modern philosophy and only a
little of Latin literature, and for relaxation reads only Greek and Arabic. He
does not escape. Neither do his auditors." He begins with a brief account of
the main features of the Aristotelian world-its three dimensions, its upness
and downess, its four elements and effective qualities, and so on-and Aris­
totle's explanation of them as expressions of perfection and proportion. Gal­
ilea was to begin his Dialogue in exactly the same place in Aristotle's oeuvre, in
order to reject explanation by perfection."
Another interlocutor interrupts: what has all this to do with the tides?
Barro: "good philosophers always proceed in this way when nothing is
known and everything is sought." A lucid account of geocentric cosmol­
ogy follows, down to the motions of the moon, which brings the discus­
sion to the theory of the tides: they are swellings of the ocean caused by
moonlight. The maximum effect occurs around the meridian passage of the
moon because then the lunar rays strike more nearly perpendicularly and
work most effectively. The company acknowledges that the theory captures
the connection between the moon and the tides. But then, they ask, why do
tides also occur at new moon and under thick clouds? Anyone interested in
Borro's answers will find them toward the end of his treatise."
With these indications that Galileo had learned something from his
former teacher, let us return to the perplexing question whether air weighs
in air. Barra affirmed that it did. He had thrown a chunk of wood and a piece
of iron, which he thought equal in weight but, typically, had not weighed,
from an upper window of his house. As often as he did it, he and his stu­
dents noticed that the wood fell faster than the iron. Buonamici obtained the
same result in a similar experiment of greater precision. Pisa must have been
a dangerous place when its philosophers were thus philosophizing. Borro
explained to survivors that the air in wood counts dynamically but not stati­
cally: the wood and the iron could weigh the same on a balance, where the
included air behaves as a free sample; but when the wood falls, the conveyed
air in it adds its weight to the whole. That a wooden object descended faster
than a metal one of equal weight and similar shape was considered a secure
phenomenon. 51 Belief in it, as well as mastery of the intricate Averroistic tra­
dition, was one of the many debts Galileo owed to Berro."

Pisa's junior professor of philosophy, Buonamici, was more learned and
prolix than his senior, an excellent philologist, and the author of an immense
summa, modestly entitled De motu, of all ideas ancient and modern about
motion. Galileo possessed this compendium and used it as a reference when
developing his own quasi-Aristotelian theories. The size, scope, and depth
of Buonamici's black hole of 1,000 dense folio pages made an optical dem­
onstration of his precept that the doctrine of motion was the core of phi­
losophy." It also gained him a raise in salary of 15 percent, from 330 to 380
ducats, not a bad return on an academic book." Among the many topics
later of intense interest to Galileo treated by Buonamici were the relation­
ship of mathematics to philosophy and the merits of Copernican theory."
Buonamici was willing to allow mathematicians a place at the symposium of
knowledge. "What is absurd in mathematics [he conceded] is also troubling
in philosophy."? But only troubling. Take the absurdity of the famous nova
("new star") that illumined the heavens and darkened philosophy in 1572.
Astronomical observation placed it beyond the moon among the stars and
planets. According to peripatetic physics, however, the heavens consist solely
of "quintessence," a substance neither light nor heavy, constrained to move
in a perfect circle around the center of the universe, and incapable of other
alteration. Philosophically speaking, the nova could not be above the moon.
Mathematically speaking, it had to be among the stars. To the uncomfortable
question, can a mathematical result that "troubles" philosophy kill a physical
theory, Buonamici gave an unequivocal "no."" Galileo would answer loudly,
"yes."
Buonamici dismissed Copernicus' moving earth and central, stationary
sun because they violated Aristotle's demand that philosophy be built on
confirmed, everyday, commonsense experience. Among the obvious contra­
dictions to experience Buonamici adduced was the thought experiment that
Galileo would later claim in favor of Copernicus: dropping a weight from
the mast of a moving ship. According to the teacher, the weight would fall to
the poop; according to the student, at the foot of the mast. 58 Perhaps neither
tried it. Buonamici insisted not only that the earth rest, but also that it be
absolutely still, a rhetorical overkill that might have been directed against
one of his colleagues, Andrea Cesalpino, a professor of medicine at Pisa.
Cesalpino had the pretty taste of decorating the walls of his house with trian­
gles from Plato's creation myth Timaeus and balls from the escutcheon of the
Medici. Buonamici did not aim his criticism at this curiosity, however, but at

GALILEO
Cesalpino's suggestion that the earth might dance in place to produce some
subtle (and spurious) astronomical phenomena deduced by Copernicus and
in the process, by shaking the ocean basins, create the tides."
For the rest, Buonamici was as strong a defender of the libertas philos­
ophandi as Borro and perhaps more anticlerical. He introduced the species
"priest" into the Aristotelian classification of sentient life as a link between
man and beast. In none of these animals, human or not, did Buonamici
allow an immortal soul. A religious friend, a follower of the Thomistic syn­
thesis, asked him if he had read St Thomas. Answer: "I don't read books by
priests."? Like Borro, Buonamici had many powerful friends in Florence,
beginning with Grand Duke Cosimo I. Unlike Borro, he had a strong inter­
est in modern literature. It did not take him far from Aristotle, however, as
he won election to the Accademia Fiorentina with a lecture on Aristotle's
merits as a literary critic."
Alexander and Dominicus
Galileo's official teaching at Pisa did not go beyond the Elements and the
Sphere, that is, the first five books of Euclid and a commentary on the Sphaera
of John of Sacrobosco, a short summary of the first principles of astronomy
composed 450 years before Galileo began to teach it. He served it up from
Clavius' Commentary (1581), which, at thirty times the size of the original, was
neither brief nor elemerrtary. Of original mathematical work by Galileo dur­
ing this period there is not a trace. In addition to the Elements and the Sphere,
Galileo taught astrology to medical students who needed it to determine
when not to bleed a patient. The important connection between astronomy
and medicine is nicely caught by Calileo's request that his father send him
his seven-volume set of Galen and his "[armillary?] sphere."? The letter con­
taining the request goes on to announce another important connection. "I
intend to study with and learn from Sig. Mazzoni, who sends his regards.
And having nothing more to say, I close."
Mazzoni, the defender of Dante, inspired the entire university by the
breadth of his learning and the size of his salary. For 700 scudi a year he
was reworking his earlier contribution to the philosopher's equivalent of the
argument over the relative excellence of Ariosto and Tasso: who is to be pre­
ferred, Plato or Aristotle? Mazzoni's first answer, published in 1576, was "nei­
ther and both"; rightly understood, the Titans of truth had to agree with one

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
47
another." In his maturity, Mazzoni realized that the Titans conflicted over
many matters of mathematics and metaphysics. Was Plato right in affirming
that mathematics best described the constitution of matter, or Aristotle in
placing quantity among the least important of nature's accidents? Did the
philosopher come closer to the truth by exploring the few mathematical
ideas he found in his head or the vast range of experience presented by his
senses? Mazzoni decided that Aristotle, otherwise reliable always or for the
most part, had gone astray by neglecting the quantitative aspect of things."
There exist among Galileo's papers paraphrases of lectures on Aristotle's
physics, particularly on questions related to difficulties it raised for Chris­
tians, and on Aristotle's logic, particularly syllogistic and mathematical
demonstrations, given originally at the Roman College, the central Jesuit
university." Neither the date nor the purpose of Calileo's reworking of this
material is known, but from the years in which the courses were given and
the paper and handwriting of Galileo's paraphrases, very probably they date
from the period of his professorship in Pisa. Their purpose? Perhaps Galileo
wanted to bone up on Aristotle for discussions with Mazzoni or prepare for
teaching philosophy in Mazzoni's concordist manner. That might explain
why Galileo turned to Jesuit material, which he might have had through
Clavius or the well-read Mazzoni, since, contrary to the teaching of Borro
and Buonamici, the material remained within the Thomistic synthesis."
Many of the positions represented in Galileo's paraphrases came from St
Thomas himself, including the resolution, in God's favor, of the awkward
problem of establishing any certain truth about the physical world in the
teeth of His omnipotence. For if He can do as He pleases short of contradic­
tion, He might have made the world operate in ways unlike those established
by our strongest demonstrations." Galileo would devote much of his time to
repudiating this proposition.
In exchange for guidance in philosophy, Galileo could offer Mazzoni help
in looking for decisive examples of the errors Aristotle had committed by
depreciating mathematics. He did not have far to seek. The tangled problems
of motion that had caused Borro and Buonamici to fill the air with missiles
offered many attractive targets.
On Motion. A brief visit to Buonamici's black hole will suggest how hope­
lessly twenty centuries of commentary had perplexed the questions of free fall
and projectile motion. Aristotle explained the acceleration of heavy bodies
as a natural consequence of their gravity, their tendency to rush toward the

GALl LEO
center of the universe. His commentators were not satisfied. They proposed
that gravity was a consequence of place, or of a pull toward the center, or
of a push from the air. Acceleration occurred because gravity continually
added new motion to that already present; or because a body, when it began
to fall, possessed an unexpressed "impetus" that held it aloft, and gradually
died away, like the heat of a pot removed from the fire; or, finally, because of
still other principles, the overcoming of obstacles, the nature of the moving
body, all of which might accidentally become causes of motion. And free
fall was the easy case! Objects thrown, propelled by the wind, extruded like
bubbles from water, and so on, did not move freely. In such cases, how does
the "violence" of the initial mover survive in the mobile, and how does the
original impulse lose its force? Does the air help or hinder the motion? Does
the natural motion, free fall and its tendency, act together with the violent
motion throughout, or only after the violence has declined to equality with
nature, or to zero?" It was from these catacombs that Mazzoni hoped to
gain release with a little help from mathematics and Galileo.
Something of the content of their conversations can be inferred from Maz­
zoni's concordist treatise, In universam Platonis et Aristotelis philosophiam praelu­
dia, not printed until 1597, Galilee's response to it, and Galileo�s unpublished
writings "De motu antiquiora." These last consist of scattered notes, a brief
dialogue, and two drafts of a treatise, all in Latin. They date from around
1590.69 Following a hint from Favaro, the dialogue can be read as a record of
the lost conversations between Galileo and Mazzoni." One of its interlocu­
tors, Alexander, identifies himself with Galileo by claiming invention of the
bilancetta. The other, Dominicus, is a composite of the Pisan students and
teachers with whom Galileo used to walk and talk, "disputing over many
beautiful and pleasant things." We owe this vignette of literal peripateticism
to a fellow student, Luca Valerio, the last great representative of the school
of Commandino, to whom Galileo later ceded the palm of "the Archimedes
of our age" for his prowess in locating centers of gravity." Their center of
discussion, however, was Mazzoni."
Galileo's dialogue "De motu" begins as Dominicus literally runs into Alex­
ander. "That trite old adage, 'motion is the cause of heat,' does not hold well
for me," he says; his running has not kept him warm. Alexander agreed to
test the question further in a brisk walk and talk. Dom: "What shall we talk
about?" AI: "The first thing that comes into either of our heads." Dom: "What
about what I just mentioned?" AI: "And what was that?" Dam: "I said, 'that

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
49
trite old adage .. '" A thorough study of heat was too great a subject for a
walk, however, as it required frequent reference to Aristotle, whose works
on physics Dominicus and Alexander had studied carefully as had Galileo."
Even the motion of light and heavy bodies, as treated "most exactly by Giro­
lamo Borro," would have been too much." So Dominicus proposed a few
questions raised by his reading. They were:"
1. Does a point of rest intervene "at reflection," where a body thrown upwards
begins its descent?
2. What reason can you give that a wooden body of equal size with an iron one
will fall faster though it is lighter-if you accept that it will?
3. Why is natural motion faster at the end than at the beginning, and violent
motion faster at the beginning than in the middle, and faster in the middle
than at the end?
4. Why does the same body descend more speedily in air than in water, yet some
bodies fall in air but float in water?
5. What reason can you give that a cannon ball carries further in a straight line
if fired at an angle than if fired horizontally, although the vertical is more
opposed to natural motion?
6. Why do the same guns shoot heavier balls further than light ones, and iron
balls further than wooden ones, although the lighter offer less resistance to
the "impelling force"?"
Dominicus adds the impelling force of flattery to pull a response from
Alexander. "You are accustomed to the cleverest, most certain, and subtlest
mathematical demonstrations, like those of the divine Ptolemy and the most
divine Archimedes."?
Subtle Alexander sets forth. "In violent motion, a certain impressed
virtue ... " "Hold on, hold on," Dominicus objects, "we must go slowly ... Aristo­
tle says that this motion is caused by the medium [not by a virtue impressed by
the thrower]. Do you think that this opinion of Aristotle is wrong?" What an
opening! The sun was now climbing, the weather warming, and the philoso­
phers of motion moved off toward the seashore, for a good lunch of fresh fish,
while Alexander multiplied reasons against Aristotle's teaching that a projec­
tile is pushed by air impelled by a virtue impressed on it by the projector. If
antiperistasis worked, how could cannon balls carry against the wind? Or a
marble sphere spin while the surrounding air remains still?"
The discussion took a fresh direction. Dom: "I would like to know why
nature [places heavy bodies under light ones] and not the reverse." The

50
GALILEO
tentative answer: "Heavier bodies are closer to the center because things
are heavier that contain more matter in a smaller space." By "heavier bodies
[graviora]," Alexander explains, he means denser ones." He rejects altogether
the concepts of absolute heaviness and lightness, of gravitas and levitas; "gravia
and levia can be taken only relatively." Dominicus demands proof. Al: We'll
be at this forever if I must disprove Aristotle whenever I disagree with him.
Dom: Our conversation will be brief if you do not. Alexander obliges with
a formal definition. "A body is said to be heavier [gravius] than another if it
weighs more by volume when weighed in the same medium." Dominicus
at first does not understand the need to decide relative gravitas by weighing
equal volumes. Nor does he immediately see the bearing of the medium. To
bring him around, Alexander delivers a short lecture on Archimedes' hydro­
statics, illustrated, as ifby the master himself, by drawings in the sand."
Dom: "These [ are] most plain and certain demonstrations. I see that all
those philosophers are wrong who say with Aristotle that air is more
heavy than light because it helps heavy bodies fall more frequently
than it helps light ones rise." Al: "Oh ridiculous chimeras! ... Immortal
gods, how, please, can anybody believe in them since the contrary is
obvious to sense?"
Thus prepared to surpass their teachers, our philosophers take up the conun­
drum that had bothered Borro. Do elements gravitate in their proper place?
Al: No. Dominicus was not used to such clarity. Dom: "Oh what a beautiful
answer! How true and beautiful a solution!"
Let us turn to the point of reflection, where a body flung upward begins
to descend. There is no rest there, Alexander declares, it is merely the place
where the impressed force, the vis impressa, of a violent vertical motion equals
the gravity of the projectile; and since this vis loses its strength in producing
its effect, the equality at the top of the path is fleeting. Thereafter the vis con­
tinues to run out as the body's gravity overcomes it. What appears as accel­
eration, says the subtle Alexander, is rather progressive loss of the power to
rise: if there were a tower high enough that in falling from it the violent vis
would vanish somewhere, the body would proceed from that point on with
constant velocity determined by its gravitas and the nature of the medium."
Dom: Very good. Now what about motion in a vacuum? AI: No problem,
no impediment. A heavy body that moves more quickly in air than in water

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
51
would move faster in vacuum than in air. If so, says Dominicus, Aristotle was
wrong again, since he claimed to demonstrate that motion would be instan­
taneous in a vacuum on the ground that velocity increases as resistance
diminishes. AI: Aristotle did not prove the inverse proportion to resistance,
and he would have tried in vain, as it is false. The correct relation is arithme­
tic: a body's velocity in natural motion is given by the difference between
its gravity and that of the medium. Its speed in vacuum is fast but finite.
Dom: "Oh! Subtle invention, most beautiful thought! Let all philosophers
be silent who think they can philosophize without a knowledge of divine
mathematics! "82
Now warmed to his work, Alexander observes that Aristotle's principle
that the velocity of a freely falling body is proportional to its weight conflicts
with his proposition that a body composed of different elements descends
with a velocity slower than the fastest and faster than the slowest compo­
nent. Take a small lump of lead A and a larger piece B. Joined together A+B
should fall more slowly than B, which would be held back, on Aristotle's
hypothesis, by its companion A. But again, if velocity did depend on weight,
A+B should fall faster than B. If, however, downward tendency depends on
density, the argument fails. In vacuum, where velocity is rigorously propor­
tional to density, "the denser (graviora) falling faster than the rarer (leviora),"
ten pounds of lead would fall as fast as 100 pounds in vacuum."
A difficulty occurs to Dominicus. Bodies dropped accelerate downward
just as if they had been projected upward and let fall from the point of
reflection. How did they acquire the equivalent of the vis impressa without
the preceding violent motion? AI: It comes from the shelf or hand that
supported them against their gravity. Thus all freely falling bodies appear
to accelerate initially. However, if you throw an object downward with a
force equal to its gravitas, you can kill its residual vis impressa and bring it
immediately to its constant terminal velocity. The effect will be hard to
spot, however, because a constant motion can appear to be accelerated. In
Figure 2.8, the body falls in equal times through the equal spaces Be, CD,
DE. Observed from A it seems to accelerate since the eye estimates the
distances covered by the angles subtended, and angles BAe, CAD, and DAE
progressively increase."
On Mathematics. Mazzoni employed the core of Alexander's doctrine­
the arithmetical rule for velocity with the consequence of finite motion
in vacuum, relative weight, and no gravitas in place-in pointing out where

c
Aristotle had propagated opinions "altogether false and absurd ... because
he did not subject his ideas to the test of mathematics.':" For example, had
Aristotle considered the continuity of motion mathematically, he would
have known that there is no rest at reflection. Every astronomer easily could
read as much from the usual theory of the planets. In Figure 2.9, P is a planet
describing an epicycle around C; the line of sight AP from earth intersects
the line connecting the turning points N, D, at T. As P moves from N to U, so
does T; and, since the planet's motion is continuous, so must T's be, although
Aristotle (and common sense!) might suppose that T rests between changes
of direction." Galileo gave a similar argument in his treatise "De motu,"
with the significant difference that he referred to one of Copernicus' models
(without endorsing the Copernican system) and Mazzoni to one by Regi­
omontanus, the finest Ptolemaic astronomer of fifteenth-century Europe.
Further to the attack, Mazzoni criticized Aristotle for teaching that there is
no proportion between a curve and a straight line. So did Galileo. And both
moderns invoked ancients to make their case: Euclid and Archimedes. The
presence in Calileo's "De motu antiquiora" and Mazzoni's Praeludia of these
two similar, precisely aimed sallies confirms their interdependence."
Fifteen years later Mazzoni sent Galileo a copy of his book containing his
exposure of the errors in physics that Aristotle had committed by neglecting
mathematics. "I am particularly pleased and gratified [Galileo replied] in seeing
that you tend to accept the position 1 believed to be true and you opposed during
the first years of our friendship, when we disputed so merrily. Perhaps you did
that [took the part of Dominicus] to display your ready wit, which enables you
to sustain false views when it pleases yOll to do so; or, perhaps, to save in every

direction.
A
small detail the honor of the teachings of that great master [Aristotle] under
whose banner all those do and should march who investigate the truth.'?" Now,
the main weapon with which they belabored their master was the arithmetical
rule of fall (velocity is proportional to the difference in densities of the body and
the medium) that lent itself to physical interpretation via Archimedes' hydro­
statics. Very likely Galileo learned the rule from Borro, who knew it from Aver­
roes, whereas Mazzoni, who, unlike Borro, had not stopped his reading in the
twelfth century, had it from the court mathematician Benedetti. 89
The hydrostatic analogy employed by Benedetti, Mazzoni, and Galileo
yielded much more than a semi-quantitative rule of fall. It also contained a
discovery of utmost importance, the discovery of nothing, that is, nonbeing,
emptiness, the Archimedean limit of finer and finer media. Galileo would
build his new science of motion on emptiness just as modern cosmology
pulls the universe from the "vacuum." The hydrostatic analogy to free fall,
however, eventually would have to go. Just as Dante had to part from Virgil,
who had piloted him through darkness when the true path was lost, at the
top of Purgatory, where he began his climb to the source of all light, so Gali­
leo would have to discard the Archimedean reasoning that took him toward
the edge of the Aristotelian cosmos. The extension of hydrostatics, which
deals with the equilibrium of bodies at rest, to motion is as difficult to per­
form as the introduction of a heathen into Heaven.
Besides giving direction to Galilee's thought within the taxingly com­
plex Aristotelian teachings about motion, the discussions with Mazzoni in

54
GALILEO
Pisa in the early 1590S helped to raise Galileo's sights above the usual busi­
ness of mathematicians. Mazzoni allowed them not only a say, but even a
veto, in pronouncements about physics made by philosophers. Calileo's
unpublished treatise "De motu antiquiora" responded to this encourage­
ment. It expanded and formalized the ideas developed by Alexander in his
conversation with Dominicus and cleaned up their vocabulary. The trea­
tise recognized that upward motion must always be forced and that the
only natural motion is toward the center of the universe." And the treatise
improved on the dialogue by offering two tests of the theory.
One concerned a problem that Galileo claimed to be brand new with him:
why heavy bodies moving down planes inclined at various angles to the hori­
zon go more quickly along those most nearly vertical. The answer turns on
an analogy between descent along a plane and the motion of a balance arm.
In Figure 2.10, the arm CD pivoted at A ends in the equal weights c, d. The
weight d tends vertically downward at 0 along EF with a force measured by,
let us say, the distance AD. Now suppose that d sits at S on the inclined plane
HQ so placed that AS = AD. According to Galileo, d would move along HQ
with the same force that it would exert if suspended from CD at P. Thus the
"force" and so the speed with which d falls along EF is to the force and speed
with which it moves along HQ as AD to AP. But from the similar triangles
APS, HGQ, AS:AP = HQ:QG, or, what is the same, AD:AP = HQ:DF; that is,

the speed of the vertical motion is to that of the oblique motion as the length
is to the height of the inclined plane."
Or so it is in the ideal, mathematical case, free from all resistance, either
from the plane or from the sliding weight, an unattainable condition, which,
as Galileo observed, made experimental confirmation impossible. (Another
reason the test would have failed is that Galileo's proposition is false.) In the
limiting case of motion along the horizontal, however, the analysis delivered
something new and almost true. As the horizontal is nothing but an inclined
plane with no inclination, an infinitesimal push should be able to move the
weight along it indefinitely. Not quite. Speaking ideally, any displacement
along the horizontal implies a rise; but the amount would be very small for
any realizable experiment, indeed negligible, just as is the departure from
parallel of the directions of fall from the ends of a balance arm. Archimedes
had been content to employ such idealizations and abstractions. "He did so
perhaps to show that he was so far ahead of others that he could draw true
conclusions even from false assumptions ... [Let us call it] a case of geomet­
ric license."? A pity that the geometer cannot correct for the myriad ways in
which material bodies escape from his control! That is exactly why philoso­
phers denied mathematics a significant role in physics.
While idealizing and abstracting, Galileo considered the rotation of a
sphere whose center coincides with that of the universe. On his principles,
the motion was neither violent nor natural, since the sphere's barycenter
would not approach or recede from the center to which all bodies tend.
Would it spin indefinitely? Galileo raised the question without deciding it.
We may infer his likely answer from his teaching that a homogeneous sphere
turning around its center of gravity at the earth's surface would rotate forever
were there no friction at its bearings or against the air." The natural motion
of its falling parts compensates the violent motion of its rising parts. Despite
their apparent relevance to the Copernican world picture, these considera­
tions stay within the framework of the Aristotelian system, preserving and
exploiting the concepts of natural and violent motion, assuming a central
earth, and supposing the heavens to rotate. Galileo's spinning marble ball
very probably modeled not world systems but grindstones.94
Experiment appeared equally incompetent to test the cornerstone of Gali­
leo's Pisan mechanics, the arithmetic rule for falling bodies. He could find no
tower tall enough, even in Pisa, for the experiment. The lightness supposedly
acquired by being out of place would not wear away completely during the

GALILEO
descent, and the falling body would never reach the constant velocity fixed
by the rule. The test was compromised further by the expectation that in free
fall wooden balls outpace lead ones at first, a "fact" that Galileo claimed to
have tested "often" from a high tower. What could be the reason for so pecu­
liar a phenomenon? Answer: the impressed force is less in wood and at first
dies away faster that the corresponding force in a heavier body. "Oh, how
readily are true explanations derived from true principles!" But then, why
should the greater gravity of lead not kill its impressed impetus as quickly as
the lesser gravity of wood does its? "This objection surely has great weight."
Did Mazzoni make it? The answer depended on a false dichotomy. The impe­
tus departs, of itself, during the motion, just as hot objects lose their heat
when placed in the cold. And as heavy bodies cool more slowly than light
ones (as appears from comparing rates at which an oven and a pie removed
from it lose heat), so lead retains an impressed motive force more tenaciously
than wood." Here the legacy of the Aristotelian doctrine Galileo proposed
to better kept him as fully entangled as it did Borro or Buonamici. It would
take him twenty years to get free.
2.4 GALILEO AT 25
A wedding in Florence
During May 1589 the Medici threw the grandest party that Florence had
ever seen. The occasion was the wedding of Grand Duke Ferdinando I and
Christine (Christina) of Lorraine, the granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici,
one-time queen of France. The grand duke was then 40 and a duke of only
20 months' standing; previously, for as many years, he had been a cardinal,
though without the help of holy orders. His accession was greeted with relief,
since his predecessor, his brother Francesco I, had almost all of the vices and
none of the virtues of the family. Ferdinando had the opposite mix of vir­
tue and vice and his lavish wedding, in which the entire city participated,
cemented his popularity. His bride had the merits in his eyes of advertising
Tuscany's liberation from the Holy Roman Empire, to which Francesco had
tethered it, and of being uncompromisingly devout (Plate 10). Galileo would
take some career steps and missteps based on his calculations of Ferdinando's
patronage and Christina's piety.

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
57
Galileo's patron Bardi and the architect Buontalenti had overall respon­
sibility for staging the centerpiece of the celebration. This was a seven-hour
theatrical extravaganza: a five-act comedy (the usual form) surrounded by six
intermezzi, each a technological wonder. The poet and architect had worked
closely together before on a similar but lesser performance for the wedding
of a Medici and an Este in 1586.96 The play for 1589, entitled La pellegrina, dealt
with the travels of a pious lady. Bardi supervised the staging, designed the
costumes, and worked out the intellectual program. The symbolism he con­
cocted for the intermezzi floated above the heads of his audience like the
clouds crowded with deities through whom he developed his allegories. Only
an intimate of the Alterati or an unusually informed philologist could under­
stand, though everyone could enjoy, the spectacle. The music too echoed
with a combination of the learned and the emotive, as Bardi fashioned some
of it on the same principles on which that "great genius," his friend Vincenzo
Galilei, had composed the lament of Ugolino. 97
Buontalenti designed the stage settings, curtains, and backdrops and also
the machinery required to lift mountains and devils through trap doors,
cause the clouds packed with actors to float, and effect instantaneous changes
of light and scene. A hundred men worked the winches, pulleys, and miles
of rope employed during the performance. This, however, represented but a
fraction of Buontalenti's assignments. The theater in the Uffizi had to be refit­
ted, the Palazzo Vecchio expanded and reconfigured, and the gardens of the
Pitti finished and furnished with a temporary water stage for a mock naval
battle." Meanwhile Bardi was setting poems furnished by G.B. Strozzi. These
included several madrigals for the fourth intermezzo, which starred the Prince
of Darkness. It began with the opening of a trap door from which poured
demons wearing silk costumes that looked like snakeskin. Beneath them souls
crackled in flames. Charon the Hellish boatman could be glimpsed as Dante
described him, and Lucifer, standing tall from the waist up above the deep
freeze that contained the rest of him, munched sinners as in Dante's menu.
During the action, the devils on stage sang a dirge, lyrics by Bardi, lamenting
that their business would decline under the gentle reign of Ferdinando and
Christina. When they finished, the whole scene, devil and all, vanished in a
puff of fire and smoke. "The goal of the intermezzi," says Strozzi, "is to stu­
pefy every viewer with their grandezza." An engraving of Buontalenti's stage
set has survived. It was based on Benivieni and Manetti with some advice, we
may presume, from the local expert on infernal cartography."

GALILEO
Galileo could have participated in the wedding extravaganzas in several
other ways as well. Florence had no unemployed artists during preparation
for the wedding and no unemployed musicians during it. Ferdinando's staff
had to comb the countryside for monks who could sing and gentlemen who
could play. Galileo was an expert lutanist. He was also one of those "noble
youths" urged to appear as extras, to carry the canopy that shielded Chris­
tina and her retinue in the streets, to compete in the joust staged before the
church of Santa Croce, or to battle in the naumachia of 18 galleys fought in
the artificial basin in the cortile of the Pitti palace. The urging was reinforced
by the threat of a fine for absence without a doctor's excuse.'?'
People from as far as Rome and Venice lined the streets on the morning
of Palm Sunday, 30 April 1589, to watch Cristina's progress to the Duomo,
which blazed under the light of 38,000 candles. During the ceremony, a cloud
filled with angelic musicians descended from the cupola, whose frescoes
Cigoli, Zuccari, and others had only recently completed, to rest in front of
the astonished bride.'?' All Florence then banqueted, Galileo and his family,
parents, brother, and elder sister, as guests of the Ricasolis. We know this
particular because during the hearing on Ricasoli's sanity the court asked
whether his expenditures in connection with the wedding were excessive.
The court: Is it laudable and proper for a prudent and sound youth, on
the occasion of the wedding of his sovereign, as an honor to himself
and his family, his city and his prince, to do something out of the ordi­
nary and spend money on literary men and fancy clothes?
Galileo, for the literary men: It is worthy of praise.
The fancy clothes referred to a costume that, if completed, would have cost
300 scudi, or five times the annual salary Galileo would receive at Pisa.102
Dressing up was ubiquitous as well as praiseworthy and an important
ingredient of the display of 1589. Chroniclers dwelt on the beauty of the
gowns and the women in the audience of La pellegrina as Ariosto did on the
charms of Alcina and Angelica. All participants in the parades and public
events received new livery. The costumes of the gods and heroes who inhab­
ited the clouds were so thickly tricked out in gold and jewels that, accord­
ing to an eyewitness, "it might well have seemed to everyone that Paradise
had opened up, and become the entire stage and setting." The costumes for
the intermezzi alone consumed three miles of cloth of all sorts, silk, satin,

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
59
velvet, wool, which works out to 18 yards each. Many actors and singers
would not have been more heavily burdened if they had worn chain mail.
The 300 costumes for the comedy and the intermezzi cost 100 scudi on
average. Ricasoli was only a little extravagant.'?'
Galileo attended the comedy and intermezzi at the grand opening on
2 Mayor, perhaps, at subsequent performances (with different comedies)
later in the week.'?' Whether employed as an extra or a musician, or seated
as a guest of Bardi or Ricasoli, Galileo was present among the Florentine
patricians with whom he identified. Two years later, in 1591, a key link to
them broke with the death ofVincenzo Galilei, which further compromised
Calileo's lifestyle by making him responsible for the welfare of his mother,
brother, and sister Livia, and for the balance on Virginia's dowry still owing
to her impatient husband, Benedetto Landucci. Galileo's salary of 60 scudi,
which, though not high, was well above the lowest in the university, did not
suffice to meet his new obligations. Nor had he been able to save anything.
During his first year as a Pisan professor he spent so much time in Florence
attending to a serious illness of his mother and to the Ricasoli affair that he
had to engage a substitute and forfeit pay, which dropped his income from
teaching to a little less than the wage of a good tailor.'?' He had made Virginia
a substantial gift on her engagement, going, as was his wont, directly to the
point: the marriage bed, complete with fringed hangings of silk, purchased
and made up in Lucca "for a very good price." Galileo had learned something
from his father's brush with trade, although, as a would-be literary man, he
denied all knowledge of business.!"
Tower and toga
We have it on Viviani's authority that Galileo dropped different weights of
the same material from Pisa's Leaning Tower to show, "to the dismay of the
philosophers," that, contrary to Aristotle, they all fell at the same speed. And
he did it not once, or secretly, but "with repeated trials ... in the presence
of other teachers and philosophers, and the whole assembly of students."?'
Iconoclasts have thrown doubt on this vignette although the tower's tilt
made it a perfect platform for the experiment. They objected that no one
among the literate throng supposedly present, not even the peripatetic phi­
losophers of motion who went away grinding their teeth, recorded the event.
When doubts sprout, the harvest can be bountiful. Iconoclasts have also

60
GALILEO
savaged the story of Galileo's discovery of the (approximate) isochronism
of the pendulum, which, like the experiment on the tower, exploited a piece
of church furniture. This was the lamp that still sways in the Pisa cathedral.
Its testimony is equivocal, however, because Viviani, from whom the story
comes, placed the critical observation-that the period of the swings is inde­
pendent of their amplitude-in Calileo's student days, and so before 1585.
The heavy, costly lamp (almost 600 scudi) dates from 1587. Viviani specified
that Galileo determined the isochronism by counting his heartbeats and tap­
ping out a tune, and that he immediately exploited the effect in a pulse meter,
"to the amazement and delight of the doctors of the time."!" The pulse meter,
or pusilogium, a sort of metronome, made its first appearance in print in 1602,
in a book by a Venetian doctor, Santorio Santorio. Previously physicians had
distinguished only 49 different sorts of pulses. With Santone's compound­
ing of exact pulse rates and imprecise humors, however, they had 80,084,
improving the practice of medicine by 160,000 percent.'?" No more than the
peevish peripatetics, however, did the delighted doctors of Pisa, if there were
any, leave a record of their debt to Galileo.
Owing to the discrepancies in Viviani's account of his master's adventures
with the tower and the lamp, historians take care when he is the only wit­
ness. Some have been so bold as to assert that he made things up and that
Galileo experimented only in his head.!'? This was to go too far and, in recent
times, Galileo has become an exemplary, pioneering experimentalist.'!' One
thing for certain can be said about Viviani's stories. Had Galileo stood on
the Leaning Tower throwing down weights and gauntlets before the assem­
bled university, he would have had to wear his toga. The authorities insisted
that professors don their academic gowns when in the town as well as when
discharging their university duties, on pain of the substantial fine of half a
scudo. Galileo so hated this imposition that he wrote a lengthy and irrever­
ent poem against it. The poem tells something about his pursuits and attain­
ments at the age of 25. Many sacred cows came to slaughter by his sharp wit:
university officials, ecclesiastics, academics, philosophers, idiots. And many
youthful preoccupations leave their marks: sex, wine, clothes, moncy.I"
Calileo's burlesque follows the style of the critical-satirical digressive
poems of Francesco Berni, who died in Florence long before he could have
regretted seeing his entire oeuvre placed on the Index of Prohibited Books.
This did not prevent their publication, however, and Galileo regarded them
highly for their wit and iconoclasm. Although Galileo's "Capitolo contro il

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
61
portar la toga" has its zing from his annoyance over the rule of the robe and
the stock association of academic dress with pedantry, it was of a piece with
his duller sonnets in that it was an exercise to master a literary form. One
of Berni's favorite techniques was to treat a common subject in an elevated
manner, "in praising [as Galileo characterized the method] the meanest
things, urinals, plague, debt, Aristotle, etc.:"!' Galileo adapted the technique
to his purpose by developing a philosophy of clothes long before Thomas
Carlyle's Professor Teufelsdröckh took it up as something new. Also Galileo
followed Berni by beginning with the Socratic question, what is the greatest
good? Satirists in the Bernesque style enjoyed lampooning the notion of the
summum bonum, and coupling it with nudity and anticlericalism.'!"
Philosophers have disputed the summum bonum for centuries without reso­
lution or imagination, Galileo wrote, because they have not known where or
how to look for it.
The ways of invention are varied, very
To seize on the good there's but one that has worked
Look about for an evident contrary.
That means search out evil, it's easily found
You've then Summum bonum, no trouble at all
Bad and good are as like as pence in a pound.!"
If you would know the sinful, look at the good people to whom priests give
penance; if you are studying scoundrels and rogues, "it is enough to know
priests and friars, who are pure goodness and devotion." In short, to know
the best thing in the world, take the easier course and seek the worst. The
worst thing in the world is-clothes. Clothes are the source of all deceit. In
the good old times, everyone knew what everyone else was good for. A pro­
spective bride could see the equipment of her proposed mate, "See if he is
too small, or has French diseases I Thus informed, take or leave him as she
pleases." Without clothes, the white, black, and brown robes of the monks
would not divide Christians; foremen could not be distinguished from work­
men, or patrons from underlings. When people went naked there were no
counts, marquises, servants, or paupers. The devil invented clothes as he
devised artillery and witches-to the devil with clothes!
If it is God's will, however, Galileo will wear his toga, as if he were a
pharisee or a rabbi, "though I am not the least Jewish, even if my name and
descent might suggest it." This is a reference to the men of Galilee who stared

GALILEO
into Heaven as Christ ascended, not a disclosure that Galileo, like Newton
and Aristotle, were Jews. No doubt it is anti-Semitic. Like a rabbi's robe, the
academic gown is a cloak for all sorts of skullduggery. Since its wearers feel
conspicuous entering a whorehouse, they relieve themselves in other ways
more prejudicial to their salvation. To attract less attention and avoid the uni­
versity's proctor (Cappone Capponi), berobed doctors creep around town
on all fours (carpon carpone).1l6 The toga holds up anyone in a hurry just like
(Galileo missed this image) Ruggiero encumbered by his armor.
At work the good doctor is equally ridiculous:
Why in the world does he not die of shame
When standing surrounded by eighteen or more
Bright open-mouthed students awe-struck by his fame
Looking to all as he parades out beforc'm
Like a screech owl among so many robins.
All the screech owls are not equal. Those in velvet gowns are esteemed more
highly than those who can afford only worsted. Oh, sighs Galileo, if only
men were made like the wine flasks used in taverns, which have so little dec­
oration you can see right through them:
And yet they are filled with such excellent wine
It's not surprising if throughout the city
They say that it's splendid and even divine.
Bottles, however, straw-covered and pretty
When opened you'll find to be chock full of sin
Wine slimy or wat'ry, perfumed or gritty,
In dec'rative flasks good only to piss in.
Galilee's exercise in the Bernesque manner did not raise his standing at the
university. An old professor of medicine, who had joined the faculty at Pisa
after many years at Padua, Girolamo Mercuriale, urged him to leave. He
should apply for the Paduan chair of mathematics vacant since the death of
its admired incumbent Giuseppe Moletti in 1588. Mercuriale had been close
to Moletti and to Moletti's friend Giovanni Vincenzo Pinelli, whose library
was the cultural heart of Padua. Knowing the territory, Mercuriale also knew,
as he wrote Galileo, "the University of Padua is the proper place for your
genius." And it paid better. Mercuriale could alert Pinelli and the Venetian

A TUSCAN ARCHIMEDES
overseers of the university to the treasure they might import from Tuscany.'!"
The del Monte brothers, always faithful patrons of Galileo, added their rec­
ommendations and the hope that Padua would put Galileo in the limelight,
"for to say the truth you are known to very few." In September 1592 Galileo
paid a successful visit to Venice. The overseers offered him a salary of 180
scudi, three times his Pisan pittance, to replace Moletti. He accepted subject
to his obtaining permission from Ferdinando to leave Tuscany. Release was
not automatic. Ferdinando's predecessor Francesco had not allowed Gali­
leo's patron Strozzi to leave Florence to serve a Polish prince, presumably
because he did not care to lose so valuable a man. Ferdinando had no reason
to stand in Calileo's way. There is no record that the university intervened to
keep him. A young man with the effrontery to write against his robe of office
could be dispensed with.!" Galileo left Pisa in the fall of 1592 for what he later
rated as the best eighteen years of his life."?

3
Life in the Serenissima
Galileo spent his first eight years at Padua settling in and setting up, forming
important friendships, and living relatively carefree. He kept up his wide
interests, learned how to dissimulate, and did nothing significant in science.
Around 1600 he burdened himself with debt, began a family, rented a large
house, and started a private academy and instrument business. During this
second phase, he became subject to a recurrent illness accompanied by a
fever that could send him to bed for weeks. These bouts and his many com­
mitments when in good health depleted the time he had to devote to subjects
beyond his statutory teaching. Still, with the help of friends, he managed to
bring his study of motion to maturity and to develop some ideas about the
world system, although nothing important went into print.
3.1 SETTLING IN
A fight for souls
When Galileo gave his inaugural lecture in December 1592, the big man on
campus, some fourteen years his senior, was Cesare Cremonini (Plate 7),
the junior professor of philosophy. Cremonini had arrived at the university
only a year earlier, trailing a reputation as teacher, stylist, writer, and phi­
losopher. He came from the University of Ferrara, where he was an intimate
of the duke and a friend of Tasso; he wrote plays and poems, understood
mathematics, and could practice medicine.' His inaugural lecture at Padua
suggests the feelings of a professor newly called from the provinces and the
eloquence that quickly made Cremonini a spokesman for the faculty. The
theme was hackneyed, the treatment clever.

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
Each of us is a microcosm of the universe, said the new professor; hence
introspection can deliver knowledge of the world as well as of the self;
he who knows himself is a natural philosopher! God is a philosopher, the
most dedicated of philosophers, as his existence consists entirely in self­
contemplation. "You, fortunate youth, have come to the best place to learn
to know yourself." The glory that was Athens lives again at the University
of Padua through the generosity and perspicacity of the patricians who run
and ran the Most Serene Republic of Venice. At great expense and effort they
have gathered here the greatest professors from all over Italy, and even from
abroad, "to the advantage of all of Europe.'? Cremonini was one of the great
ones, full of his subject, popular with his students, and withering about his
colleagues. One of his comedies against a fellow professor hits the level of
Calileo's satire on the Pisan toga.' Cremonini was the sort of man Galileo
delighted to cultivate: thorough scholar, expert logician, ready wit, bon
vivant.
The glorious "Bà"-the university's nickname after an inn with the sign
of an ox that once occupied its site-was not the only center of learning in
Padua. The Jesuit College there had been teaching grammar gratis for over
forty years to boys from patrician families when in the 1580s it decided to
open its higher courses to the public. Patricians who wanted their heirs
taught morals as well as mathematics, and for free, preferred it to the univer­
sity, where youth risked its soul while learning about it from Cremonini, and
at a cost of over 100 scudi a year. In the summer of 1591 some bovisti thought
to defeat the gesuiti by invading a lecture at the Jesuit College and stripping
themselves to the naked truth. The Jesuits complained through channels­
the Rettori stationed in Padua to oversee conduct at the university and the
Riformatori, or general supervisors of education, headquartered in Venice.
The strippers received suitable punishment and the Jesuits continued their
competition in the false security that the authorities supported them. They
reckoned without Cremonini. The arts faculty designated its new philoso­
pher to represent it before the chief executives of the Venetian state, the Doge
and the Senate."
The speech Cremonini delivered in December 1591 reverberated throughout
Europe. In contrast to his inaugural address, Cremonini now represented the
university as declining owing to the operation of a Gresham's law whereby
cheap rote learning drives out precious free inquiry. Already Jesuit competi­
tion had destroyed the grammar schools of Padua; the same would happen

66
GALILEO
to the university, as it did to the Sapienza at Rome, unless the Senate acted. It
is your affair, Cremonini said, switching the burden from school to state: do
you want to permit a foreign prince (the pope) to set up an alternative uni­
versity whose shoddy attractions will draw students from your own?' That
stung the Senate into action. By the end of the year it had closed the offending
courses in the College. The Jesuits in their turn recognized a grave threat to
their corporate interests. A long struggle ensued, which lasted until the expul­
sion of the order from Venetian territory in 1606.6 The tempest made difficult
sailing for Galileo, who wanted to retain good relations with his pro-Jesuit
patrons and Jesuit mathematicians and also with his anti-Jesuit patrons and
Cremonini's supporters. Navigation required dissimulation. Galileo could not
have asked for a better mentor in masquerade than Cremonini. "Think as you
please [he liked to say], but behave as expected."
The senior Jesuit in the contretemps, and perhaps its instigator, was a man
worth knowing, Antonio Possevino, an exemplar of the cultured and obedi­
ent, active and passive, generous and ruthless Counter Reformation Jesuit
that Galileo could never understand.ê Possevino had retired to Padua in 1587
after a distinguished career opening and nurturing Jesuit colleges in North­
ern and Eastern Europe in order to finish an immense Bibliotheca selecta of
readings suitable for Jesuit savants. In its three editions (1593, 1603, 1607) and
many bowdlerizations, the Bibliotheca selecta improved on the Index of Pro­
hibited Books by censoring such minutiae as printers' devices and rubricated
letters. It did not anticipate the condemnation of Copernicus' treatment of
astronomy, however, and recommended it in all three versions. Vincenzo
Calilei's books figure in its section on music." Seldom, however, do such
free thinkers find a place on Possevino's reading list." To him "liberty" was
"license." God's will and order, he shouted, and Mosaic and natural law, con­
demn freedom of thought as the fountainhead of heresy and atheism." "Oh
ignoble and miserable study of philosophy, if by it men are made learned to
defend impious ideas and to disdain theology, the mother of the truest doc­
trines and the true guide to right thinking and living! "12 A good example of
the worst possible sort of philosopher is Averroes, "whom some demented
[commentators] make equal to Aristotle and superior to Saint Thomas,"
though he is absurd, idiotic, and pernicious. Nonetheless, Possevino recom­
mended Averroes' champion Borro, which suggests that, like lesser compil­
ers, he did not look at all the books he cited."

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
Possevino took fright at the slightest hint of indecency. He recommended
that the classical poets be read only in controlled excerpts; fig-leaf ellipses
only excite unseemly curiosity. There would have been little left of Ariosto.
Nudity drove him crazy, hence, perhaps, the bovisti striptease. He held that
the reappearance of nudity in art ("the monstrous images of naked women")
were the work of the devil in revenge for the evangelization of the New
World.14 "Whoever retains any honesty in his heart hardly dares to look at
himself undressed." The man had a problem, exacerbated, perhaps, by seeing
a book of erotic and anticlerical poems he had edited for a patron placed on
the Index."
Still-we are still with Possevino-just as it was licit for Judith to trick
herself out after certain prophylactic measures in order to lure Holofernes
to his doom, "so eloquence and the sciences brought by clerics to the rock
and citadel of God become shields and weapons to drive away attackers
of God's church."? Paintings if decorous and historically accurate educate
the faithful; architecture builds sound and inspiring churches and colleges;
mathematics underpins music and calculations of Easter," In the politics of
his order Possevino was liberal enough to get into trouble. He opposed the
rigidification that took place under the Jesuit General Acquaviva. He fought,
to the injury of his reputation, a new rule forbidding converted Jews from
entering the order, and he once acknowledged, again to his detriment, that
the Venetians were not entirely in the wrong in the events that led to the
expulsion of 1606.18
Among Possevino's close friends was Pinelli, the patrician who had urged
Galileo's call to Padua and coached him through the hiring process. Since
during the first months of his tenure Galileo lived with Pinelli, he had many
opportunities to meet his host's conservative friends," for example, Monsig­
nore Paolo Gualdo, perhaps the strongest supporter of the Jesuits in Padua.
One of Gualdo's brothers was a Jesuit, the favorite disciple, it is said, of the
order's chief theologian Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (Plate 7), and Gualdo
almost became one himself. Galileo liked Gualdo's combination of deep
religiosity with a taste for banter and a cultivated interest in the arts. Gual­
do's partiality to Tasso, whom he knew personally, gave them lots to banter
about. Gualdo and Galileo became good friends." Galileo had no desire, and
at first feit no need, to ally himself with either the pro- or anti-Jesuit camp.
Eventually, however, he would have to choose.

68
GALILEO
Pinelli had mastered the art of smoothing over differences among
savants. His magnificent library, the meeting place of the best-filled and
most interesting minds in Padua and Venice, held not only the books
recommended by Possevino, but also a quantity of Catholic criticism of
the Tridentine spirit, books by heretics, and items prohibited by the Con­
gregation of the Index. Conversation took place in Pinelli's plentiful and
peaceful library under the banner of Patavina libertas, or local academic
freedom. The names of some of the regulars may be gathered from the
Liber amicorum kept by its sometime librarian, Thomas Segeth. II This
Book of Friends, compiled around 1599, includes the signatures of Pos­
sevino and Galileo and of several other people who will figure later in
this story: Jacques Badouère (Giacomo Badovere), a French Protestant
student of Calileo's who became a Catholic and possibly a Jesuit; Marino
Ghetaldi, a mathematician from Ragusa; Lorenzo Pignoria, Paduan priest
and precocious archeologist; Monsignore Antonio Querenghi, Paduan
patrician, priest, and patron; and the redoubtable anti-Jesuit polymathic
monk Paolo Sarpi." Segeth's bookful of academic friends did not save him
from a jail sentence for defaming more solid citizens. Eventually he was
expelled from Venetian territory. He made his way to Prague and Kepler,
where we will run into him again."
Teaching at the Bà
Pinelli's library included Moletti's books and manuscripts, which Galileo
studied while composing his inaugural lecture, delivered to great applause
in December 1592.24 Its text has not survived, but encomiums of it have,
from Giacomo Contarini, a Venetian patron of the arts and sciences, then
soon to become superintendent of the Venetian Arsenal, and a foreign visi­
tor, a student of Tycho Brahe's." The lecture opened a course on a subject
not specified. For the following years, Galileo taught set books in a regular
sequence: 1594/5, Euclid and the Sphere, as at Pisa; 1595/6, Ptolemy's Almagest
(advanced astronomy); 1597/8, Euclid again and the mechanics ascribed to
Aristotle; 1599/1600, Euclid and the Sphere. Again as at Pisa, many of Gali­
leo's students came to him to learn the astrology they would need to practice
medicine. Galileo also cast horoscopes, some for money, but probably not as
cynical calculations."

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
The policy of teaching set books is a reminder that the purpose of the
early modern university was the dissemination, not the creation, of knowl­
edge. The proper approach to any field was to consult the masters. If you
want to learn philosophy, Moletti had advised, go to Aristotle; medicine, to
Galen; geometry, to Euclid; astronomy, to Ptolemy and his school.
After you have mastered the way, for a pastime you can see what others
have said, if you enjoy leisure or have to dispute or lecture publicly;
but not if you teach privately, since then you should just impress on
the minds of your students the sound principles of the arts and sci­
ences you teach. Avoid at all costs filling their heads with meaningless
questions or diverse opinions ... Students [who] have learned nothing
systematically dispute ... like parrots who speak without knowing what
they say."
The statutes of the university for 1607 put the matter more concisely: "All
doctors under penalty of losing their lectureships are obliged to and must
read and explain clearly and demonstrate the authors they are obliged to
teach, de verbo ad verbum, word for word.'?"
The system had the advantage that everyone who went through it knew
or was supposed to know the same things. And it survives, in the best
places, for example, in university courses on Newtonian mechanics and
wave optics. The neophyte cannot be exposed to all the arcana at once. The
system involves a species of double truth, one for the classroom and one for
the laboratory or, in the case of Galileo's colleagues, private conversation
or unpublished manuscripts. Double truth can lead to surprising places. By
sticking strictly to the regulations, Cremonini gained the reputation of hold­
ing the belief, which he taught from Aristotle's De anima, that the individual
soul dies with the body." Thus his classroom truth. Outside the classroom,
however, the truth of the Church held sway and the soul became immortal.
Which truth trumps? Which did Cremonini hold? No one knows. The Jes­
uits, the Inquisition, and French libertines in search of father figures judged
Cremonini a heretic for believing as well as teaching that the soul is mortal,
the world eternal, God indifferent, and other Greek aberrations; and they
adduced his apocryphal epitaph, Caesar Cremoninus hie totus jacet, in confirma­
rion." But these admirers did not have access to his manuscripts, in some of
which he strove to prove immortality by the pure light of reason." Prying

70
GAll LEO
modern scholars accept his defense against accusations of unbelief (that he
delivered only Aristotle's opinions), which, however, he undercut by refus­
ing to rebut his bad pagan texts with good Christian arguments in his books,
which were not subject to the statute on teaching. But, did he believe these
Greek things? As a good Christian, he said, "it has been and is my intention
to ... follow the teaching of the doctors and particularly of Saint Thomas."32
And as a good philosopher? It is hard to unmask Cremonini." What is clear
is the counterintuitive proposition that for Cremonini, as for Borro and
Buonamici, towing the line was an expression of academic freedom."
Galileo also had a truth for the classroom and another for his manuscripts.
The discrepancy did not become public during his tenure at Padua, however,
partly because he was not entirely certain of the private truth (the Copernican
system) and partly because the relevant public truth (the Ptolemaic system)
was generally accepted outside the classroom. An indication of the content of
Galileo's public courses, for which neither syllabus nor notes have survived,
may be inferred from the texts he prepared for sale to his private students on
the same subjects. These concern the sphere and simple machines. The first
has the interest that it remains at the level of a thirteenth-century primer, the
Sphaera of John of Sacrobosco, the second that it builds on sixteenth-century
updates of the Mechanica then ascribed to Aristotle. Galileo never took own­
ership of the cosmological "hypotheses" underpinning his Sphaera whereas
he claimed priority in the formulation of the pseudo-Aristotelian principle
on which he developed his account of simple machines.
The world according to Sacrobosco consists of the familiar four-element
sublunary kernel surrounded by layered heavens of quintessence bounded
by a star-studded spherical shell. There are seven layers counting outward
from the stationary central earth, one each for the sun, moon, and planets,
arranged in the order of their apparent speeds: Saturn, which moves most
slowly against the stars, occupies the seventh sphere; then come Jupiter,
Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and, in the first heaven, our moon. Why is
the cosmos built like an onion? Interpreting Sacrobosco, Galileo responded
as would a modern physicist reduced to fundamentals: symmetry! Why
should the universe extend more to the east, or upward or downward, than
in any other direction? But we need not speculate. We see the stars go in
circles, the earth's circular shadow on the moon, the tops of towers visible
from sea before their bottoms, and so on, all Aristotelian arguments for
the onion universe; to which Galileo added the characteristic argument,

complete with the only figure in his text, that Archimedes required the
surface of free-standing water, like our ocean, to lie on a sphere centered
on the world's umbilicus."
How do we know that the earth's center coincides with this umbilicus?
Among several reasons Galileo offers a "very beautiful observation taken
from lunar eclipses." During these extinctions, the earth lies between the
sun and the moon. The line joining them can point in any direction, like the
diameter of a circle, "wherefore, since ... diverse diameters have nothing in
common but the center, nor is there another point than the center in common
to the diameters, the earth is located at the center."36 What did Galileo say to
the smart student who observed that the same argument applied to a solar
eclipse would put the moon at the center? That is not recorded. He did take
the trouble to set right those "very great philosophers and mathematicians"
like Copernicus who put the earth in motion. No such motion is possible.
The earth can not move rectilinearly by nature, since by nature it has to go
to the center (a fine petitio principii, with which Galileo later taxed peripatet­
ics); nor can it spin in place, for if it did birds would be left behind, buildings
would collapse, objects would not fall vertically. Had not Moletti said that
the Copernican picture is "a chimera of all chimeras the most chimerical?":"
To clinch his argument, Galileo observed that a rock let go from the top of a
mast of a moving ship hits the deck in the stern." A very pliable demonstra­
tion, as we shall see!
After putting the earth to rest Galileo left subjects that belonged to natural
philosophy to deliver the useful material he was supposed to teach: definitions
of the circles on the sphere (equator, ecliptic, horizon, meridian), coordinates
(celestial latitude and longitude), climes (strips between latitudes whose long­
est days differ by half and hour), causes of eclipses, and, his most advanced
topics, the precession of the equinoxes." Though useful as orientation, Gali­
leo's Sphere was to state-of-the-art astronomy of his time what physics for
poets is to string theory in ours. Accurate predictions of the positions of the
planets required mathematical machinery that translated two capital facts
unknown in 1600 into geocentric terms: each planet travels in an ellipse con­
taining the sun at a focus; the speed of travel varies so that the line connecting
sun and planet sweeps out equal segments of the ellipse in equal times. This
clumsy statement, which contains discoveries that Kepler announced in 1609,
may be clear from Figure 3.1, where the orbit TIPl2 ... A centered at C con­
tains the sun at the focus S (the other focus X is unoccupied). Kepler's "area

law" requires that the planet move on its orbit with varying speed such that,
if the areas nsP1, P1SP2 ••• PsSA are equal, then the planet takes equal intervals
of time to move through the arcs np1, Pl2 ••• PsA. Since SlI < SA, 81> 86 and
the planet appears to move more quickly (as seen from the sun) around peri­
helion (Il) than around aphelion (A).
Ptolemy delivered in his Almagest the brilliant simple geocentric approx­
imation to Kepler motion shown in Figure 3.2. We have the same line of
apsides AXeSn, but the orbit is now a circle and the planet's motion is
regulated by the "equant" point X, around which the line PX revolves with
constant angular velocity (angle a increases by equal amounts in equa1
times). Motion on an "eccentric" circle (one not centered on the sun S)
regulated by an equant is, for a small "eccentricity" f: (e = es I en), indis­
tinguishable from motion in a Kepler ellipse with the same eccentric­
ity and line of absides. The consequence is that 8 behaves in almost the
same way in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. Ptolemy incorporated the model of Figure
3.2 into his geocentric system by placing the earth E at S and taking the
earth's motion into account by making the planet P rotate around a sec­
ondary circle or "epicycle" while the epicycle's center Q rotates around
the equant X in the eccentric circle e (Figure 3-3). Galileo had to teach this
eccentric stuff in his statutory courses on Ptolemy. He then did his best
to forget about it. There are no eccentrics or equants in his later polem­
ics in favor of the sun-centered system. Nor, in his later work, is there an
acknowledgment that Kepler motion in a Kepler ellipse is a substantial
technical improvement over equant motion in an eccentric circle. It is a
great tribute to Galileo's rhetorical skill that he managed to maintain a

debate on the foundations of astronomy at the undergraduate technical
level of Sacrobosco's sphere.
Galileo's treatment of simple machines involved no double truths. He
stood behind his version of medieval and ancient mechanics as then recently
reconstructed by Benedetti, del Monte, and Moletti. Two of their works, del
Monte's Le mecchaniche (1577, 1581), and Moletti's incomplete and unpublished
Dialogue on mechanics (1576), offer instructive comparisons with Galileo's
treatment. (A few points in Benedetti's Speculations (1585) are also relevant,
but as they occur unsystematically, in corrections of Aristotelian assertions,

they were not a ready model for Galileo.) Del Monte, Moletti, and Galileo
all rely on the pseudo-Aristotelian principle that power to move is propor­
tional to the velocity of the mover. Moletti makes clear the principle, and
uses it to derive the law of the balance, by appealing to the wheel-and-axle
of Figure 304. Since in lifting the weight W through a distance equal to the arc
AB the power P must move through a distance equal to the arc CD, velocity
of P: velocity of W = arc CD: arc AB = CO: AO. That is just geometry. Now
invoke pseudo-Aristotle's fundamental principle, according to which the
system is in equilibrium if the velocities are inversely as the weights. Since
the velocities also vary directly as the distances, the weights are inversely
as the distances: W: P = CO: AO. Behold, Archimedes law of static balance
derived from dynamical considerations." As pseudo-Aristotle remarked, the
circle is made of contraries (it is both convex and concave, and when spin­
ning moves simultaneously in opposite directions), "[so that] there is noth­
ing strange in the circle being the origin of any and every marvel." There was
something bothersome, however, about obtaining a rule for static equilib­
rium from reasoning about potential displacements."
Moletti claimed jurisdiction over simple machinery, hydraulic engi­
neering, and military technology, and all devices enabling a small force to
move a greater. Since every such trick appears somehow to defraud nature,
Moletti supposed that the word "machine" derived from "machination."
Galileo would be very severe against this way of expressing the productive

wheel and axle, by which the
lesser power P raises the greater
weight W.

exploitation of natural powers. Moletti included the theory de motu within
mechanics and succeeded in persuading himself not only that all objects
irrespective of their size and material fall with the same acceleration, but
also that Aristotelian physics could not be patched up to account for it.
Galileo would take both propositions as fundamental in his revisions of the
ideas on motion he had developed in Pisa."
Galileo employed the pseudo-Aristotelian principle of velocities to move
in the direction opposite to Moletti, from static equilibrium to dynamical
effect. Observing that the slightest additional weight on either side will tip
a balance, he proposed to ignore the increment altogether and to set the
moving force equal to the equilibrated weight. It followed immediately that
the wheel-and-axle in action (without acceleration!) satisfies the relation
OC'P = OA·W. Now, whereas Moletti emphasized P's greater velocity, Gali­
leo emphasized W's greater sluggishness. In effect, P has to raise the weight
W IP P times. Mechanicians had failed to realize (according to Galileo) that
their art allows them only to divide up weights virtually and work on them
piecemeal. The claim that machines can overcome a large resistance by
a small force is not only wrong but fraudulent." A small force moving
a larger weight via a machine must either act over a greater distance or
over a longer time than a force big enough to move the weight directly. No
machine can outwit nature." From this consideration Galileo deduced an
explanation for the need for motion in percussion, which he claimed as his
own, and the first satisfactory one ever given. The product of the weight
of a battering ram and its velocity equals the product of the resistance of
the object struck and its velocity. "For things to be otherwise would not
only be absurd, but impossible." He would return to this subject in his final
contribution to physics."
Like Moletti, del Monte based the theory of simple machines on the principle
"learned ... from Aristotle, that all mechanical problems and all mechanical
theorems are reducible to the [lever and hence the] wheel." In implement­
ing this insight, del Monte followed Archimedes, on whose legendary feats
he expatiated, and his own teacher Commandino, "[whose] commentaries
smell of Archimedes' own lamp."" Thus inspired, del Monte expended fifty
pages investigating the consequences of dropping the unphysical restriction,
adopted by Archimedes and Galileo, to weightless balance arms." del Monte
also made news with his analysis of the pulley and its amplification into the
block-and-tackle by showing how to reduce them to a lever. In Figure 3.5,

the upper pulley is fixed at F and each of the ropes AC, GD supports half of
W if we neglect, as del Monte allowed himself to do, the weights of the ropes
and pulleys. He remarked that D may be regarded as fixed (instantaneously)
and thus as the fulcrum of the lever CD with force P at C and load W at R.
Hence CD·P = DR·W = CD·Wj2, or P = Wj2: the system allows a force to move
twice its effective weight. A third pulley (Figure 3.6) provides a mechanical
advantage of 3 or 4 depending on whether it is attached to the top or bottom
block. Perhaps of greatest importance for Galileo, del Monte showed that
the power must move through a distance (WjP)s if the weight is to be lifted
through a height S.48
Galileo shortened and simplified del Monte's tour de force on pulleys (as
did Benedetti) by distinguishing the cases of even and odd numbers of pul­
leys and generalizing each by appeal to the law of the lever." He followed
del Monte closely on the wheel-and-axle, wedge, and screw, showing how
all of them too can be reduced to the lever. Galileo took a step beyond
his model in a short, clear account of that most "marvelous ... miracu­
lous" instrument, the Archimedean screw, a hollow cylinder with blades
mounted screw-like on its concave wall (Figure 3.7). The operator dips
the screw into a river or well at a convenient inclination, and, by contin­
ually turning a crank or gear, lifts water in a continuous flow from the
top of the cylinder." In sum, Calileo's Mechanics outdid its likely sources

in simplicity, clarity, and coherence. 51 He decided against publishing it for
two complementary reasons. There was nothing remarkable enough to
make his reputation but enough to make some money when sold in hand­
written copies to his students.
Visits to Venice
when Galileo entered its service in 1592, the maritime Republic of Venice
was having a hard time on the high seas. Despite the victory of the Holy
League, in which Venice acted with Spain and the Holy See, over the Turk­
ish fleet at Lepanto in 1571, the Eastern Mediterranean remained a dangerous
place. Turkish pirates and their Dutch and English colleagues took increas­
ing numbers of Venetian merchantmen. Attempting to mitigate the threat, at
least in the Adriatic, the Venetians redesigned their great warships for more
speed and maneuverability. Until the battle of Lepanto, Venetian triremes
sat three men to a bench, each with his own oar. That suited a regime in
which most of the labor was neither convict nor slave. After Lepanto, Ven­
ice adopted the practice of other navies, used convict labor, and chained as
many as eight men to work a single oar. The system reduced the effects of
variations among individuals and suggested the treatment of octets of oars­
men as a complex cog in a great machine." Officials at the state arsenal,
which made all Venetian warships, wanted to know whether any changes in
the length, shape, and support of the oars, and the situation and technique
of the rowers, would improve the cog's efficiency.
In 1593, Contarini, newly installed at the Arsenal, asked Galileo how
Archimedes would have placed the gangs and their oars." Did it matter
where the oarlock was placed? Galileo answered no, since the oar acts like
a lever and only the ratio of the distances of the forces from the fulcrum
count. Contarini must have felt himself lucky to have such a mathematician
to hand, for Galileo, on his own accounting, was perhaps the first person to
understand the mechanism of rowing. The stan-dard explanation, given in the
Aristotelian Mechanica, made the sea the resistance, the rower the force, and
the oarlock the fulcrum." In Galileo's version, the ship, acting at the lock, is
the resistance and the water, when the oar first attacks it, the fulcrum. Con­
tarini replied that there was much more to consider: the height of the rowing
bank, the length and counterweight of the oar, the principle that the loom
occupied a third of the length of the oar, and the difference in power required

at different distances along the loom. Perhaps Galileo tried to take these fac­
tors into account. Probably he learned that lengthening galley oars would
not work because if made usefully longer they would break unless thickened
so much rowers could not move them. The scaling problem again!" Galileo
visited the Arsenal to see the galleys under construction. The operations in
the öo-acre plant, which could employ 3,000 men and turn out 50 ships a
month, made an enduring impression on him."
While thus mechanically challenged, Galileo applied for a patent on a
horse-driven pump to raise a continuous stream of water for irrigation. He
obtained a monopoly for 20 years. One such pump was installed in the gar­
dens of the Contarinis. From the same time, 1593/4, date two practical trea­
tises on military architecture, which although derivative in content testify to
Calileo's concern to furnish his new patrons with the practical advice they
expected from a mathematician worthy of his keep." Galileo continued to
have business with the Contarinis through their agent in Padua, who bought
wine from Galileo, served as godfather to his daughters, and, perhaps, helped
to draw up the marriage contract of Calileo's sister Livia."
Galileo soon found places of resort in Venice more amusing than the
Arsenal. One was the palace of the Morosini brothers, Andrea (later an offi­
cial historian of Venice) and his brother Niccolo, on the Grand Canal near
San Luca. The Morosini ran a salon whose roster outdid that of Pinelli's
famous library in Padua. Future doges, cultured patricians, university pro­
fessors, some 20 or 30 strong, came together to talk freely about most sub­
jeers." They talked very freely about politics. The Morosini circle included
the leaders of the party then largely in control of the state, notably the future
doges Leonardo Donà and Niccolo Contarini. These giovani, as they called
themselves, centered their policies on hostility to Rome, Spain, and the
Jesuits, and on promotion of good relations with states beyond the penin­
sula, particularly France. Their idea of Catholicism harked back to Erasmus,
flirted with Protestantism, and opposed the Tridentine spirit." Although the
Morosini set were powerful, they did not always prevail when it counted.
One of the regulars before Galileo's arrival was the notorious Giordano
Bruno, whose dogmatic heresies often built on or incorporated Copernican
ideas and other modern notions. Although these notions were not judged
heretical in themselves, anyone who urged them could be suspected of guilt
by association, and the horror of Bruno's death at the stake in Rome in 1600
recommended caution to innovators. The lesson was the stronger to those

80
GALILEO
who knew that several members of the influential Morosini circle including
Donà fought Bruno's extradition to Rome but without enough firepower to
defeat the Inquisition."
Another Morosini regular, the Servite Sarpi (Plate 8), would present the
Vatican with a graver threat than Bruno." An anecdote related by Sarpi's
fellow Servite, disciple, and biographer, Fulgenzio Micanzio, who became
a loyal friend to Galileo, suggests Sarpi's redoubtable reputation. One day,
when Pinelli was laid up with the gout, Fra Paolo came to call. In great
pain Pinelli staggered out to meet his guest. His behavior dumfounded
another visitor, the mathematician Marino Ghetaldi. "Why go to all that
trouble for a monk?" Pinelli: "He is the wonder of the age." Ghetaldi asked
in what field Sarpi excelled. "In whatever field you please." Pinelli sug­
gested that Ghetaldi think up a hard problem and spring it on Sarpi at
dinner. Ghetaldi was able and erudite, a former student of Clavius, Coig­
net, and the algebraist Viète; he had a cornucopia of up-to-date problems
from which to draw a tough nut. Fra Paolo had no trouble cracking it.
Galileo later said of Sarpi that "no one in Europe comes before him in
knowledge of the [mathematical] sciences.'?" He was to serve Galileo as
guidepost and sounding board, and, very probably, as role model. Sev­
eral ideas akin to Galilee's innovations in physics appear in Sarpi's private
notebooks. Sarpi's cultivation of algebra, however, did not awaken a cor­
responding interest in Galileo.?'
Although Galileo did not acknowledge whatever he may have taken from
Sarpi, others were not so reticent. The famous Paduan anatomist Fabricius
of Acquapendente, writing on the accommodation of the eye, acknowledged
that Sarpi, "[a master of] all the mathematical disciplines, especially optics,"
had pointed out the mechanism to him. Fabricius' discovery of the valves of
veins likewise owed something to Sarpi's shrewd observations. Giambattista
della Porta, the Neapolitan playwright and natural magician, considered
Sarpi an authority on magnetism and on almost everything else. "I not only
confess, that I gained something, but I glory in it, because of all the men I
ever saw, I never knew any man more learned, or more ingenious, having
obtained the whole body of knowledge; and is not only the Splendour and
Ornament of Venice or Italy, but of the whole world.'?"
Sarpi was a man of the world as well as its ornament. He had been
to Rome, to represent his order at the Vatican and had come to know at
first hand the most rigid expressions of the Counter Reformation and the

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
81
Tridentine spirit, and the most extravagant papal claims to primacy over
princes. So extravagant were these claims as put forward under Sixtus V
(1585-90), that the pope almost disciplined the Jesuit disciplinarian Bel­
larmine, a future cardinal inquisitor and now a saint, for the laxness of his
views about papal prerogative. In view of Bellarmine's later relations with
Sarpi, with whom he was on friendly terms in Rome, and with Galileo,
his comment on Sixtus' high-handed policy is high irony: "this is the sort
of thing that cost us Germany and one day will cause us to risk losing
Italy." Sarpi improved his time around the Vatican by studying Copernicus
and della Porta before returning to Venice in 1588 to continue his efforts to
reform the Servites. His brethren showed their appreciation by denounc­
ing him several times to the Holy Office for a mixture of silly and serious
charges: wearing the wrong cut of clerical clothes, omitting to say a certain
prayer, but also frequenting Jews and Frenchmen, and harboring Protes­
tant and even atheistic sympathies."
Around 1600 Sarpi tried to obtain a quiet bishopric as a refuge for study.
Pope Clement VIII, whom he had impressed, inclined to grant the request.
But Possevino, who was on the spot and supersensitive to the least whiff of
Calvinism, convinced Clement to deny it. The advice was good in so far as a
post-Trent bishop had more to do than cultivate his mind and disseminate
doubt; but it was also bad, as it completed Sarpi's transformation into an
enemy of Rome of Lutheran intensity and pertinacity." While he awaited
his opportunity, he took daily doses of what he called "moral medicine," or
applied hypocrisy. As political science, moral medicine taught that religion
is to the body politic what medicine is to the body human: just as a good
doctor sometimes deceives his patients to restore health, so the statesman
and priest tell tall stories like eternal damnation to secure a peaceful society.
As epistemology, moral medicine taught that all knowledge is relative. Prefer
the useful or the pleasurable; to every argument there is an objection; respect
the foolish views of others for you may come to believe them yourself. As a
guide to life, moral medicine recommended disguise. "I have to wear a mask
[Sarpi said] because without one no man can live in Italy.?" Behind his mask,
according to his alter ego Micanzio, Sarpi was a composite of the best of
Greece: Epicurean, Stoic, Cynic, and Socratic. "The disease of mankind [so
fra Paolo liked to say] is the affectation of knowledge."?"
Galileo's closest Venetian friend, also a member of the Morosini set, was
the nobleman immortalized as the independent-minded host in Calileo's

GALILEO
most important dialogues. This was Gianfrancesco Sagredo, seven years
Galileo's junior, an irreverent, endlessly curious man who studied with Gali­
leo in 1597/8. The two became almost like brothers." A self-portrait, drawn
up by Sagredo in 1614, delineates some of the qualities that Galileo admired
and perhaps envied in him (Plate 8):
I am a Venetian gentleman. I never call myself a man of letters. I have
an affection for letterati and protect them, but I do not intend to advance
my fortunes, or earn praise or reputation from knowing something
about philosophy and mathematics. Rather, I rest on the integrity and
good administration of my offices in the governance of the Republic,
to which I applied myself in my youth following the practice of my
elders ... My studies turn toward the recognition of those things that as
a Christian lowe to God, as a citizen to my country, as a patrician to
my house, as a social being to my friends, and, as a gentleman and true
philosopher, to myself. I spend my time serving God and my country,
and, since I am free from family cares, consume a good part of my life
in conversation, service, and satisfaction of friends, and all the rest I
devote to my own taste and convenience; and if sometimes I specu­
late about science, I do not presume to compete with the professors let
alone criticize them, but only to refresh my mind by searching freely,
without any obligation or attachment, the truth of any proposition that
appeals to me."
Among the indulgences that Sagredo permitted himselfwere Jesuit baiting, art
collecting, and womanizing. His best baiting was a lengthy correspondence
with a Jesuit in which he pretended to be a widow with theological doubts
and an available fortune. His collecting favored "fresh, modern, charming,
natural works that deceive the eye, leaving old, smoky, artificial, melancholy
and eccentric ones to better minds than mine." That makes a nice transition
to his "casino," a private brothel where a Moorish lady chaperoned "another
person, very white, eighteen years old."? Sagredo liked his wine as well as
his women and put his imagination to work on both. For the wine at least
he took only the best, and to insure that he quaffed it in optimal condition
invented a combination wine glass and thermometer." Most of these tid­
bits come from letters written after Galileo left Padua. As Sagredo did not
start his carousing in middle age, however, we may suppose that he and his
brother Galileo sampled the pleasures of Venice together when young men.

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
Galileo too was a connoisseur of wine and drank more than the usual mel­
ancholic scholar of what he called "liquid and light.'?"
Some free thinking
To follow Galileo and Sagredo among the girls of Venice requires a little free
thinking. There are some clues. One of the favorite and famous attractions
of sixteenth-century Venice was its company of courtesans. Women in the
upper levels of the trade, the cortigiane oneste, who catered to the patrician
class and high-level visitors, possessed qualities of mind as well as body. The
better talkers among them charged as much for conversation (so Montaigne
learned to his surprise) "as for the entire business.'?" An honest courtesan
could sing and play the lute, read and write, and, in some well-studied cases,
recite and compose poetry." The best known of them now is Veronica
Franco, whose clients included Henri III of France and many lesser dignitar­
ies; whose published poems had some brief acclaim in the society of learned
men she frequented; and whose romanticized story is now available to all on
DVD.77 We may reasonably place the likes of Sagredo on the demand side of
the business of honest courtesans.
The supply side included girls of good, or, anyway, citizen families like
Veronica's, the source of all venetian professionals. Where they obtained their
learning in a society in which even noble women were poorly educated unless
instructed by a male relative is a mystery. Veronica certainly learned something
from her mother, who taught her prostitution, but for most of the rest she
probably educated herself." Girls circumstanced like Veronica had few attrac­
tive life choices: they could raise a dowry, enter a convent, or go on the streets.
The dowry was the key. The larger it was, the higher the prospective bride
could aim; without one, she could scarcely aim at all." Calileo's career would
be shaped by the inflation in dowries during his young manhood.
Some courtesans saved enough to assemble a dowry and marry themselves
off. Perhaps Veronica's mother was such a capitalist. She had enough to pro­
vide Veronica with a dowry of 100 scudi in cash and goods amounting to at
least that much more with which she could afford to buy a mature doctor for
her teenage daughter. (This was about the same amount as Vincenzo Gali­
lei received at the same time to take on his gentle Giulia.) Veronica's mar­
riage was not a success. Re-entering the world dowerless, she quickly earned
enough at 2 scudi an engagement to be able to draw up a will (at the age of

GALILEO
18!) making her residual legatee a charity that allotted poor girls dowries of
25 scudi." Galileo later made a similar benefaction and so did Sagredo. A few
bequests could not do much, however, against the pressure to sell yourself,
and, if you had anything to sell, the desire of frustrated young patricians to
buy. The state too had an interest in these transactions since they helped
prevent adultery among the upper classes and could be taxed. It was said the
tax take on the trade maintained a dozen galleys."
There were around 200 honest courtesans among perhaps 10,000 prostitutes
in Venice when Galileo came to town. He was single and likely to remain so;
professors, especially in the arts, tended not to marry and, as a citizen of
Florence without magnificent prospects, he was not a catch for a prominent
Venetian family. Eight years later, he was the father of a baby girl, Virginia, the
first of three children by a Venetian woman, Marina Gamba, whom he did not
marry. An unfriendly reference to her in 1604 calls her a prostitute; the bap­
tismal certificates of the second child, Livia, and the third, Vincenzo, style her
"Maddona," a title sometimes given to, or affected by, honest courtesans."
So much is certain. To fill in the blanks, we may imagine that, to keep
Galileo interested for at least seven years (that is, from the conception of Vir­
ginia in 1599 to that ofVincenzo in 1506), Marina possessed not only physical
beauty but also a talent for music and a taste for poetry. Poetical courtesans
tended to favor, and in their writings paraphrase and plagiarize, the Rime of
Petrarca." Franco submitted her poems in this line to the judgment of the
salon kept by her literary advisor, no less a person than the son of a doge,
the poet Domenico Venier." Galileo played a similar role (this is an exercise
in imagination) toward Marina and her attempts at rime. As a conscientious
mentor, he entered into the close study of Petrarca evidenced by his surviv­
ing annotations, which critics date over a period of time beginning in his
early Paduan years." These notes, in contrast to Galileo's comments on Ari­
osto and Tasso, deal mainly with points of meter, rhyme, and language, or
trace standard Petrarchan themes."
Among the themes Galileo marked out, love receives by far the most anno­
tations and exclamations. He flagged every passage mentioning eyes, "eyes that
lead the lover by a gentle way to God." He underlined descriptions of feminine
attractions, hair in particular, particularly of blondes. He hinted at an internal
struggle. "Desire expels love and virtue." "A woman without honor is not a
woman."? In her last will, drawn up in 1570, honest Veronica made a bequest to
a little girl, perhaps an adopted infant, which she left in the care of the "M ... .i,"

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
perhaps the Morosini. 88 As we know, Galileo was on familiar terms with one
branch of the Morosini family. He also had ties to the Veniers, two of whom
belonged to the Morosini circle, and one of whom, Sebastiano, became a good
and useful friend." It is a mere and meaningless coincidence that Veronica's
little beneficiary bore the name Marina and that she would have been around
30 in 1600, just the age of Galileo's Marina in that jubilee year.
There exists a long poem attributed to Galileo about a lovers' quarrel for
which the swain takes the blame. Critics date it to 1599 or perhaps later. The
lovesick poet is not happy with his plight. In one stanza he writes as if he
were an astronomer waylaid by physics:
Heaven raised my face to the stars
And, along with those eternal beauties,
Wheeling in the celestial vault,
Calls me; I do not hear their voices.
Rather, I gaze upon the earth
And only attend to human unworthiness.
A face, a look, a smile,
I have made my stars and my heaven.
It seems to me that my soul
Resides more in certain blonde tresses
Than in what I can name my own.
So in my thoughts and not
In the stars I must wrestle for the truth.
The poor man ends in a standard trope loving his misery:
I covet my torments
When I read in my lady's face
That she desires them.
No martyrdom but mine will satisfy her.?"
The undated sonnets mentioned earlier sound the same themes. Here are
two of them:
While displaying in ancient times
The cruel and impious marks of his madness,
Amid fires and carnage and brutal massacres,
The unjust emperor declares:

86
GALILEO
"My reign heavy with mighty ruins,
With monuments destroyed and temples burned,
Proclaims my greatness in fierce examples
From frozen pole to sunlit beach."
Such another, whose merciless mind is
Defended by impenetrable jasper,
Increases her hardness with my lament.
In a fury, without pity,
Oft she tells me in cruel rough tones,
"In your fire my beauty shines."
While love laughs in the quick tremulous
Light of dancing eyes,
A small flame moves in us as from the glow of a dim torch.
But when tears distress love
I feel a true fire burning in my heart.
Oh, the wonder of the strange power
That from tears can draw a voracious flame!
The sun burns as it breaks its potent rays to enter cold pure water
That sparkles between the allurement and the light.
Oh, prime cause of my sweet misery!
To gaze upon those eyes was my destiny.
This is your way of working, and also the sun's."
The optical analogy may limp but the message seems clear. The poor poet
armed with natural philosophical images chases a flirtatious blonde beauty
with bewitching eyes. Blondes were the preferred type in the Furioso, in Gali­
leo's poems, and in paintings of courtesans." Recipes for entering the blonde
state were a staple of the natural magician. Della Porta offered several after
prescribing a mordant made of honey, the lees of white wine, oil, celandine,
madder, cumin seed, saffron, and box shavings. Apply to the hair and let
remain for 24 hours. Then rinse with a lye made of cabbage stalks, ashes,
and barley straw, "but Rye-Straw is the best: for this, as Women have often
proved, will make the Hair a bright yellow." For the dye itself, you will need
soap and water, barley straw, fenugreek, quicklime, and tobacco." Good
luck.
Galileo wrote about pranks as well as pangs of love during his early
Paduan years. He returned to a comedy perhaps begun in Pisa. Its relatively

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
uncomplicated plot stars Orazio, son of the rich merchant Cassandro, and
Fiammetta (Tittle flame"), the daughter of one Frosino, who are in love. Cas­
sandro forbids the match; Orazio, pining, goes away. Three or four years
later he returns disguised as a woman, becomes a servant in Frosino's house,
"and enjoys the beloved daughter." Frosino conceives a passion for the dis­
guised Orazio; Cassandro, despairing of Orazio's return, decides to marry
again; and, of course, he pitches on Fiammetta. She refusing, Cassandro
implores her servant, that is, his son Orazio, to plead his case. This pro­
duces pleasant complications that can only be imagined since Galileo does
not describe them. Finally, Frosino, driven to distraction by the inexplicable
refusals of his servant, jumps into bed with her, or rather him. To Frosino's
intense disappointment Orazio reveals himself, and marries Fiarnmetta.?'
In developing this hackneyed plot during his Padua tenure, Galileo so com­
plicated it that even he could not extricate his hero Ulivetta (as he rechris­
tened the disguised Orazio) from the mesh he wove. At one point Ulivetta
had two servant lovers, to both of whom he promised herself, while trying
to avoid the attentions of the love-sick Frosino (now Tufano); at the same
time he had in hand two commissions to arrange marriages, one of them
between his father and his lover Diana formerly Fiammetta. The plot breaks
off with over an act to gO.95 One modern critic thinks that if finished it might
have made a pleasant fluff, another that it contains nothing in its "cheerful
and very licentious pages ... for which a comedy comes to be and remains a
great work of art.?"
Galileo may have received the inspiration to revise and expand his Pisan
play from della Porta, who was known for his comedies as well as for his
cosmetics. They met early in 1593. If that half-mad genius Tommaso Cam­
panella is to be believed, Sarpi and Campanella himself were present too.
This formidable quartet had in common a disposition toward free thinking
and entanglement in the disciplinary machinery of the Catholic Church.
When they met, the Congregation of the Index had recently banned one of
della Porta's comedies although the Congregation of the Holy Office had
advised him earlier that it preferred his plays to his magic." Campanella
had already suffered imprisonment by the Inquisition for having ridiculed
a very sound papal injunction excommunicating anyone who removed
a book from the convent library without permission. (Some say he was
also charged with the lesser offences of reading suspect philosophers and
keeping a familiar spirit.) Released, he made his way to Padua, where he

88
GALILEO
was studying at the time the foursome met; he would be in trouble with
the Inquisition, and in one or another of its jails, for most of the next 30
years." For the rest, Sarpi would be excommunicated and almost assas­
sinated, and Galileo would earn perpetual detention at the pleasure of the
Holy Office. Their luncheon together would have made an Inquisitor's
mouth water (Plates 6 and 14).99
3.2 STEADY STATE
Family
In 1599 Galileo took a large house with a garden and a vineyard in via
dei Vignali (now via Galileo) near the Santo, the great religious com­
plex of San Antonio di Padova.''" He needed the space to accommo­
date a coppersmith from the Arsenal, Marcantonio Mazzoleni, whom
he engaged as a live-in instrument maker. There were also Mazzoleni's
family and a few well-to-do students who came for private courses. As
some of them had their own servants and horses, Galileo must have had
a full house and fair-size staff when his establishment was in full swing.
A letter of 1607 to a prospective student boarder affords a glimpse into his
arrangements: the house is neither crowded nor expensive, Galileo wrote,
as it then had only one continuing scholar, who had been in residence for
four years and would continue another two, the slow scholar's brother, and
their page.lOl That was a relative low. For the two years November 1602 to
October 1604, Galileo accommodated 16 students with their retinue of 17
servants. Most came for private instruction in the use of the military com­
pass and fortification, and stayed for as long as their intelligence required
and their incomes permitted. Perhaps Galileo had as many as ten boarders
at a time. In addition to the 16 live-in students of the biennium 1602-04,
Galileo had 12 who boarded elsewhere. Most of them bought his compass.'!"
Usually the income from room charges, instructional fees, and instrument
sales amounted to more than Galileo's salary, which in 1599 was raised from
180 to 320 scudi.''" The gross for the instrument business in 1599/1600 was
1060 lire or 212 scudi (in Venice five lire made a ducat). Against this he had
to take his expenses: 90 scudi for rent, room and board for Mazzoleni and
his family, remuneration of servants, heating, materials, and so on.104 Since

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
as a professor he escaped the tax on wine, he could have lived well enough
on his income. lOS
He had other expenses, however. During his first year at Padua Galileo had
had to outfit his brother Michelangelo for a job-seeking trip to Poland, pro­
vide Livia with a new dress, and meet his brother-in-Iaw's demands for the
balance of Virginia's dowry.'?' In 1593 this awkward relative, Benedetto Lan­
ducci, threatened to have Galileo jailed if he returned to Florence without the
money. Galileo returned and borrowed 200 scudi to discharge the dcbt.''"
That was small stuff. In 1600 Livia, then living discontentedly in a nunnery,
received an offer of marriage. Galileo could do nothing toward a dowry, he
told his mother, since once again he had to equip Michelangelo, who had
returned to Florence in the hope of an appointment at court, for travel and
work. The estimated cost ran to all of Galileo's salary for the year. If Livia
did not like life where she was she could change nunneries. Then, when
Michelangelo could help with expenses and if she still wished to marry, she
could come out and "experience the miseries of this world."!" Livia soon
received another offer and, with Michelangelo's promise to help, Galileo very
generously agreed to the extravagant dowry of 1800 scudi. The wedding took
place in Padua in January 1601. By November, Livia was pregnant and his
new brother-in-law, Taddeo Galletti, exigent. Galileo asked Michelangelo to
oblige himself legally to pay his share. For himself, he wrote, he was tightly
pinched. Michelangelo could not contribute and Galileo had to borrow
another 600 scudi and obtain an advance on his salary to meet his running
expenses and the obligations he had assumed to assist his siblings.'?"
Matters scarcely improved even when, in 1606, Galileo's salary increased
to 520 scudi. Apparently the Riformatori required some persuasion from
Sagredo and Venier, both of whom lent Galileo money and knew his finan­
cial position, to grant the raise.'!" Nevertheless, in 1608 he still owed 1400
scudi to his brothers-in-law, one of whom, Galletti, had tried to sue him in
Venice, and perhaps as much more to his other creditors. I II To all of which
must be added the cost of Galileo's own family, which, by the end of his
Paduan tenure, comprised Marina and their three children, whom Galileo
named after his father and sisters: Virginia, born 1600, now famous as "Gali­
leo's daughter"; Livia, born 1601; and Vincenzo, born 1606.
The family did not live together. A professor dwelling in open concu­
binage would have been anomalous, although during the time that Marina
and Galileo were together patricians might live with their partners without

90
GALILEO
suffering social reprobation. The arrangement was not favored by the state,
however, as overproductive of bastards, or by the church, as opposed to Tri­
dentine discipline, which prescribed excommunication in persistent cases;
and many couples who began irregularly submitted to pressure and mar­
ried.'!' Marina and Galileo did not take this step, perhaps because of dispar­
ity in their social positions. It may be significant that Marina gave birth to
Virginia between Calileo's rejection of Livia's first suitor and his acceptance
(in January 1601) of Galletti. Calileo's life style might have increased the cost
of a respectable husband for Livia. Michelangelo believed that Galileo had
sacrificed his chances for a regular family life to establish his sisters. "I know
that you would tell me to forget about taking a wife and consider our sisters,"
he wrote in reply to Calileo's complaint that he had married with 1400 scudi
of dowry debt outstanding.'!'
One of Calileo's more lucrative ways of raising money was casting hor­
oscopes, for which he ordinarily charged his students 60 lire (12 scudi).
His cashbook for 1603 records five such transactions.'!" His reputation as
a practitioner brought requests and no doubt higher fees from cardinals,
princes, and patricians, including Sagredo, the Morosini, and someone
interested in Sarpi. He corresponded with the grand duke's astrologer, Raf­
faello Gualterotti, and, in hard cases, with an adept in Verona, a physician
named Ottavio Brenzoni.!" At least once Galileo's astrological predictions
reached the accuracy of Copernicus' anticipation of the decline of the Turks
and Kepler's forecast of Wallenstein's death. This was the discovery that the
planet Venus had a decisive influence on Sagredo's character. Galileo did
not need to consult the stars, however, to learn that his friend was "kind,
happy, merry, beneficent, pacific, sociable, and pleasure-loving," and a little
too devoted to women.!"
To do astrological computations correctly required determination of the
relative strengths of all the planets based on many factors: angular distances
from the cardinal points (ascendant, upper and lower meridian, descendant)
and from one another; their relations, of which Galileo considered a half
dozen types (ruler, sex, sect, face ... ), to the zodiacal signs; their motions,
whether swift or slow, ascendant or descendant, direct or retrograde; and
their placement within the "houses," sections of the zodiac cut off by the
horizon, meridian, and certain auxiliary circles, and associated with various
aspects of life.!" It took time, labor, and knowledge to cast and interpret a
geniture. That Galileo took this trouble even when no one paid him for it

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
91
suggests that he ascribed some value to the art. Three of these gratuitous
calculations concerned his daughters and himself.
Galileo calculated his birth chart for the afternoon of 16 February 1564
at least twice, and once for the rsth, if the chart he designated "Georg:
Giocomi [0]" ("George Myass") should also be his. All three charts agree
in what matters: Galileo's rising sign is Leo, his sun is in Pisces (in one
case, Aquarius) in the eighth house (death) and Saturn and Jupiter are in
conjunction and retrograde in Cancer in the eleventh house (animosity).
Even a novice astrologer can see that there are some bad influences at work
here. No wonder Galileo was melancholic. We do not have his elucidation
of the significance of the conjoined retrograde planets unfavorably placed
in the Crab, of the combative Mars glowering at the horoscope from the
midheaven, or of the sun and the inferior planets drowning among the
descending Fish. However, an ingenious recent astrologer has interpreted
one of Galileo's sonnets as a poetical résumé of the chart's meaning.118
Here it is:
Darting forth flames, the celestial lamp
Burning in the lion ascends into the sky.
Every zephyr ceases, and the world kindles
Under a blaze from the ardent south.
The earth below and the heavens above grow hot
Striking with a double heat to inflame the air.
And the fish hardly can escape the
Heat that reaches the sea by diving to the depths.
The birds, the beasts, and the tired vanquished flock
Seek grottoes, caves, dark valleys
That protect from the withering rays.
But you, poor heart, in your burning breast enflamed,
What protection can you find?
I believe it can be nothing but cold death."?
On this reading, what appears to be a love lament in Petrarchan mode is a
commentary on the aspects and prospects of a native born on a very hot day
in July. Despite that happy hit of the uncomfortable fish, the poem seems
unlikely to represent red-hot influences on the infant Galileo, who was born
in February.

92
GALILEO
We know exactly how Galileo interpreted charts with the sun rising in
Leo, as both of his daughters were born in August. Here is what the stars
said about Virginia.!"
Virginia's temperament:
P[rim]o, although Mercury and the Moon are separated and have no
aspect to one another, nonetheless they indicate a certain discord
between the rational and the emotional powers. Because Mercury is
very strong and in a ruling sign [Virgo] and the Moon is weak and in a
subject sign, reason will dominate desire.
Saturn the signifier of character is very strong, which tends to
bestow a correct and severe temperament although mixed with some
nastiness. This, however, is moderated and tempered by beneficent
Jupiter in a robust sextile aspect. This makes her patient in work and
trouble, solitary, taciturn, frugal, concerned with her own comforts,
jealous, and not always truthful in promises.
The Sun also well placed [in its ruling sign Leo] bestows a certain
pride of reason and character.
Spica in the ascendent adds charm and religion. The rising human
sign Libra lends humanity and gentleness.
Her aptitude:
As to her natural genius, Mercury, so well placed on several counts,
promises intelligence and the association of Jupiter increases wisdom,
prudence, and humanity.
Saturn, also fruitful and powerful, will strongly assist memory.
Libra, rising with several planets, favors her talents, and ... [the MS
breaks off].
A year later Galileo had to repeat the operation:
Livia's temperament:
Mercury and the Moon in separated signs indicate a certain discord
between the rational power of the soul and the disposition of the senses:
however, the very well placed Mercury [in Virgo, conjoined with Jupiter
and in sextile to Venus] overcomes the weak Moon so that the emotional
side is completely subjected to the rational. Mercury here is the significa­
tor of character, conjoined with Jupiter and both in benign sextile aspect
to Venus, gives a disposition with very nice and praiseworthy traits.

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
93
Also Spica, preceding Mercury, combines charm with grace and
religion: thus she will be very keen in mind, gentle, cautious, talented
at everything, poet, mathematician, learning on her own, a good com­
panion, accommodating to every occasion and person.
Her aptitude:
Mercury being very strong in the ascendant shows a natural genius
adjusted to all things; and by its association with Jupiter adds knowledge,
probity, simplicity, erudition, prudence, humanity. Venus being in sextile
wondrously increases quickness and grace of speech and character.
There is this caveat, however, that because of the unfortunate
position of the Moon, she might understand fully but resolve badly,
and deliberate well for others but poorly for herself.
Although Galileo worked out the significant aspects of both charts in detail,
his interpretations turned almost entirely on the positions of the planets
relative to the horizon and one another, and on the standard association of
Mercury with reason and the Moon with emotion. In both nativities Mer­
cury, being in the ascendant in an equable sign (Libra, house of the autumnal
equinox) and accompanied by other planets, is well placed to imprint his
rationalizing spirit, more strongly and pleasantly in Livia's case, where his
companions are beneficent (the sun, Jupiter) than in Virginia's, where they
are trouble makers (Mars, Saturn). In both cases, the separation between the
rational signifier Mercury and the emotional Moon is around 90 degrees,
which confers some opposition and suggests a little disharmony. But Livia
did not have much to worry about because her bad Moon, being under the
earth and in opposition to its house, is very weak. Variations in the Moon's
place and in Mercury's partners account for the differences in the girls'
characters.
This analysis comes straight from the most authoritative of astrologi­
cal guides, Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos. "Of the qualities of the soul, those which
concern the reason and the mind are apprehended by means of the condi­
tion of Mercury ... and the qualities of the sensory and irrational part are
discerned from the ... Moon." The stronger Mercury is, the keener the intel­
lect; the more prominent the Moon, the more the feminine traits of charac­
ter express themselves. The effect of good company appears from Ptolemy's
description of a Mercury allied with Jupiter: natives result who are "learned,
fond of discussion, geometricians, mathematicians, poets, orators ... good

94
GALILEO
natured, generous ... philosophical, dignified." In good aspect with Venus,
Mercury produces "artistic, philosophical [people], gifted with understand­
ing, talented, poetic, lovers of the muses ... sagacious, resourceful, intellec­
tual, intelligent, successful, quick to learn, self-taught ... " On the other hand,
Saturn and Mercury at best make "meddlers ... fond of the art of medicine,
mystics ... shrewd, bitter, accurate, sober, friendly, fond of practical affairs,
capable of gaining their ends"; and, at worst, "frivolous talkers, malignant,
with no pity in their souls, given to toil, hating their own kin, fond of tor­
ment, gloomy ... "121
Galileo's interpretation omitted many of the questions customarily asked
of genitures, like length of life, fortune, and illnesses. It was one thing to
suppose that planetary influences could imprint the fresh soul of the newly
born, quite another to derive from the heavens foreknowledge of events.
Astrology could be helpful without making predictions. Does your geniture
indicate sensitivity to the sun? Then retire to a cool place when the sun is in
Cancer. "And in this way [thus Galileo's predecessor Moletti] judgments of
astrologers should be understood, and not in any other form."!" The degree
of Galileo's personal commitment to astrology is as hard to divine as his
politics. That he subscribed to it in the form in which he deployed it in his
daughters' nativities seems likely. That he sold or offered astrological advice
for another 20 years or more is incontestable. The accuracy of his predic­
tions, even when given "almost as a joke," could astonish their recipients. In
Sed contra, Calileo's role model Sarpi, having studied astrology carefully and
sympathetically, had declared it rubbish. "I hold to very few things about
which I am not prepared to change my mind; but if I believe anything for
sure it is this, that judicial astrology is pure nonsense."!"
Academy
Pinelli's death in August 1601 deprived Padua of its literary center. He left his
collections to a Neopolitan relative, Duke Cosimo d'Acerenza, who also suf­
fered from bibliophilia. The duke engaged three ships to transport his inherit­
ance to Naples. Pirates captured one and being indifferent readers vented their
frustration by throwing a third of the books into the sea. Fisherman netted
some rarities and sent them on to Naples. Meanwhile the duke had died. His
widow sold the lot at auction in which the Society of Jesus and the Cardinal
Archbishop of Milan, Federico Borromeo, fought it out. Borromeo outbid

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
95
the Jesuits and brought his purchase safely to Milan as the nucleus of a library
named for the city's one-time bishop Saint Ambrose. This became the famous
Ambrosiana, which still houses the part of Pinelli's library that survived the
bombs of the Second World War.125
A new Pinelli was already on hand when the old one died. This was Anto­
nio Querenghi, who had been at the university with Sarpi and returned to
his native Padua in 1597 as a cathedral canon. While on the road he had made
a friend of the future Clement VIII and other influential churchmen and had
begun to assemble a library. He was a classical scholar, poet, theologian, and
rhapsodic mathematician, and, like his good friend Paolo Gualdo, fond of
jokes and Jesuits. "Monsignore is a man who loves peace and quiet, prizes
his bed as if it were the fifth element, and dislikes peripatetics; he thinks of
nothing else than how to recover Archimedes' trick of pulling a boat along
the ground so that he can go in a gondola overland whenever he pleases ... 126
Pinelli's circle became Querenghi's; Gualdo, Sarpi, Galileo, and Pignoria were
members.':" Querenghi's library was not quite half of Pinelli's (3,000 against
6,500 volumes) but larger in doubtful works: foreign imprints, magic, and
astrology, with emphasis on the works, published and manuscript, of the
consummate astrologer Girolamo Cardano. No doubt it also contained a
copy of Sixtus V's bull of 1586 "against judicial astrology and every other sort
of divination." Galileo would have found in Querenghi's library everything
he needed to cast the birth charts of Virginia and Livia including Cardano's
commentaries on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos.128
Querenghi and his friends also met at the Accademia dei Ricovrati, a
learned society set up in 1599. Its 26 founding members listed themselves in
order of merit as determined by its founder, the young abbot (and monsig­
nore) Federico Cornaro. His qualification? He had been educated at Padua in
"all the sciences most fitting to a true gentleman." Cornaro put Galileo in rsth
place, eight below Crernonini.!" The group spent its first two years making
itself interesting and conspicuous. A solemn public inauguration attended by
all city officials, professors in the university, and, exceptionally, their wives,
followed a high mass at the Santo. There were few speakers and much music.
Then the academicians got down to the serious business that would occupy
them for months: the design of imprese, the emblems and mottoes peculiar to
each member and the corporate logo peculiar to them all. At a very private
session on 23 May 1600, Galileo received the sensitive assignment of review­
ing, revising, and, when necessary, rejecting his colleagues' imprese. Since the

GALILEO
shield and slogan were to demonstrate the learning, cleverness, and artistry
of its owner, Cornaro evidently valued Galileo's scholarship as well as his
buon gusto and, what may be unexpected, his diplomacy,'?'
Galileo also helped with the corporate logo. What would be appropriate
for a group calling themselves ricovrati, that is, inmates of a (mental) hospital?
Taking the association seriously, Galileo chose as his academic name Abba­
tutto, "depressed," perhaps with his financial and familial circumstances in
mind. As the academy's impresa he favored a two-mouthed cave bearing the
legend bipatens animis asylum, "an asylum for souls with two entries."!" Clever
people might have recognized the words as a paraphrase of a line from
Boethius's Consolation of philosophy and the cave as an illustration of a scene in
Homer's Odyssey. Boethius had written, Hoc patens unum miseris asylum: "Here
maya wretch have refuge from his pains." The wretchedness in question is
that of everyone ensnared by the senses, in all senses: addiction to material
things, trust in sense impressions, ignorance of the good and the true.!"
The airy cave belonged to the naiads, a species of water nymph. It had
an involved symbolism. One entrance, to the North, received humans; the
other, to the South, gods only. The cave contained a loom of stone and a
hive of bees.!" It appears that the Accademia dei Ricovrati was a naiads'
cave in which Galileo and his fellow nymphs could be cured of their illness
by hard work and divine enlightenment. Querenghi specified the nature of
the hard work needed. It begins in a more famous cave, that of Plato's Repub­
lic, where people imprisoned by their senses perceive reality only dimly, via
shadows on the cave walls. The road out begins with arithmetic. "Let no one
ignorant of mathematics enter here," read the doorposts of Plato's Acad­
emy; "let no one ignorant of geometry leave here," read the exit sign from
Homer's cave.
Galileo remained active in the Academy of Inmates for a few years, rising
in 1602 to the office of censor of books submitted for its imprimatur.!" But
he, Cremonini, and other serious savants drifted away as their colleagues
took up the sort of literary questions that Galileo had enjoyed during his gap
years: What is the best way to woo? Can you love more than one woman at
a time? Does Tasso's Rinaldo act more from love or honorr!" Galileo had
more serious claims on his spare time: private teaching, instrument business,
spasmodic research. One of the spasms concerned magnetism. Sarpi seems
to have started it. As an expert on magnetism and a friend of heretics, he
was perhaps the first Italian reader of the inspirational De magnete of Queen

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
97
Elizabeth I's physician William Gilbert. This book, published in London in
1600, reports the first sustained, systematic experimental inquiry into any
branch of natural philosophy. Many of Gilbert's experiments used a "terrella,"
a simulacrum of the earth made from a spherical lodestone, with which he
demonstrated among many other things that a magnetic needle able to rotate
around a horizontal axis dipped beneath the horizon when placed in the
magnetic meridian. To show the phenomenon, he moved a "versorium," a
short compass needle appropriately pivoted, around his terella. Measurement
of the angle of dip required in addition that the lodestone be perfectly spheri­
cal, the poles well defined, the needle very short and perfectly magnetized,
and the versorium placed exactly in the magnetic meridian. Then the great
question was to find a rule that related dip angle to latitude.
The angular displacement I.l of the versorium at a latitude <I> with respect
to its orientation at the equator equals <I> plus 8, the measured dip (Figure 3.8).
At the poles, I.l = 180° because each of its constituents is 90°. Gilbert ascribed
the phenomenon to a new physical agency, a special magnetic virtue, a "dis­
posing and rotating influence."!" Sarpi liked the mystery of magnetism,
which he often used to illustrate the epistemological difficulty in reasoning
about physical entities we cannot detect immediately by sense. (We can see
a lodestone draw iron filings and feel one dropped on the toe but we cannot
detect magnetism directly.) To natural philosophers who held that magnet­
ism was an irreducible occult quality (which meant that it owed its action to
a hidden cause), Sarpi replied that it is occult only in the sense that a blind

its deeper nature. Gilbert's dip pointed to deep things; Fra Paolo turned his
powerful mind upon it.
At the equator and the poles, everything seemed clear. And in between?
Sarpi raised the question with Galileo in conversation and then by letter.

Gilbert had given a complicated geometrical rule for obtaining � and thence
8 (Figure 3.9). "How did he find his method, by experiment or reason?"
Sarpi answered his own question: not by experiment, since that would
have required either traveling all over the world or having a versorium far
more sensitive than any procurable; nor by reason, since Gilbert could not
explain the principles underlying his exotic diagram. Why did he draw those
circles and divide them as he did? "Please think about my difficulties and
supply what is wanting in our author, who has withheld the causes of the
most obscure things." Galileo made versoria for experiments and no doubt
also for sale. "Please tell me how to make them," Sarpi asked, "how to fix the
pivot ... everything. 138
Sagredo joined in the inquiry and Galileo sent him some magnets.139
One of them, "a real Rodomonte," had great potential. To realize it, to fit an
armature, Sagredo needed Galileo's help.':" Soon he had a double Rodomonte,
wherewith he experimented diligently with no known advantage to science.
He gave it to Galileo for sale to Grand Duke Ferdinando, who wanted one
that could pull a sword from a strong man, or, at a minimum, support its
own weight of iron. During the dickering over price, Galileo busied him­
self enhancing the magnet's attractiveness. When he received it, the double
Rodomonte could hold five pounds, a little more than its weight.':" By
resourceful application of Gilbert's hints about improving performance
and his own stubborn ingenuity, Galileo had managed almost to double the
weight the magnet could lift when, in the spring of 1608, he dispatched it to
Florence.!" Galileo included in his shipment a few instruments and mag­
netized bits of iron to demonstrate the magnet's strength "and some other
stupendous discoveries I have made with it." The stone deserved a place in
the grand duke's cabinet. Galileo suggested that it bear the emblem, vim facit
amor, "love makes power," to indicate the jurisdiction given by God to just
and enlightened rulers. This was a typical progression for Galileo: from
episodic engagement in a problem of physics stimulated by questions from
friends or students through the development of instruments for business,
presents, and research, to a few respectable results, "miraculous, marvelous,"
bestowed where they might do a poor professor the most good.':"
The students in Galilee's private academy included many foreigners, sev­
eral from the land of Copernicus, and some hangers on, rather like post­
graduates, who had reasons to remain in Padua.':" Among the latter, two
monks from the Benedictine monastery of Santa Giustina became disciples.

GALILEO
Dom Girolamo Spinelli would collaborate with Galileo and Querenghi in
1605 in a pseudonymous reply to a philosopher who had had the effrontery
to impugn mathematicians. Dom Benedetto Castelli (Plate 9) became almost
a son to Galileo, a trusted adviser, personal agent, and, in his turn, a pseu­
donymous collaborator. Austere but not humorless, pious and fiercely loyal,
he once proposed the monkish remedy of burning the books of Galileo's
enernies.!" First among these malefactors was another hanger-on, Baldas­
sar Capra, whose sin was to publicize the most lucrative of Calileo's instru­
ments, his geometrical and military compass, without troubling to disclose
that he, Capra, had not invented it. The instrument enabled adepts to cal­
culate many useful things quickly. To protect his monopoly, Galileo had
instructions for its use copied out by hand for each purchaser. Because the
instruction booklet contained no illustrations, it made little sense without
the instrument. When equipped with both, "anyone of average intelligence"
could master it.146 Let us see.
Galileo's compass consists of two flat arms striped with radial scales and
hinged together at one end (Figure 3.10). It performs calculations by propor­
tion according to the angle of opening. The prototypical case requires the
solution of x:a = b:c. The operator picks out the distances band c "lengthwise"
along the two symmetric scales, or "arithmetical lines," marked on the com­
pass arms and opens the compass until the distance a just fits "crosswise"

between the marks for b. Then the distance crosswise between the marks for c
is x (Figure j.n). Galileo explained how to apply the technique to map scaling
and currency conversion (Venetian ducats to Florentine lire in his predictable
example), and compound interest (by repeated application of the process).'?
The concept of a pocket calculator in the form of a compass was not new
with Galileo. Among his predecessors, both authors and transmitters, were
Pinelli, Moletti, Giacomo Contarini, Coignet, and, above all, Guidobaldo
del Monte. They shared a widespread interest in measuring and calculat­
ing instruments for surveyors, builders, and military men; an interest that,
according to a bibliography published by Galileo's former student Levinus
Hulsius in 1604, had produced seventy pertinent books during the previous
half century.':" The particular merits of Galilee's version lay in the nature and
arrangement of its scales, which underwent several modifications between
its earliest form described to Pinelli in 1597 and the definitive one of 1604.
The arithmetical lines were the last added, apparently because problems
involving areas (surveying) and weights and volumes (gunnery) were more
pressing and difficult. The arithmetical lines transformed a specialty instru­
ment into a general calculator.':"
To handle areas, Galileo inscribed "geometrical lines" scaled to the square
roots of integers from 1 to 50. With them finding the mean proportion
between a and b, that is, the solution of x2 = ab, could not be easier: make
marks at �b and �a; open the compass so that a fits crosswise between the
marks --.Ja; x is the line that runs between the marks at ...Jb (Figure 3.12). Say
you have Q soldiers to arrange in a rectangle whose front is to its flank as
5:3. How many soldiers wide and deep should you make the army? Galileo
reduced the problem to finding the value of x for which 15X2 = Q. In his
example, Q = 4335, which he rounded down to 4300 and wrote as 43·100.

Then 5X = 5o�(Q/100)·--.)15 = 50�(43/15). The front 5X therefore is the cross­
wise distance between the marks for --.)43 when the compass is open so that
50 fits between the marks for --.)15. The front works out to 85; with 30 in place
of 50 crosswise, the flank is 51 and the army 4335.150
We rise to "stereometrie lines," scaled to the cube roots of the integers up
to 148. The operations of enlarging or reducing a solid, of taking a cube root,
and of finding mean proportionals brings nothing new,!" Next to the stere­
ometrie lines Galileo's compass carried his most important help to the artist
of war: "metallie lines," scaled as the inverse cube roots of the densities of the
materials. Do you wish to know how much a silver statue will weigh equal in
size to a marble one weighing Q pounds? Then you must find x such that x:Q
= 8 Ag:8Ma. Do you want to know the weight of a cannon ball of any material
and any size from knowledge of the size and weight of a standard cannon
ball, and hence the relative charges needed to fire them?"? The calculation
will not be pursued here lest it fall into the wrong hands.
Calileo's compass had a reverse side, with lines for geometrieal work,
such as finding the side of a regular polygon for inscription in a given circle,
squaring a circle or rectangular figure, and, what was new, "additional lines"
for finding areas of segments of circles. Having mastered all this, the stu­
dent was only half way through his course. He could acquire an additional
device from Galileo to turn the compass into a surveying instrument good
for taking distances to enemy locations and fixing the elevations of muzzles.
This deviee was a quadrant similar to ones long in use but adapted to fit onto
the compass with its arms open to 90°. Galileo's instructions included direc­
tions for finding heights and distances; here he provided diagrams, presuma­
bly because he had nothing to add to the usual techniques and rcpcrtoire.!»

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA

Galileo did not date his instructions nor did Mazzoleni sign or date the
compasses. This oversight, combined with the fact that Galileo did not invent
the instrument from whole cloth, made an irresistible opening to academic
buccaneers. In 1603 he learned that a Dutchman, Jan Eutel Zieckmesser,
was showing a compass similar to his. That was bad for business. Galileo
challenged Zieckmesser to a duel with compasses drawn at the palace of
the Cornaros. The witnesses present agreed that in most respects the weap­
ons had been fashioned independently, and declared a draw,'?" Then came
Capra. This scapegrace had received lessons in the use of the compass from
Galileo, who thought he had the makings of a good astrologer, and copies
of the booklet and the instrument from Giacomo Alvise Cornaro, at whose
house the lessons had taken place. Soon Capra also had an authoritative
printed copy of the instructions. Galileo had run the risk of publishing them
to secure the patronage of the Medici crown prince, Cosimo, whom he had
tutored in the use of the compass during the summer of 1605, and to whom
he dedicated the instruction booklet and the instrument. He minimized the
risk of unauthorized access by printing only 60 copies, without illustrations,
on a press in his own house. These precautions did not defeat Capra. He
reissued the booklet in a Latin paraphrase with a very nice drawing showing
crosswise fitting (Figure 3.10).155
With equal effrontery, Capra's quack physician father gave a copy of the
plagiarism to Cornaro. Alerted by him, Galileo collected testimonials from
Sarpi, Querenghi, and others to whom he had shown versions of the compass
over the preceding decade, and arranged to examine Capra on his knowledge
of compass principles before university authorities. Poor Baldassar! He failed
the test. The authorities confiscated his book and threw him out of the uni­
versity.!" That did not satisfy Galileo, who published a brief, brutal rebuttal
of the goat (la capra) who had got his goat.!"
The ferocity of Galileo's counterattack betrays his need for the money
the compass earned him. By 1610 he had sold some 300 instruments. At 150
lire each, they brought him 450 lire a year for over a decade. If expenses for
materials and Mazzoleni amounted to half of that, he cleared say 2,000 lire
or 400 ducats a year, about half his academic salary over the decade. And he
anticipated that his compass income would rise. Military men as well as poets
sought his advice about their art. From Florence came a request from a general
just returned from a victorious siege for help with artillery. From Venice came
a request from another soldier, Pietro Duodo, for a mathematical curriculum

104
GALILEO
for a new Venetian military school called the Accademia Delia. Instruction
would include the use of the military compass. Curiously, the first Delian lec­
turer in mathematics, Ingolfo de' Conti, had not been able to afford to take
private lectures from Galileo.!" But, although the stakes were high, pecuni­
ary interest alone seems insufficient to explain the nastiness of the counter to
Capra that Galileo himself later admitted was excessive. As will appear, the
missing motive must be sought in the stars, and an affair of honor.
Church
There was another traitor in the Scuola Galileiana. On 21 April 1604, Sil­
vestro Pagnoni, who had worked for Galileo for a year and a half as a copy­
ist, presented himself "spontaneously," which often meant, as in this case,
on the urging of his confessor, before the nearest inquisitor. His conscience
forced him to disclose that his former employer cast horoscopes. Pagnoni
volunteered further that during his 18 months in Galileo's house he saw
his master go to mass only once, and then to look up his ecclesiastical
friend Querenghi. "I never knew him to go to confession." Question: "With
whom does Galileo associate?" Answer: "With Cremonini, almost every
day, and [what was not compromising] with the illustrious Giacomo Alvise
[Cornaro]." The rascal then allowed that Galileo had never mistreated him
and that, in his opinion, Galileo, though a poor Christian, believed in "mat­
ters of faith." Inquisitor: "You have said that Galileo gives certain judgment
about the nativities he makes: this is a heresy; how could you then say that
he believes in matters of faith?" Pagnoni took the hint and hit again. "I know
that I said this and that he does give certain judgment about the nativities,
but I did not know that this had been declared heretical."!"
Pagnoni then enriched his testimony with some precious details about
Galilee's dealings with his mistress and his mother. During a visit to Galileo
in 1603/4, Giulia had enlisted Pagnoni to spy on her son. He duly relayed her
confidences to the inquisitor:
I've understood from his mother that he never makes confession or
takes communion, and she asked me to find out whether he went to
mass on feast days. I observed that instead of going to mass he went to
the house of his Venetian prostitute Marina .... I believe that his mother
went to the Holy Office in Florence against him and [or because?] he

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
105
called her terrible names, puttana, gabrina. And she said that the Floren­
tine Holy Office issued him an admonition to him.
The first bit is no doubt true. Probably the Florentine incident deserves credit
toO.160
The Venetian authorities had no trouble seeing that Pagnoni acted through
spite and that his charges were "very frivolous and of no importance." Gali­
leo had to teach astrology; there was no reason that he should not practice
it also; and Pagnoni certainly had not shown that Galileo interpreted the
charts fatalistically,"! Galileo's private life was no business of the Inquisition.
The weakness of Pagnoni's charges is perhaps their most interesting feature.
Despite Galileo's compromising friendships with Cremonini and Sarpi, his
earlier exposure to Averroistic interpretations by Borro and Buonamici, his
school of foreign heretics, and his dissolute life style, Pagnoni could not find
anything derogatory to say about Galileo's religious beliefs. Galileo had many
friends and supporters among the clergy and among laymen close to the
Jesuits. He detested true libertines like Crernonini's student Antonio Rocco,
whose licentious defence of homosexuality, L'Alcibiade fanciullo a scuola, pub­
lished in 1650 but no doubt long meditated, teaches that Moses invented the
story of Sodom to stop men from preferring boys to women grown ugly
after 40 years of wandering in the desert."? Galileo liked ribaldry but not
blasphemy.
The inquisitors did not need Pagnoni's hint to interrogate Cremonini, who
had already come to their attention as a corrupter of youth and promoter of
disbelief. The view was widely held even outside the thought police. Sagre­
do's father thought that Cremonini spread atheism and alumni like Rocco
gave color to the charge. Former students popped up now and then to accuse
Cremonini of leading them astray."? In 1604 one of his colleagues, Camillo
Belloni, professor of moral philosophy at the university and a fellow Ricov­
rato, took up the cause. Belloni exploited the occasion of a Lenten sermon,
in which a Jesuit preached against discussing the doctrine of the mortality
of the soul in courses on Aristotle, to denounce Cremonini and relieve his
own conscience.
The Riformatori knew perfectly well that Belloni and Cremonini had
carried academic dispute to the point of fisticuffs. They ordered the Rettori
to squelch the processes against the greatest philosopher and the primary
mathematician of their university, "it being altogether improper that people

106
GALILEO
should make use of the services and respectable office of the Inquisition to
settle personal quarrels."164 The inquisitor agreed, no doubt encouraged by
the knowledge that Cremonini took the sacraments at the recommended
intervals, taught religiously at Santa Giustina, and regarded astrology as
nonsense.!" Galileo's file was archived so imaginatively that it took almost
400 years to resurface. Cremonini's had been sent to Rome, where it joined a
growing mass of dcnunciations.!" Contact with the Inquisition was an ever­
present hazard for scholars in Counter-Reformation Italy. Often it resulted in
a warning, a reprimand, or a dismissal, and sometimes in a brief stay in jail.
Many charges had little to do with faith or morals, but indulged jealousies
or settled scores. As usual in Italy, outcomes depended on family connec­
tions (inquisitors had relatives) and influential contacts (inquisitors listened
to princes) as well as on the acumen and judgment of the bureaucrats of cor­
rect thinking. The Inquisition was a fact of life, of many peoples' lives, a sort
oflow-Ievel background terrorism, and they learned to live with it according
to their circumstances.
The terror increased for everyone living in Venetian territory in April
1606 when Paul V excommunicated the most serene Doge and Senate and
put the entire population of Venice under interdict. Paul expected that his
order, which prohibited clergy in Venice from performing mass or serving
sacraments, would force a hasty surrender from a government threatened
with the unrest of Christian subjects deprived of the solace of marriage and
burial. The immediate cause of Paul's wrath was the Republic's claim of juris­
diction over two priests accused of serious crimes and its clampdown on
giving or willing landed property to the Church. Venetian efforts at negotia­
tion, in which Calileo's military friend Pietro Duodo played a conspicuous
part, failed to move the pope. Paul had not taken the measure of the men he
dealt with. After recalling Duodo, the excommunicated officials ordered the
secular clergy in Venetian territory to ignore the interdict; they ejected reli­
gious orders identified with the Counter Reformation, first the Jesuits, then
the Capuchins and Theatines; and they took every opportunity to display
respect for the Catholic religion. Attendance at mass shot up when the wor­
shipper could cleanse his soul by spiting the pope.!"
Galileo watched the evicted Jesuits, each carrying a candle and a cru­
cifix, leave Venice, "to the pain and sorrow of many women devoted to
them."!" It was not a matter for mockery. The interdict was to last a year
and the expulsion almost 50. Although neither the Serene Republic nor the

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
107
Apostolic See was a major military power, their conflict had the potential
of escalating into a war on Italian soil involving France and Spain and of
driving Venice into the Protestant camp. In the event, hostilities took place
mainly on paper. The greatest champions were men of central importance
in Galileo's story: for the Venetians, Fra Paolo, newly appointed to canon­
ist and theologian of the Republic; for the Romans, Cardinal Bellarmine,
admirer and advisor of Paul V, and longtime professor of controversial
theology at the Jesuit College in Rome. They set out clearly the opposition
between a world order based on an outmoded conception of Christendom
and a world disorder based on the Machiavellian concept of raison d'état. "It
was the function of the interdict, assisted by the growing inclinations of
Europeans in the period to deal in rigid absolutes, to classify, systematize,
and at last bring fully to the surface the antithesis between the political and
cultural achievements of the Italian Renaissance and the ideals of medie­
val Catholicism, now invigorated by the Counter Reformation."!" Galileo
would expose a similar antithesis by insisting on the independent authority
of his physico-mathematics.
Among the eloquent supporters of the state was Cremonini, who, in
speaking once again for the faculty, praised Doge Donà for defending true
religion from those who had "dared to poison the faith at its very source.'?"
Crernonini's reference to pollution of the pure water echoed a leitmotiv in
Sarpi's arguments. The Pope must be opposed in the interest of religion.
Princes consecrated by God had the right and duty to intervene to save the
church from error and presumption. It is a heresy, Fra Paolo advised, to
declare as necessary to the faith a belief that is not so and then to force others
to accept it. The fewer the dogmas and the fewer the Jesuits, the better the
system. Sarpi appealed to history to make the case that the Roman church
had not been faithful to its founders."! Bellarmine replied by pointing to the
lengthy official Catholic history created by his close friend Cardinal Cesare
Baronio, which argued the improbable thesis that the church had not changed
in any significant way since its earliest days. To deny or challenge this history,
wrote Bellarmine, "can be called heresy in history and temerity in theology,
because it is repugnant to all the histories and sacred canons." As Sarpi said,
Counter-Reformation Rome hinted at new heresies all too easily. He pro­
posed as a partial defense introducing the critical study of history into the
university, and showed the way himself, by writing an unflattering account
of the Council of Trent.l'?

108
GALILEO
Paul withdrew the interdict in April 1607. The Venetians surrendered little
in return apart from the two criminal clerics whose case had prompted the
affair. They went to the King of France to dispose of as he wished. The laws
against alienating property remained on the books. Soon, however, dissen­
sions suppressed by the need for concerted action against Rome stirred.
Lucrative papal appointments beguiled prominent members of the Donà­
Sarpi camp. Others came to see that Venice's continuing rapid loss of com­
merce reduced its independence of action and made cooperation with Rome
rnandatory.!" As the resistance to Rome softened, the Inquisition and cen­
sorship returned to normal. In 1609 Sarpi complained that the Venetian
printing presses put out nothing but books of devotion and that papal agents
opened his correspondence outside Venice.':"
On 5 October 1607, five assassins tried to dispatch Sarpi. A crowd forced
the bunglers to take refuge in the house of the papal nuncio. They left one
of their daggers buried in Fra Paolo's face. "I recognize the stilo romano," he
is said to have quipped after its removal. He received the solicitous atten­
tion of Donà and other magnates, the good wishes of the people, and the
care of the great Acquapendente. He recovered. Other attempts on his life
were made, but in the end the Holy Office had to be content with burning
his books rather than his person.!" By 1613 Sarpi's communication chan­
nels with the wider world had silted up. Although he continued to hold his
appointment as state theologian, he devoted his time to writing history and
to thinking through a world order determined by the struggle between "a
few lonely champions of virtue and piety and a handful of wicked men at
the Curia."!" That was the way that Galileo came to see himself in relation to
ecclesiastical authority.
Close observers of Sarpi might have concluded that an accomplished
savant strongly supported by a vigorous and virtuous prince could be an
influential public servant and an effective reformer of clerical abuses. They
would also have recognized that in a busy republic, where many voices must
be heard and the span of attention is short, "everyday new things appear
and take away the importance of the old." Even a strong prince like Donà
could not do what he pleased against the legitimate interests of his fellow
patricians. And, of course, observers of Sarpi would find confirmation, if
any were needed, that Counter Reformation Rome was quick with the charge
of heresy even where matters of faith did not enter, and did not scruple to
destroy people it considered threats to its interests. Sarpi-watcher Galileo

LIFE IN THE SERENISSIMA
109
could see himself as the accomplished savant advising the virtuous prince,
and perceived that a single-minded tyrant might be easier to serve than a
multiheaded republic. He seems to have missed the possible application
to himself of the Roman hierarchy's inclination to hint at heresy to silence
people it found threatening. A good test for a free thinker thinking to relo­
cate from Padua to Florence in the early seventeenth century was the dif­
ferential reception in Italy of a book on the divine right of kings by no less
a prince than James I of England. Venice read it, Rome prohibited it, and in
Florence Grand Duke Ferdinand had his confessor burn it.!"

Galilean Science
4.1 RELUCTANT ASTRONOMER
Although his job description did not oblige him to create new knowledge,
Galileo used his last years at Padua-the years of relatively stable life with
Marina-to arrive at a new, fundamentally important treatment of motion.
He also made some progress toward a new cosmology. He worked harder and
more seriously than he had at Pisa. He could have said with Shakespeare's
Lucentio, "I have Pisa left I And to Padua come, as he that leaves I a shallow
plash, to plunge him in the deep." An indication of what he found in the
depths follows. It may not be for all tastes. As Lucentio's servant reminded
his master, poetry, rhetoric, and music were amusing pursuits, but not so
Aristotle. For the rest, "The mathematics and the metaphysics I Fall to them
as your stomach serves you I No profit grows where no pleasure ta'en."
The Copernican confession
It was fortunate for Professor Galilei that astronomy could not get at the
truth. He could teach Ptolemy and prefer Copernicus with a clear conscience.
He had formed his preference while teaching at Pisa, or perhaps earlier, as
appears from the long letter he wrote to Mazzoni in 1597:
Turning ... to the agreement of your opinions with those I regard as
true even if they differ from ordinary ideas, I confess that I hold more
strongly to them than I did at first, when I did not think that I had such
strong support. To say the truth, however, as much as I was certain
also about the other conclusions, so much was I confused and timid at

GALILEAN SCIENCE
111
the first attack, seeing you so resolute and openly in opposition to the
opinions of Pythagoras and Copernicus on the place and movement of
the earth, which I held to be more probable than the opinion of Aris­
totle and Ptolemy.'
Now bolder and firmer, Galileo told his former mentor that an argument
Mazzoni had devised against Copernicus had no force.
Among Aristotle's sins against mathematics that Mazzoni picked on was
a report that the sun shines on Mount Caucasus for a third of the night.
Let AI (Figure 4.1) be the mountain, OH the horizon at I, B the sun's posi­
tion at last visibility, a = 60°. Since the earth's radius r is negligible in com­
parison with the solar distance Be, angle BC] is almost a right angle and
angle AC] = a = 60°. From cosöo" = cos a = rj(r + h), h must equal r, that is,
3.579 miles. Quite a mountain! On the advice of the mathematician Scipi­
one Chiaramonti, who would become an antagonist and target of Galileo,
Mazzoni allowed that Aristotle might have meant that a third of the moun­
tain glowed when the lower two-thirds had gone dark. Then, taking a = 6°
as the extent of twilight, 2h/3 = 20 miles and h = 30 miles, "which does not
seem Impossible."?
From this considerable height an observer would see a conical horizon
192° in extent. It occurred to Mazzoni that a Copernican observer would
have an even wider panorama, since his platform would be much farther
from the center of his world than a Ptolemaic observer on the top of Mount
Caucasus would be from the center of the earth. But our horizon does

not usually exceed 180°. "Therefore Copernicus' placement of the earth is
false and impossible." Galileo answered that the analogy did not hold: the
operative parameter in the first case is the distance above the earth, in the
second, distance from the center. A prettily packaged piece of geometry
made clear the distinction. In the same figure, let L be the place of the earth
on the Copernican hypothesis and the arc BFE the extent of the heavens
visible from it at noon; in this case the sun is at C. A Ptolemaic observer
at A who saw the same arc BFE above him would stand on a mountain
r(seca - 1) miles high. Using standard Ptolemaic values s = 1216r, R = 45,225f,
and r = 3035 miles, where sand R are the radii of the sun's orbit CL and of
the stellar sphere CB, respectively, Galileo found h = 1.10 miles, which, to
be sure, would give a detectable effect, since a = 1°30'. But for Copernicans,
Galileo added, R is very much larger than 45,000r and, consequently, the
line BLE in practice coincides with DIH, h = 0, and the horizon in both the
Ptolemaic and the Copernican system split the heavenly sphere into appar­
ently equal halves. "Please tell me if you think Copernicus can be saved in
this way."
A few months after this private assistance to heliocentrism, Galileo
received a challenge to declare himself publicly. Johannes Kepler, then teach­
ing mathematics precariously at a Lutheran secondary school in Catholic
Austria, sent two copies of his new and mysterious Mysterium cosmographicum
to Italy via the music teacher in his school, Paul Homberg. Since Kepler had
not heard of "Galileus Galileus," whose redundant name later amused him,
Homberg must have picked Galileo as a worthy recipient of the Mystery;
or, better, Venice put Homberg in Galilee's path by its enlightened policy of
encouraging foreigners and even heretics like Homberg to study in Padua.6
The episode was important because Galileo, who seldom read contempo­
rary works in mathematics or philosophy unless given them or attacked in
them, probably would not have stumbled on Kepler's book on his own. He
was to take something from it that decisively influenced his thought.
Like many people who receive unexpected books, Galileo thanked the
author immediately so as not to have to comment in detail. He had had time
only to read the preface, he said, from which he gathered that congratulations
were in order, not to the writer, but to the reader, for "having acquired such a
lover of truth as an ally in the search for truth." Kepler had found some choice
things, which Galileo promised to study, "and that the more willingly since I
adopted Copernicus' opinion many [five or six?] years ago, and deduced from

it the causes of many natural effects doubtless inexplicable on the ordinary
hypothesis. I've written out many reasons for it and many responses to rea­
sons against it, which I have not dared to publish as I've been deterred by the
fate of our master Copernicus. For although he has gained immortal fame
among a few, he has been ridiculed and derided by countless others (for such
is the number of fools). I would venture to disclose my thoughts if there were
more like you; but as there are not, I will forbear."
Kepler tried to stiffen the backbone of his shy ally. "I was very pleased
to receive yours of 4 August, firstly because of friendship begun with an
Italian and secondly because of our agreement about Copernican cosmol­
ogy." Mathematicians everywhere (Kepler continued) side with Copernicus
and calculate according to his principles. If we all speak out together, people
ignorant of mathematics will have to take our word for it. "If I'm right, not
many good mathematicians in Europe will wish to differ from us; tanta vis
est veritas, such is the power of truth. If Italy is not a suitable place for publi­
cation, and if you encounter other difficulties, perhaps Germany will grant
us this freedom ... Have faith, Galileo, and go forth." To this pep talk, and
an appended request to make a certain astronomical observation in the
common cause, Galileo did not respond at all. There were good reasons for
his silence. To the practical Catholic Galileo, the rhapsodic Lutheran Kepler
was no closer to the truth in astronomy than he was in religion.
Kepler could be faulted not only for pretending to rethink the thoughts
of God, but also for having been a student of the detestable Michael Mästlin,
professor in the Lutheran stronghold ofTübingen. The Index had condemned
all of Mästlin's books, which he richly deserved for his vicious pamphlet war
against good Father Clavius over the Gregorian reform of the calendar. Now
Mästlin's protégé, the author of the Mysterium cosmographicum, had set up as
a sort of prophet, indeed, as an answer to the Lord's prayer. "God Himself
has waited for 6,000 years for someone to study Him [properly]."? (Gali­
leo used much the same formulation when he set up as a prophet 15 years
later.) Kepler had demonstrated a profound harmony, and perhaps more,
between the sun, the fixed stars, and the intermediate space where the plan­
ets play, on the one hand, and God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit, on the other. This vision, though pale in comparison with Bru­
no's kaleidoscopic cosmology, nevertheless coincided with it in key points
that interested the Inquisition: the Copernican system, which, if taken liter­
ally, conflicted with Scripture, and the identification of the Trinity with the

114
GALILEO
Cosmos, which, if pursued logically, could end in pantheism." When Galileo
came out of the closet, some sharp-eyed commentators, including Kepler,
would perceive similarities between his worldview and Bruno's. It was not a
desirable connection.
The cosmic mystery Kepler claimed to have cracked was the puzzle why
God created only six planets and gave them the speeds and distances they
display in a Copernican universe. The clue to the right answer came to Kepler
during a lecture on an astrological theme and led to the exotic geometry of
the Platonic solids. Of these rare objects-each of which consists of the same
regular polygons meeting at the same solid angles-there can exist only five
even in the heaven of geometry. In an extraordinary feat of imagination,
Kepler saw these five solids nestled inside one another so that a spherical
shell inscribed in one would circumscribe another. The five solids therefore
defined six spherical shells, to each of which Kepler assigned a planet; Saturn
circulated in the shell circumscribing the cube, Jupiter in the shell inscribed
in the cube, and so on.
Kepler chose the order of the solids to get the best fit. Once established,
the sequence fixed the relative values of the mean distances of the planets
from the sun without wriggle room for the mathematician. To determine
the thickness of each shell, which represented the difference between the
maximum and minimum distances of the planet from the sun, Kepler
resorted to observation and left their derivation from fundamental prin­
ciples to another occasion. Still, he had seen to the heart of the cosmic
mystery. "Never could I express in words the joy that this discovery gave
me. I no longer regretted lost time. I no longer feIt disgust at the toil,
I no longer shirked the most laborious calculation, and I spent days and
nights computing until I could see if my opinion ... agreed with the orbits of
Copernicus or if my joy would dissipate in the winds."!'
Kepler must have been disappointed that Galileo did not mention the
great discovery of the Platonic spaces when indicating his reasons for prefer­
ring the Copernican theory. "From it I have found the causes of many natu­
ral effects that doubtless cannot be explained on the ordinary hypothesis."
Kepler supposed that Galileo had the tides in mind. This idea was not hard to
find. One of Kepler's correspondents had suggested winds, tides, and ocean
currents as phenomena favoring a moving earth and, as we know, Calileo's
colleague at Pisa, Andrea Cesalpino, had proposed earth shakes as the cause
of tides." Sarpi's notebook for 1591 has a similar but subtler tidal generator

GALILEAN SCIENCE
115
in the small excursions of the earth's center of gravity from the center of the
universe occasioned by evaporation and precipitation, the descent of rivers
to the sea, rock slides, and so on. Four years later he noted that tides might
be caused by the combination of the diurnal and annual motions supposed
by Copernicus."
The theory Sarpi then sketched invokes the same principles that Galileo
later made the foundation of his proof of the Copernican system. Sarpi
observed that the two ends of a long seabed running east-west (think of
the Mediterranean) would have different velocities, as indicated in Figure 4.2.
The plane of the paper is that of the celestial equator; A and B are points in
space with which the ends P, Q of the semicircular canal PQ coincide when
we begin to watch; CD is the direction of the earth's revolution around the
sun projected onto the equator; and the arrow at C is the sense of the earth's
spin. The velocities of spin and revolution reinforce at A and oppose at B.
The canal around P must therefore decelerate, and that around Q accelerate,
during the twelve hours in which the spin moves the canal to the opposite
side of the earth and the annual revolution brings the earth's center from C
to D. This alternate acceleration and retardation creates tides because the
water, unable to keep pace with the acceleration of its bed, heaps up where
the canal slows down and falls away where the canal speeds up. Since, how­
ever, in real life the sloshing depends on the size, depth, and location of the
seas, the theory cannot predict the timing of the tides observed. The ques­
tion whether this fateful and fallacious theory was Sarpi's or Calileo's has
been answered variously." whoever deserves the credit, the theory contains

116
GALILEO
an idea basic to Calileo's later physics: the concept of the composition of
velocities, the ability of the same body to enjoy two different natural motions
at the same time.
The insight that the tides have nothing to do with the moon may have
sealed Galilee's commitment to the Copernican theory. His idea of "neutral
motion" in "De motu antiquiora" and his deduction that a marble sphere
centered on the center of the world could spin forever "naturally" had made
the diurnal motion physically possible; the derivation of the tides reported by
Sarpi now seemed to make the annual motion necessary. Hence by the time
he wrote Kepler in 1597, Galileo was a Copernican of at least two years' stand­
ing." Kepler would have preferred an ally who relied on solid metaphysical
rather than dodgy physical arguments; as he rightly observed, no theory of
the tides that omitted the moon could correspond to the nature of things."
But the theory reported by Sarpi corresponded perfectly to the nature of
Galileo. It was witty and economical, requiring only motions presupposed
for other reasons, and purely kinematical, eschewing ad-hoc, unintelligible,
spooky influences of the moon upon the waters. And, also characteristic of
many of Galileo's simplifications, it was wrong.
The single subject that took Calileo's fancy as he glanced through Kepler's
Mystery came at its end, where Kepler made a preliminary guess at God's
scheme for relating the periods r of the planets to their distances a from the
sun as determined by the Platonic solids. The guess failed quantitatively and
also, in Galileo's view, qualitatively. Kepler related the periods to the pres­
ence and activity of the sun." That was to introduce too much physics, or
the wrong physics, for Galileo. His first try at relating r and a invoked what
we may call the Pisan Drop in memory of Borro and Buonamici's theorizing
by throwing heavy objects from upper-storey windows. The Pisan Drop has
God release the planets from a point in the firmament whose whereabouts a
good mathematician could discover on the assumption that the linear veloc­
ity of a planet in its orbit equals the vertical velocity v acquired in its fall.
Calileo's calculation has very considerable interest if only for showing that
astronomical problems intruded into, and may perhaps occasionally have
guided, important developments in his ideas about motion. We saw another
likely example in the spinning marble sphere at the earth's center, which
could represent a Copernican problem or a misplaced grindstone." Here,
however, the connection is clear. Galileo knew that v is twice the average
velocity acquired during the fall, from which he gathered that if the time

GALILEAN SCIENCE
117
of fall equaled the period L, the orbit's circumference would be twice the
distance of fall."
Let Saturn be the reference orbit and bs its height of fall. Can Jupiter's
observed period LJ be obtained by a drop from the same creation point, that
is, through a distance bJ = bs + (as - a? Galileo arranged the calculation to
minimize reliance on the relatively unknown radii a. Since vJ LJ: Vs L s = aJ:as'
(bJ:bs)(LJ:LS) = aJ: as provided that, as Galileo then believed, velocity increases
with distance fallen in natural descent. And since bs = nas' LJ:LS = naJ:br If Gali­
leo had solved this equation for aJ taking as as known, he would have learned
that it did not come close to the Copernican value. In the calculation as pre­
served, he proceeded by successive approximations, altering aJ and bJ so as to
come as near as he thought necessary to the observed value of Lr That gave
him some confidence in the Pisan Drop, to which he would return again
and again, as an indication that the motions of rocks and planets follow the
same rules."
Galileo's first pursuit of a relation between L and a probably dates from
1602/3, if not earlier. The dating rests on letters from Edmund Bruce, like
Segeth a Scot in Pinelli's circle, to Kepler, whose cosmology Bruce much
admired. Bruce squealed that Galileo taught secrets from the Mystery as if
they were his own. It is charitable to suppose that Bruce had in mind Gali­
leo's attempt to implement the Pisan Drop, inspired by Kepler but not stolen
from him. Bruce's charge did not bother Kepler."
Infrequent communion
Kepler sent a copy of his Mystery to Tycho Brahe, then the prince of Euro­
pean astronomers, at his island research headquarters off the coast of Jut­
land. Brahe was not there to receive it. A new Danish king had decided that
an astronomical price was too much to pay for an astronomer and Tycho
received the unknown Kepler's little book while on the road looking for a
wealthier despot. Tycho replied that the trick with the solids was impressive
and the fit with Copernican data better than might be expected; and also that
Kepler's enterprise was fatally flawed by assuming a sun-centered universe
and relying on Copernicus' data. Tycho had a cure for both evils. In the true
world system, as Tycho conceived it, the earth remains at rest in the center
in accordance with good philosophy and common sense, the moon and sun
and stars revolve around the earth, and all the planets circle the sun. As for

118
GALILEO
data, Tycho had a castleful, collected by himself and his assistants or serfs
in the first continuous systematic planetary observations ever undertaken."
Hoping to get his hands on data that could confirm God's deployment of the
five solids and fix the widths of the spherical shells, and finding Graz increas­
ingly inhospitable to Protestants, Kepler negotiated for a job with Tycho, then
newly re-employed as mathematician to the eccentric Holy Roman Emperor,
Rudolf II. Tycho foresaw that the brilliant intense mathematician who could
think like God would be able to perfect the Tychonic system. The union was
not made in heaven, however, since Kepler had his own agenda and Tycho
would not allow him free access to the precious data. The mathematician's
star proved the stronger. In 1601, after two years of uneasy collaboration,
Tycho died. Kepler eventually got the data and also Tycho's post as Imperial
Mathematician."
Tycho had a mixed reputation in Padua around 1600. Pinelli had corre­
sponded with him, owned his books, and understood his claims to glory;
but as Tycho became more interested in promoting himself than his science,
Pinelli increasingly doubted his reliability. As part of the promotion Tycho
sent his student and son-in-law Franz Tengnagel to Italy to try to win the
financial support of the Venetian Senate and the Grand Duke of Tuscany for
an observatory in Egypt to extend Tycho's catalogue of stars southward. The
cause did not carry. Nor did the Tychonic system win many friends in Italy
since the Jesuits, particularly Clavius, opposed it." Against this background,
Tycho tried to get in touch with Galileo. Pinelli urged Galileo to reply; Gali­
leo preferred silence. In 1600 Tycho tried again through Pinelli. "Please give
my greetings to your most excellent professor Galileo Galilei on the grounds
of our common subject of study, and tell him that if he writes me ... he will
not find me slow to respond.'?' Silence again.
Tycho stooped to writing directly. The occasion, he said, was a conversa­
tion in which the ambassador of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to the Holy
Roman Empire sang Galilee's praises. "I could not help but write you to build
a basis for friendship and further correspondence." Then came a more plau­
sible reason:
1 learned from my assistant Franz Tengnagel on his return from Padua
that you have examined the first volume of my Epistolae astronomicae
[1596] and found some things in it about which you wished to consult
me ... [I]f there is something that you want to discuss, 1 welcome it, and

GALILEAN SCIENCE
119
you will find me a most faithful correspondent. Perhaps it concerns my
hypothesis of the celestial revolutions ... ; there are some details that
neither the Ptolemaic nor the Copernican system can handle so well.
Perhaps you want to discuss fixed stars, or comets ... , or something else
mentioned in my book. Do it frankly, as you judge best. I in turn will
tell you my opinion and not neglect to confer with you about astro­
nomical matters."
Certainly a civil letter.
Why Tycho wanted Galilee's correspondence is not known for certain. At
the time he sought a biographer in Italy and at all times he strove to control
the field by collecting astronomical observations. Possibly he was misin­
formed by Kepler, who inferred from Calileo's endorsement of Copernicus
and his station as a mathematician that he actively pursued astronomical
research. Whatever Tycho had in mind, it failed. Galileo could not have liked
what he read in Tycho's Epistolae astronomicae against Copernicus and had no
interest in setting the heretic right. He did not answer Tycho's civil letter,"
Nevertheless, he carried on a private debate with Tycho that sometimes
spilled over into caustic references in freewheeling discussions with his
Paduan friends. Perhaps he laughed at Tycho's compulsion to collect data:
"it is no demerit for a mathematician not to have seen the star at its first
appearance, as if he were obliged to stay up all night for his entire life staring
at the heavens to see if he can spot a new star.'?" Or, he might have depre­
ciated Tycho's planetary system for its bad taste, its awkward compromise
of Ptolemy and Copernicus. These or similar belittlements came to the ears
of Tengnagel through the generosity of Galileo's rival Magini. ''I'll not dig­
nify these emulators and calumniators of Tycho," Tengnagel replied, "these
dwarfs who rant in private and from the lectern in Padua against whomever
they please," by mentioning them in connection with Tycho's glorious name.
"The truth cannot be expressed or repressed by owls hidden in the shadows
(I mean those proto-mathematicians, that celebrated, if it please God, profes­
sor of mathematics and his Venetian brother in ignorance [Sarpi? Sagredo?]).
Being incapable of publishing anything on their own, they envy the immor­
tal, super-Herculean labors of others.'?" Galileo had not published anything
because he had nothing to say that could withstand his own criticism.
It took nature itself to force Galileo into broadcasting, if not printing,
some of his unripe cosmological opinions. The cause was public interest

120
GALILEO
in the nova of 1604, first noticed in Padua, on roth October, by Capra and
two associates. Capra told his patron Cornaro, who told his protégé Galileo,
who caught up with the spectacle on the rsth. The university turned to its
mathematician for an explanation. The three lectures Galileo devoted to the
nova in November and/or December drew large audiences eager to know its
importance for philosophy and astrology. "Grave questions, these," said the
professor, "and worthy of your minds. If only I could give answers that cor­
responded to the importance of the matter and your expectations ... ! I will
take up only a single point, which pertains to my particular competence, the
evidence for its motion and its position.'?"
Galileo explained the meaning and relevance of parallax, reported that
the nova displayed none, and concluded, as a certainty, that it lay beyond
the moon. Here he might have stopped, having dispatched his single arrow.
Instead he sketched a theory that ruined the Aristotelian cosmos: the nova
very probably consisted of a large quantity of airy material that issued from
the earth and shone by reflected sunlight, like Aristotelian comets. Unlike
them, however, it could rise beyond the moon. It not only brought change
to the heavens, but did so provocatively by importing corruptible earthy
elements into the pure quintessence. That raised heaven-shattering possi­
bilities. The interstellar space might be filled with something similar to our
atmosphere, as in the physics of the Stoics, to which Tycho had referred in
his lengthy account of the nova of 1572. And if the material of the firmament
resembled that of bodies here below, a theory of motion built on experience
with objects within our reach might apply also to the celestial regions. "But I
am not so bold as to think that things cannot take place differently from the
way I have specified.'?'
The nova took 18 months to fade away. Galileo observed its protracted
death in the hope of detecting a constantly diminishing parallax. If the nova
rose from the earth into regions beyond the moon, perseverance in its origi­
nal direction might plausibly be the cause of its dwindling intensity. Suppose,
then, that the nova began to fade when not far past Saturn and that it moved
steadily on along a line that passed through the earth's center. Its changing
parallax might be discoverable if the universe were Copernican. The maxi­
mum distance measurable by sightings from two stations depends on their
separation. That is the principle of binocular vision. For Ptolemaic observ­
ers, the maximum possible separation of the stations is the earth's diameter;
for Copernican observers, it is the diameter of the earth's orbit (Figure 4.3).

Nevertheless, the nova refused to show parallax. Perhaps failure to detect the
parallax undercut Galileo's confidence in the Copernican theory."
The menacing question whether a mere measurement could kill established
physics again featured high on the philosophical agenda. The several solutions
suggested by friends and opponents of Galileo will indicate the ingenuity,
alarm, and wishful thinking that the recent nova inspired among the commit­
ted learned. Clavius belonged to the wishful. He accepted that parallax meas­
urements placed the recent nova beyond the moon, just as Tycho's numbers
did the nova of 1572; but after watching the sky he buried his head in the sand,
and declined to be drawn on the physical consequences of the placement."
Guidobaldo del Monte doubted the observations that established the null par­
allax and made some himself, with little luck; however, he would not have his
brother mathematicians pollute the immaculate heavens and walk away from
their dirty work. "The mathematicians will soon agree among themselves that
it is a star. But they will not know how to reply to the philosophers' demon­
strations that the heavens do not corrupt and cannot suffer this novelty ... It
is against all philosophy ... I cannot understand why knowledgeable people
want to make the heavens corruptible in order to be able to pronounce the
nova a star.'?' Del Monte too thought wishfully. "[The nova] does not bother
me for I believe it is a comet," and hence, for an Aristotelian, quarantined
beneath the moon. He recalled that Mazzoni knew so much about comets
that he had managed to persuade the Grand Duchess Christina that she had
nothing to fear from them. "Would that Mazzoni were still alive!"35

122
GALILEO
A nest of mathematical philosophers in Verona accepted that the new star
lived beyond the moon and offered various solutions to the implied prob­
lem in physics. Ilario Altobello, who was a Minorite monk and a minor poet
as well as a mathematician, wanted to cause the maximum damage. Noting
that the nova first appeared near and during a conjunction of Saturn and
Jupiter, he supposed it an offspring of their union, "a most marvelous marvel
of the heavens, given as the last light in this last of the penultimate age of
the world, to make us understand the contrivances and truths of celestial
nature." Owing to its placement relative to Jupiter and Mercury, the star
would expose the truth, which is that the world is Tychonic." Other cor­
respondents from Verona ascribed the nova to sunlight reflected from rela­
tively dense quintessence created either by chance overlap of denser parts
or by compression of rarer parts by Jupiter and Saturn." The authoritative
Kepler denied that the nova owed anything to the grand conjunction, or
Europe's problems anything to its fading, but to say the truth there was no
reason to believe him."
Among the purer philosophers, two have a claim on our attention as
Galileo replied to one, Antonio Lorenzini, and had a running battle with
the other, Ludovico delle Colombe. Lorenzini was a freelance, the author
of a philosophy of laughter chuckled over as far away as Germany, and a
friend of Cremonini, who probably contributed the more telling passages
in Lorenzini's assessment of the nature of the nova. Padua's primary phi­
losopher had taken pains to observe the "exhibition in the sky made to drive
peripatetics crazy," and rebuked through Lorenzini mathematical cobblers
who did not stick to their last. Galileo's well-attended performances had
trespassed beyond the disciplinary boundaries regulating public lectures
and, with the authority of the podium, had planted doubt about the general
reliability of the received world picture. And that on the basis of a number
or two obtained from instruments operated at or beyond their limits of reli­
ability! Philosophers drew their conclusions from the "principles of natural
things known through the senses, observed at an appropriate distance, and
confirmed by induction," whereas mathematicians were literally out of their
senses as the things perceived lay very far away."
The argument has its merits. To defeat it Newton would posit a special
"rule for philosophizing," which requires that qualities we find in all the
bodies we can experiment with, like extension and impenetrability, should
be taken as qualities of all bodies universally." Cremonini would have added,

GALILEAN SCIENCE
123
provided that the extension does not upset the physics we have developed
from experience with objects we can handle. From this point of view, aban­
doning Aristotle, not cleaving to him, would have been irrational." Lorenzini
did not pursue the argument at this level, however, but tried to discredit par­
allax measurements on technical grounds that he did not understand. That
opened him to easy dismissal by astronomers. Capra replied immediately,
with an annoying boast that he had seen the nova five days before Galileo.
The gadfly thus stung the professor on his most sensitive spot, his private
and professional honor. The consequent grudge, amplified by the plagiarism
of the compass, precipitated Galilee's intemperate attack on Capra men­
tioned earlier.
A Latin edition of Lorenzini's Discorso fell into Kepler's hands. He read it
as an affront to astronomy. "What do you say to [this fellow], Italian math­
ematicians, you Clavius, Guidobaldo, Magini, Galileo ... ? Why do you shut
your eyes and show such patience before something so dishonorablei"'"
When he received this call to arms, printed in Kepler's account of the nova,
Galileo had already taken steps to level Lorenzini in a way, however, that
Kepler would not have understood. Galileo hid behind others, a feint foreign
to Kepler, who was candid to a fault. And instead of writing a serious reply
in Latin or Italian, which might have served as a purgative to scholars who
had swallowed Lorenzini, Galileo and his collaborators wrote a lampoon in
the unintelligible dialect of the Paduan countryside.
Galileo and his friends did not take Cremonini-Lorenzini as seriously as
Kepler did. They laughed at the philosopher of laughter." The mockery did
not bother Cremonini, who had learned not to get upset when opposed. "Dis­
agreement about learned matters does not make enemies of honorable men,
rather, it is a sign of great ignorance to dislike people who do not accept your
opinion.':" Historians sometimes miss this point. Like his diatribe against
wearing academic gowns, Calileo's put-down of Cremonini-Lorenzini was
a farcical exercise in a popular comic form, in this case the rustic dialogue of
the sixteenth-century writer known as Ruzzante. Galileo guffawed at Ruz­
zante's earthy humor and the rough expressive dialect of his characters, and
later kept his Florentine friends rollicking with his readings in Padovan."
The collaborators took the corporative name Cecco di Ronchitti, who
claimed to be from a village in the domain of Querenghi, and to have learned
about the nova from his master. In addition to Querenghi, Castelli's Benedic­
tine brother Spinelli and probably Castelli himself, who was a great fan of

124
GALILEO
Ruzzante, had their hands in the composition." Galileo apparently devised
the story line and Spinelli wrote it up. It stars one Natale (Nale), who knew
Lorenzini's opinions, and Matteo, who knew Galileo's. After Cecco insinu­
ates in Bernesque fashion that a gown makes a doctor, his bumpkins are dis­
covered under a walnut tree pondering the cause of the drought that afflicts
them. Nale confides that a doctor in Padua traced it to the new star.
Mat: "A pox on those great turds at Padua." Anyway, it's so far away
they cannot know where it is.
Nale: A philosopher there says it's much closer.
Mat: "A philosopher is he? What has philosophy to do with meas­
uring ... ? It's the mathematician you've got to believe. They
are surveyors of empty air, just like I survey fields."
Nale: The philosopher says that mathematicians do not under­
stand the problem, that they think the sky can be created and
destroyed.
Mat: "Now, where do mathematicians talk that kind of reasons? If
they just stick to measuring, what do they care whether or not
something can be created? If it was made of polenta, couldn't
they still see it?
Nonetheless, just like Galileo, Matteo speculates about the star's nature and
settles on Calileo's theory as the best available. Having turned philosopher,
he has a go at Aristotle:
Mat: "I think that in the sky there are hot and cold, wet and dry, just
like down here. Why? Thick and thin are seen there, and so
are light and dark. Those are contrary things. What more do
you want? That star could have been there but it wasn't, and
now all of a sudden it is. Isn't that a switch?"
Nale: "But he goes on to say that if earth and air and water and fire
were up in the sky, we could not see it the way we do, because
it would be thick and dark ... Also he says that [if made of the
four elements] the sky couldn't go around because the ele­
ments go up or down, but not around."
Mat: "He leaves out writers who say that the earth goes around like
a mill ... Plague take me if that fellow, Doctor though he is,
wouldn't look the same as anyone else with his clothes off."

GALILEAN SCIENCE
125
Nat: "Llisten to this one. He says that the mathematicians have
some good instruments and solid arguments, but just don't
know how to use them."
Our rustics have now come to the point. Matteo the surveyor explains how
to measure parallax and that, despite the cavils of the doctors, astronomers
could find it accurately enough to know whether an object is under the
moon or beyond it. Matteo then runs Nale around the countryside sighting
trees from various uncomfortable positions to teach him and any "learned
dwarfs" who could read Padovan the practical meaning of parallax and its
determination.
Nale: "I've got it, and it is as plain as a cowshed." Now here's another
thing-the author of this precious book says that unless it is
at the zenith, the moon cannot cover all of the sun.
Mat: "The Hell you say! The idiot must think that the moon is like
an omelette. What an ass! ... Is there more?"
Nat: "Sure. What's the meaning of 'gralaxy'?"47
Cecco's farce had a second printing later in 1605 significantly different from
the first in the two places in which Matteo alludes to Copernicus. The allu­
sions in the earlier edition, printed in Padua, are friendly: "there's a lot of
people, and good ones too, that believe the sky doesn't move"; "he [Loren­
zini] leaves out writers who say the earth goes around as a mill." The later
edition, printed in Verona, refers to "the lie that the sky didn't move" and
the "false witness" of the Pythagoreans and Copernicans, and dismisses the
writers who suppose the earth to spin as "wild-eyed." Although Galileo must
have been disappointed that after losing half its brilliance, and when seen
from opposite ends of a diameter of the earth's orbit, the nova showed no
change in parallax, it is unlikely that he authorized the changes."
Early in 1606 a more formidable opponent than Lorenzini entered the
lists. It was Ludovico delle Colombe, a Florentine of about Galilee's age,
who, having accepted the mathematicians' location of the nova, undertook
to place it in the heaven of the philosophers. On principle it could not be
newly created, but only newly visible. Assume then that it is at so great a
distance as to be invisible without the sort of lens that extends the vision of
myopic people. We need only to find a lens that we can all use at once. Delle
Colombe spied it in the transparent heaven whose slow turning causes the

126
GALILEO
precession of the equinoxes. A thickening in this heaven coming between
the viewer and the otherwise invisible star might reveal it, without doing any
violence to philosophy, theology, or astronomy." One Alimberto Mauri, of
whom nothing is known, replied to delle Colombe point by point. Perhaps
Mauri was partly or wholly Galileo. In support of the identification, Mauri
often throws numbers at delle Colombe (distances and sizes of stars, rates
of precession and other processes), puts the terrestrial elements in the sky,
and refers occasionally to Cecco." Against the identification are Mauri's dull­
ness and, what would have been foolhardy on Galileo's part during the great
Venetian interdict, the dedication of the book to Paul V's treasurer, Luigi Cap­
poni." Delle Colombe, who wanted to know his antagonist, at first identified
Galileo as both Cecco and Mauri, but soon accepted that he was only Cecco.
On this understanding he wrote most civilly to Galileo, whom he held in
honor and affection, he said, and was most eager to serve." But not for long.
Ludovico and his brother Raffaelo, a Dominican preacher, would make seri­
ous trouble for Galileo in Florence even before he returned home in 1610.
4.2 MOVER AND SHAKER
An uncertain trajectory
Galileo did not date his manuscripts or, usually, indicate what problems they
concerned, and if he published the results recorded in them, he did so dec­
ades after obtaining them. These sloppy habits vex and inspire the serious
student of his mathematics of motion. Since the 1970S, when Stillman Drake
proposed an ordering of the manuscripts based on watermarks, inks, and
orthography, the problem of what Galileo knew and when he knew it has
become deeper and darker. No single ordering uniquely makes logical and
chronological sense." What has been gained is an appreciation of Galileo's
skill as an experimenter. The manuscripts contain many numbers and some
diagrams that suggest the experimental arrangements that produced them:
pendulums, inclined planes, water clocks, free drops. Several modern Gali­
leians have repeated these experiments and, after much eut and try, have
reproduced the numbers. 54 Their success has only enlarged the domain of
mystery.
Did experiment drive theory or theory experiment? Sometimes the one
and sometimes the other, but also, and not rarely, neither. Galileo could stick

GALILEAN SCIENCE
127
to an attractive theory in the face of overwhelming experimental refutation.
During his period of greatest creativity in the science of motion, from 1602
to 1609, he probably jumped from theory to experiment and from one idea
to another, circled back and forth, inventing the form of a descriptive math­
ematical physics, guided often enough by little more than his buon gusto. The
principal outcome was a somber, limited, exact science, and a few striking
results, advertised as more exact than they were, to serve as a replacement for
one chapter of the vast, colorful, diffuse library of Aristotelian philosophy.
Calileo's exegetes have thought this dating game worth the candle for
several reasons. Drake thought it important to show that hard-headed
experiment and calculation preceded the theories on which modern phys­
ics stands. In his reading, the practical man, not the philosopher, was the
proto-scientist. 55 For others, knowledge of the pathway to discovery, with
its jumps forward, backward, and sideways, is of surpassing interest, both
in its details and in its indications of the modes of human creativity." Still
others want to know how Galileo's ideas related to Aristotelian commentary,
medieval geometry, and practical mechanics." Here the vast potential field
is narrowed appreciably by the content of Calileo's "De motu antiquiora,"
which framed his work in Padua.
While at Padua, Galileo had several interlocutors who played the roles that
Mazzoni had played at Pisa: sounding board, source of ideas, and, perhaps
most important, propounder of problems. One of the interlocutors, the late
Moletti, communicated through his manuscripts, which Galileo consulted in
Pinelli's library; in them Galileo would have found or confirmed such essen­
tial ideas of his mechanics as the composition of velocities and the retarda­
tion of descent along inclined planes." Guidobaldo del Monte's notebooks
also contain considerations very close to ones Galileo later published as his
own. Some historians read these considerations as records of conversations
with Galileo." It is safer to attribute them to "Calileo's group," a set of friends
with whom he discussed all sorts of things freely and openly, and to regard
them, as the group seems to have done, as common property. Sarpi did not
name Galileo in his notebooks and Galileo did not credit Sarpi with any
of the Galileian ideas found in them." Galileo thought that Mazzoni had
derived much of his treatment of Aristotle's failings from their exchanges
during walks around Pisa, but Mazzoni did not think an acknowledgement
necessary. Del Monte did not mention Galileo when describing ideas very
similar to ones Galileo later used as if his own. Nor, to be fussy, did Galileo

128
GALILEO
claim to be the author of the main new ideas about motion presented in
his published work. He remains fastidiously off stage while his spokesman
describes inventions revealed in conversation with him. "Our academi­
cian told me that he has found out ... " Even in this form, the claim is about
knowledge, not about priority.
By 1610, Galileo possessed virtually everything he later made public in the
Two new sciences (1638). He, Sarpi, and at least one or two others then knew
that in free fall bodies increase their distance from their starting point in
proportion to the square of the time elapsed, and their velocity as the time
linearly; that the trajectory of a body thrown or shot obliquely is a parabola;
that violent and natural motion can coexist in the same body from the onset
of the violence; and that an impressed velocity does not waste away of itself.
What seems essential to know is not who made what discoveries when, but
why Galileo came to see them as fundamentally important, as the basis of
a new science of motion. Why did he reject the questions about motion
as well as the answers given to them by Aristotle and his commentators,
among whom we should number Galileo's former self, the author of "De
motu antiquiora"?
To obtain an answer in this muddle of uncertain dates, perplexed attri­
butions, and reciprocal influences without claiming greater certainty than
our information allows, a Galileian dialogue, which permits digressions
and approximations, might suit." Its participants are Alexander, Galileo's
alter ego from Pisa, who since parting from Galileo in 1592 has cultivated
algebra, and Galileo himself. The conversation takes place during the
summer of 1609, when Galileo, according to his custom, was spending part
of his vacation in Tuscany.
An imaginary reconstruction
Al. What have you done with the subjects we talked about at such length in
the old days? You almost finished a formal discourse and drew it up in Latin
before you left, but you have not published a word.
Gal. The truth is, I've been working hard to make ends meet and attend to
three children and several clever friends. Actually, that's not the reason. The
truth is that I found serious difficulties in our dear old "De motu" and I have
not been able to solve them within the old framework.

GALILEAN SCIENCE
129
AI. If you can't solve them, no one can.
Gal. You recall that our Pisan mechanics turned on an extension of
Archimedes' treatment of floating bodies to falling ones. That led us to
discard levity, except when laughing at Aristotle, as unsuitable to science,
and let relative gravity, the tendency of all bodies to go to the center of the
universe, do all the work. Of course, as Aristotle dimly perceived, heavier
bodies possess this tendency more powerfully than light ones: but he erred
in measuring this tendency by gross weight rather than by weight per unit
volume, or density. With this important clarification, we agreed that, grosso
modo, the world is constructed with the heaviest, that is, the densest, matter
closest to the center, and the lightest, that is, the rarest, at the top, under the
sphere of the moon."
AI. Yes, we thought that this was a secure move away, but not far away, from
Aristotle, as the theory allowed bodies to come to their proper places with­
out suffering the impossibilities of motion that Aristotle put on them.
Gal. You mean his crotchet that in moving freely or naturally a body assumes
a velocity determined by its weight and the resistance of the medium through
which it falls. We had a good laugh at that and at his deduction from it that
vacuum cannot exist. Since then I've come to see that his desire to write the
medium into his theory responded to something profound. It is after all the
separation of a body from its natural place that somehow provides the cause
and occasion for it to move. Separation implies the existence of an interme­
diate entity or ground, since otherwise the current and future, or actual and
potential, positions of the body would coincide, which is absurd. Aristotle
went wrong in estimating the velocity of return to natural place by the ratio
of the weight of the mobile to the resistance of the medium.
AI. We showed that this relationship fails before experiment as well as logic, and
replaced it with the relation we derived from Archimedes: velocity of return is
proportional to the difference in densities of the mobile and the medium.
Gal. From that we easily showed that in a vacuum a body would move with
a finite speed proportional to its density. That annihilated Aristotle's argu­
ment against the void. However, his insight that something must provide the
separation between present and future positions of a moving body remains:
our "vacuum" is not nothingness, but a ground of unresisted motion.

130
GALILEO
Al. You are becoming very generous in your maturity. I sense that acquaintance
with your clever friends in the Veneto has blunted the know-it-all attitude that
endeared you to the faculty at Pisa.
Gal. Moderation and common sense lie deep in my character. Anyway, I
came to see that we did exactly what Aristotle did. We began from sound
principles but generalized prematurely. The reliance on Archimedes was
a mistake. His theory relates to static equilibrium; its generalization to
bodies moving continuously in natural motion is not obvious and may
not be possible."
Al. We generalized by adding the old concept of a self-consuming or wast­
ing impetus to explain why a body thrown vertically upwards gradually
slows, ceases to rise, and falls back faster and faster as the wasting impulse
dies away. If the body can fall far enough that the impetus wears off com­
pletely, it will proceed with a characteristic velocity proportional to the
difference in densities of the body and the medium. Until that point, it
appears to accelerate but in fact is just using up the impressed impetus.
As Aristotle perceived (to talk in your nice new way), the final or true
velocity in natural motion is a constant. The common view that natural
fall is accelerated is false." The hand or shelf holding an object before it
drops supplies the same amount of wasting impulse it would have retained
if thrown there from the surface or maybe the center of the earth. So in
this case too, acceleration is only the apparent result of the decay of the
imposed impulse. And to finish the main traits of the theory, in projected
or violent motion at an angle a to the horizon the onset of the downward
motion owing to gravity occurs variously depending on the value of o: At
one extreme, vertical projection (a = 90°), gravity does not kick in until
the wasting impulse has vanished; in horizontal projection (a = 0°) it starts
immediately; in between, it happens at times and places closer to the start­
ing point the smaller the value of a.
Gal. Your summary is admirable. Unfortunately, the theory is completely
wrong. We might have been able to guess that, since our results never agreed
with the few experiments we may have made. We had to invoke accidental
factors like friction to explain the disagreement.
Al. Yes, certainly, that's the way Aristotelian theory works. Measurements
may confirm it but not kill it.

GALILEAN SCIENCE
131
Gal. You do not have to make mathematics a murderer to see that the con­
cept of a wasting impulse dependent on the nature, position, and direction
of projection of a moving object is logically inconsistent. For we say, on the
one hand, that a body released from rest has a residual impulse that is used
up in the fall; and, on the other hand, that a body projected upward begins to
descend where and when its wasting impulse expires. In the first case gravity
begins to act immediately and acceleration occurs through the wasting of
the impetus; in the second case, gravity kicks in only at the top of the rise
and acceleration occurs through the action of gravity. I began to see that
wasting impulse was vapid and that natural motion truly is accelerated at the
same time that I recognized that, at least for projection away from the verti­
cal, natural motion downward begins as soon as the object-rock, cannon
ball, arrow-is released from its mover.
AI. When did you tumble to this?
Gal. On my first journey from Pisa to Padua I spent a few days with that
wonderfully wise and helpful man, Guidobaldo del Monte. Besides being a
good mathematician, he was the inspector of fortifications for Tuscany and
delighted in the flights of cannon balls. For him the question when natural
motion begins to act in shots inclined at various angles had practical impor­
tance. We happened to be discussing it while drinking wine in his garden
near a shed with a sloped roof. I may have mentioned the trick of slowing
natural motion with the help of an inclined plane. Perhaps it came to both
of us at the same time that a ball rolled upward along the sloped roof at an
angle to the horizontal would simulate a cannon shot in slow motion. We
did the experiment using an inked ball on a plane more convenient than the
shed roof. Let me draw it for you at a representative angle a (Figure 4.4). As
you see, the ball traced out a line resembling a parabola, hyperbola, or, as we

fancied, an upside-down version of the curve formed by a chain hanging
from two widely separated supports.
AI. How extraordinary! But why refer to the chain? Does that not reintroduce
the old confusion between the static and the dynamic?
Gal. Yes, but the analogy between the simultaneous actions of the stretch and
weight of the chain, on the one hand, and of violent and natural motions,
on the other, may give an opening to a solution to this important and prob­
lematic connection. The essential point is the symmetry of the path. As Gui­
dobaldo wrote in his account of the ball's trajectory, "it rises as it descends,
which is reasonable because the violence it acquired going up causes it to
behave similarly coming down, where the natural motion then dominates.
The violence that directed the motion from B to C is conserved, making
CD equal to Be, and, as it gradually lessens during the descent, makes the
path from 0 to E equal to BA. There is nothing to show that from C toward
E the violence vanished completely [afatto]. For although it diminishes con­
tinually toward E, yet enough remains that the ball never travels in a straight
line there.?"
AI. I see that you or both of you were still uncertain whether the violence
continues unabated or dies away in time.
Gal. The answer of course lies in the symmetry of the path. But it would be
after some years and extensive conversations with Sarpi that I realized that
the violent velocity must be conserved throughout, apart from the inevita­
ble loss in overcoming the resistance of the air. You see, what misled us was
that on the way up the slope of the curve initially follows the direction of
projection, more or less, over AB, whereas over DE the slope is reversed, as
if the impetus were running out and could no longer call the tune. Also, to
be frank, I've rather exaggerated the symmetry of the curves traced by the
inked ball. 66
AI. Very often pictures are misleading. I am too much of a gentleman to
point out that misleading ideas from geometry can be rendered harmless in
the course of algebraic abstraction.
Gal. There is something in that. I got into a dreadful muddle through what
appeared to be a very apposite drawing. It depicted the fall from A to B

GALILEAN SCIENCE
133
(Figure 4.5) and the muddle arose from supposing that in the acceleration
velocity increases as the distance fallen. Or, in geometric terms, VC: VB =
CG:B], where V C' VB are the degrees of velocity acquired in passing over AC,
AB. And I should add in partial exculpation that I also had vaguely in mind
that the distance a hammer can drive a nail at a single blow depends on the
hammer's velocity.
AI. I see Aristotle behind this formulation. He always took velocity as his
main measure of motion, in preference to, say, the time required to cover a
particular distance. Greek mathematicians had trouble with the concept of
velocity because, as a mixed ratio of distance and time, it did not have the
dignity of a Euclidean quantity. In my opinion, you will never create a satis­
factory dynamics of motion if you do not relax about these Greek demon­
strations. To pick one example: your concept of indifferent motion derived
from the relationship vh: vk = k:h, where hand k are the height and length
of the same inclined plane; and from this you concluded that on a plane of
zero slope a body would be indifferent to motion. But vk in this case is not
indifferent but indefinite because on a plane of zero slope k:h = 0:0.67 What
do you say?
Gal. I'll have to think it over. Meanwhile I'll continue the confession of my
embarrassment at how long this erroneous association of velocity and dis­
tance dominated my thinking. I've only freed myself from it during the last
year or two. Liberation came with my discovery that the path of a cannon
ball is in fact a parabola. In looking back I can see that I arrived at this

enlightenment by swinging back and forth between good and bad ideas and
better and better experiments.
AI. You always liked pendulums." But I must say that the use that doctors
have made of your pulse meter would not convince anyone that numbers
are relevant to reality.
Gal. During my last illness Santorio declared that my pulse rate made me a
hypochondriac of the 97th class. That contented him but not me. Doctors
should know and treat the causes, not the numbers, of diseases.
Ant. Perhaps we should keep that in mind. Have you had any success in prov­
ing your claim that a pendulum performs its oscillations in the same time
regardless of the amplitude of its swings?
Gal. No, but I've made a lot of progress in trying. Early on I tumbled to a rel­
evant and very beautiful proposition deducible from our old Pisan mechan­
ics: the time a ball takes to roll down a chord to the bottom of a vertical circle
is the same for every chord including the vertical diameter. It follows from the
rule that the velocities of descent along inclined planes of the same height are
inversely as their lengths. Let us draw (Figure 4.6). ADB is the vertical circle
centered at C. The very beautiful proposition ("VBP" for short) is that descent
from D to A takes as long as descent from B to A no matter where D lies on
the circle. To see this, extend CB and AD to their intersection at F. From the
rule from "De motu antiquiora," we know that VBA: VFA = FA:BA. We want to
show that tBA: tDA = 1. Well, tBA: tDA = (BA:AD)(vBA: vFJ = (BA:AD)(FA:BA); and,

if you remember your Euclid, you know that AD·AF = 2AC2 and, therefore,
that tBA = tDA• 69
AI. Very nice, very nice indeed. And I see how you might hope to get from
here to the isochronism of the pendulum by filling the arc with little chords
and trying to get the total time by Archimedean exhaustion.
Gal. I've managed only for two chords but the result is encouraging: the time
for the broken journey SI, lA (Figure 4.7) is always less than the direct one
SA, from which I infer that descent along the arc SA takes less time than any
other route from 5 to A and, further, that this minimum is the same for all
arcs."
AI. That is quite an extrapolation. Even if it is true in mathematics, I doubt
that you would ever be able to show it for real pendulums.
Gal. You must have been talking with Guidobaldo. I sent the chord theo­
rem (the VBP) to him seven years ago. He replied that he did not believe it
or the consequences I wanted to draw from it in favor of the isochronism
of pendulums. I told him that I had demonstrated the isochronism with
two pendulums of equal length swinging in widely dissimilar arcs, which
stayed synchronized through hundreds of oscillations. Perhaps I exagger­
ated. He could not duplicate the feat." Nor did he expect to be able to since
he thought as we did once that experiment could not confirm theoretical
results precisely because of inevitable and uncontrollable disturbances." I
am almost willing to return to this position myself. I have not been able to

exhaustion of motion along an arc of a
vertical circle.

GALILEO
confirm by experiment my elegant theorem of the isochronism of descent
along chords. It works well enough for real chords, that is planes, with slight
inclines but the time over these is about 15 percent more than the time along
planes close to the vertical."
AI. Maybe the VBP is wrong. In any case, your demonstration of it doesn't
hold up. You took the velocity of descent as constant, as we did in the old
motion theory. It is in fact accelerated, as you since conceded.
Gal. I can fix that up. The average velocity of descent along inclined planes
of the same height is half their final velocity, since, as I postulate, velocity
increases uniformly in natural motion; so everything goes through as before
with half velocities in place of whole ones. Consideration of average veloci­
ties also yields the nice useful result that the times of descent along inclined
planes of the same height are as the lengths of the planes. Let's give it a name,
say the average time theorem (ATT).
Al. Nonsense, the average velocity over DA cannot be equal to the average
velocity over FA.
Gal. Before you go too far, let me tell you a second beautiful result that fol­
lowed from the VBP and the ATT. The derivation is very easy. The ATT gives
tCA: tBA = CA:BA and tEA: tDA = EA:DA. The relationship I'm after, the ratio of
the time of fall from C to that from E, is then tCA: tEA = (CA:BA)(DA:EA) (tBA:
tDA) = (CA:BA)(DA:EA). A touch of the VBP removes the ratio of the times.
Al. I see that the next step, to express AD:BA in terms of CA and BA, is a
piece of cake. By Pythagoras, AB2 = 2a2 and AD2 = ED2 + AP = (a2 - x2) +
(a - X)2 = 2a(a - x) = 2aEA. So DA:BA = (EAjCA)1/2, and tCA: tEA = (CA:EA)lj2.
Hence, if you imagine the diagram reversed and the fall to begin at A, you
have AE:AC = (t AE: t AC)2.74
Gal. You did that more elegantly than I did.
AI. The result-that the distances fallen go as the squares of the times
elapsed-is refreshing. However, it appears to rest on your dodgy deriva­
tion of the VBP. You must do better if you are to persuade the Sarpis and del
Montes, let alone the philosophers.
Gal. I told Sarpi about the times-square rule and the pretty consequence
that the spaces passed over in equal times in free fall are as the odd

GALILEAN SCIENCE
137
numbers 1,3,5 ... He had already absorbed ideas similar to those in "De motu
antiquiora.?" Like you, he wanted a better principle than the VBP and the
ATT, which he said were just disconnected bits, like my odd-number rule. I
rose to the challenge-and fell on my face.
AI. Ah! You went back to the velocity-distance concept. I don't blame you.
It is so natural an assumption. As we observed earlier, the point of natural
motion is to overcome distance or, better, separation, and velocity measures
the effectiveness with which the process occurs.
Gal. This is what I wrote Sarpi:" "I suppose (and perhaps I'll be able to
demonstrate it) that the naturally falling body constantly increases its
velocity according as the distance increases from the point of depar­
ture ... that the degree of velocity ... at E is to the degree of velocity at 0
as EA is to DA ... " (Figure 4.5). Then I show that the sum of all the veloci­
ties with which the body passes through AD is to the sum with which it
passes AE as LlADH is to LlAEI, that is, as AD2:AP, which, of course, is
the same as DH2:EF.
AI: I do not see what significance to assign to the concept of "sum of all the
velocities."
Gal. The sum of the degrees or moments of velocity, that is, of all the lines
that can be drawn parallel to OH and EI. I blush to say that I took the concept
and the analysis from a medieval technique called the "latitude of forms."
That was not very clever of me since the scholastic philosophers were inter­
ested in making a picture, not in calculating the accidents, of motion. But I
had known the technique for a long time and seized upon it to answer Sarpi's
demand for a principle." The appearance of the square of the distance, or,
better, the square of the velocity in the formulation seemed promising; for if
you take "sum of velocities" proportional to the square of the "latitudes" CG,
OH ... , and also proportional to the distance fallen AC, AD ... , you have, with
s as distance and v as the velocity achieved over the distance, s oc v2• Now, as
I continued in my letter to Sarpi, velocities go inversely as times, so v oc s:t,
and s oc t2, as I claimed.
AI. This is worse than your error about average velocities in deriving the VBP.
You have made s proportional both to v and v2• Even Aristotle would not have
made such a blunder.

GALILEO
Gal. That's what Sarpi said too. Nonetheless, I confirmed the t2-rule by
experiment. I've rolled balls down inclined planes of small slopes and timed
their passage over measured distances with a water clock and by beating
time. I never would have found the rule by experiment, but the measure­
ments come close enough to the theory, and could be made closer if anyone
thought it worth the trouble."
AI. That would be a waste of time.
Gal. As for the principle Sarpi demanded, I found it at last, after twenty years'
study of motion. It is that in natural motion, not distance or velocity, but
time is the ordering principle. The axiom that I should have offered to Sarpi
is that in natural motion "velocity is proportional to the square root of the
distance fallen." This picture of velocity against distance is a parabola, not a
triangle." In fact, it was while playing with parabolas that I came to see the
truth.
AI. Before going there, I cannot help pointing out that the way you arrived at
your t2-rule should comfort philosophers who think that mathematics only
confuses physics. Just look at the range of conflicting assumptions you have
used to get the same result: v oc s, v oc -Vs, v oc t, "total velocity" proportional
to S2, natural motion both accelerated and unaccelerated, and so on. There
may be a thousand theoretical assumptions from which the t2-rule follows,
and each of these assumptions may imply a different causal mechanism and
so a different physics.
Gal. 50 what? Let us first obtain exact descriptions and then worry about
qualitative explanations if we still want them. In the process, we can elimi­
nate many possibilities, just as measurement of parallax has negated much
of Aristotle's physics.
AI. Although in that case measurement is used qualitatively, to show whether
an object is closer or further than the moon. The exact numbers do not
matter.
Gal. I'll tell you what I told Fra Paolo when he raised similar points about
experiments and causes. He objected to my conclusion from the symmetric
curve that Guidobaldo and I had studied that an object shot upward would
return to the point of projection with its original velocity reversed in direc­
tion. He remarked that an arrow that could pierce a board when shot at it

GALILEAN SCIENCE
139
directly at short range scarcely dents it when descending from the height
to which the bow propels it vertically. I replied that we cannot remove the
resistance of the air, which slows the arrow in both directions to an extent
we cannot calculate. I made the same observation to Guidobaldo when
explaining to him that, notwithstanding his troublesome experiments, my
chord theorem is too beautiful not to be true."
Al. So would you say that the jury is out on the value of experiment? Or is
the correct position that it is conclusive when it confirms a quantitative rule,
but only an inconvenience when it does not?
Gal. Perhaps something like that. Let's go on to causes. The inexhaustible Fra
Paolo asked me why objects of different material, like gold and silver (they
are the first things a Venetian thinks of), receive different amounts of impe­
tus from the same mover." The more I considered this question, the more
I convinced myself that it is not possible to say anything exact about it. From
then on, except for discussions with Sarpi, who likes hopeless causes, I have
not worried about such questions.
Al. This is to leave the field to the philosophers.
Gal. Judge after I've told you how I came to know that v oc -Ys and therefore that
v oc t and the tremendous discovery, indeed, my best discovery in mechan­
ics, that I made along the way." You know that I've had financial trouble
largely because of the incessant demands made on me by my-or should I
say our-siblings.
Al. And partly because of your self-indulgence.
Gal. I've supported these little indulgences and the family in large part by
teaching military engineering. Gunnery is an essential part of it. My busi­
ness and theoretical interests thus came together in the weighty matter of
the trajectory of cannon balls. Gunners don't care whether or not a useful
mathematics of trajectories rests on a solid philosophical foundation.
That made things simple. I could ignore the annoying relations among
experiment, mathematical theory, and explanatory causes that worry
philosophers.
Al. So you went directly to your workshop. How did you model gunshots at
various elevations?

140
GALILEO
Gal. I turned the problem upside down. I rolled balls down the plane GA
(whose slope I exaggerate in the drawing (Figure 4.8)) and turned their
velocities so that they leapt into space at A. I have an adjustable board that
can be placed at BE, CF ... I observed the places B, C ... where the ball struck
the board. The distance AE, AF ... always came out as the squares of the dis­
tances BE, CF ... , not like the thousand synchronic swings of the pendulums
through different arcs, which, to be sure, was rhetoric, but truly and neatly."
Now BEl oc AE is just the symptom of a parabola.
AI. That should interest bombardiers. They might see the connection with
your earlier formulations more easily if you were to use the double-distance
theorem that follows from the proposition that the average velocity of
descent is half the final. 84 If then you plot points horizontally at distances 2k,
4k, 6k ... and vertically below them points at pp, 4pk2, 9pP ... , P a constant,
and join the points you will have a parabola (Figure 4.9).
Gal. To get the parabola, I had to assume that the horizontal motion, the
motion of projection, and the motion of fall occur simultaneously and inde­
pendently." Here again Archimedes showed the way, with his method of
generating a spiral as the locus of a point that moves radially and tangentially
at the same time. I'm often surprised by the way that art anticipates nature.
Come to think of it, old Cesalpino used to point out that rain can be driven
violently by the wind as it continues to fall naturally." And my predecessor
Moletti had worked it out, as I've seen in his manuscripts. The concept of

mutual disturbance or struggle belongs on the same scrap heap as positive
levity and wasting impulse.
AI. I see how to get the t2-rule and its principle, v oc t. The horizontal spaces
2k, 4k ... , are proportional to t, the vertical spaces pP, 4pP ... , therefore, to t2•
And from v oc t, achieved at last with the help of heavy artillery, s oc t2 implies
v oc .Js. That the velocity of fall should be proportional to the square root of
the distance fallen does not appeal to most people's intuition.
Gal. That is the chief reason for mathematizing physics-to correct the mis­
leading intuitions arising from everyday experience.
AI. Where do you go from here?
Gal. Remember that we agreed that Copernicus' geometry of the solar system
is more plausible than its rivals? Since then I have become convinced that

142
GALILEO
he is almost certainly right and that, in consequence, no theory of motion
based on gravity toward the center of the universe can be right-with the
exception of an old crotchet of mine about the creation of the universe.
Al. That seems out of character. What is it?
Gal. An idea that came to me while leafing through Kepler's Cosmic Mystery. It
is that all the planets fell from one and the same creation point as far as they
needed to acquire the velocities we observe them to have. I tried out the idea
using v oc s, which, of course, did not get me far. With v oc ...Js, I can work out
a common drop point for Saturn and Jupiter, or for any other pair of planets,
and preliminary calculations suggest that one point may do for all."
Al. What else do you have for philosophers?
Gal. The composition of velocities and the idea of indifferent motion, which
may permit a spinning sphere to spin forever, equip anyone to defeat the
usual physical arguments against Copernicus. With the composition of
velocities, the persistence of indifferent motion, and the t2-ruIe, I can derive
the trajectories of cannon balls and contrive a Copernican theory of tides.
Naturally, that does not prove Copernicus right.
Al. Philosophers abhor a vacuum more than nature does. How can you hope
to defeat a physical theory or rather an entire physics without one to put in
its place?
Gal. As our friend Mazzoni used to preach, philosophers should test their
theories against quantitative arguments. I admit that this use of mathematics
as a sieve for removing crude ideas does not meet my ambitions. Mathema­
ticians should not merely enforce right thinking among philosophers, they
should initiate and guide it.
AI. Have you the firepower to begin such a program?
Gal. Not yet. I only have some charming rules about motion on inclined
planes and a theory of projectile paths that would never serve to aim a gun.
And my refutations of physical arguments against the Copernican system
are not compelling to those who do not incline toward or accept it already.
AI. What are you waiting for?
Gal. A gift from God.

Calculated Risks
5.1 STARRY MESSAGE
Florentine foreplay
On 12 May 1590, an hour after nightfall, Christina, Grand Duchess of Tuscany,
fulfilled the promise of her extravagant wedding and produced a son. Jupiter,
blazing in mid-heaven, "looked down from that sublime throne ... and poured
forth all the splendor of his profuse magnificence into the purest air." The recip­
ient of this wholesome radiation was Cosimo II, who, twenty years later, having
risen through Jovian influences and the death of his father to the rank of grand
duke, would add Galileo, the author of the preceding astrological effusion, to
his court.' When the prince approached the age of 12, Calileo's reliable advi­
sor at Pisa, Dr. Mercuriale, suggested to Christina and Ferdinando that Cosimo
should learn mathematics. Simultaneously the matchmaker advised Galileo to
perfect his military and geometrical compass.' The compass showed the way.
Several Florentine gentlemen, who had acquired one by gift or purchase, men­
tioned to Christina Calileo's desire to present a suitable example to Ferdinando
during a visit in the summer of 1605. Let him send it, Cristina replied, and when
he comes to Florence "he will be seen in accordance with his merits.'?
And so he was. Christina invited Galileo to the Medici villa in the cool hill
town of Pratolino, "with a good room, modest table, good bed, and warm
welcome." Like most Jovians, Cosimo did not excel at mathematics and
Galileo would have to return for several more summer tutorials. During and
between these visits, the Medici and the mathematician bonded. Ferdinando
helped to resolve some of Galilee's legal-financial problems and provided
143

144
GALILEO
enough black satin to make a respectable gown for the hefty lampooner of
the Pisan toga.' Galileo commissioned two compasses in silver to point the
royal road to computation and adopted the style, or mask, of an angling
courtier." "[I am] one of those most faithful and devoted servants, who think
it the grandest grace and glory to be born subjects." Nothing would please
this subject more than to spend his life teaching Cosimo's mathematics.
"Unfortunately, great intrigues and enterprises are not for me." To which the
savvy princeling replied, "either you dissimulated about knowing your own
worth or think that 1 do not recognize it.'?
Galileo used the implied intimacy to recommend his Paduan doctor, Acq­
uapendente, as successor to Mercuriale, who died late in 1606. The recom­
mendation incorporated an argument Galileo was to recycle on his own
behalf three years later. "Having acquired everything he can hope for here in
reputation and authority, and having reached an age unsuited to the daily toil
of caring for many friends and patrons, [Dr. Acquapendente] wants a little
quiet to conduct his life and finish his work. He needs nothing to fulfill his
ambition but the titles and degrees that others of his profession have obtained
but which he cannot have unless they are given by a great absolute prince."
Ferdinando had need of a doctor. As he sank into sickness, Christina took
charge of whatever she could, including Galileo. In the spring of 1608, in a fit
of fever and melancholy, he gave her an opportunity to measure his ambition
and vanity. He had intended to spend that summer in Pratolino by invitation
from their highnesses. He therefore rejected an invitation to reside instead in
Florence. Feeling snubbed, he declined to go at all. "I would serve my prince
even at the cost of my life," Galileo wrote the Tuscan state secretary Belisario
Vinta, but otherwise, as he had no business in Florence, he would not come.
Christina understood: "Tell Galileo that since he is the first and most prized
mathematician in all Christendom the Grand Duke and I want him to come
this summer even if it is inconvenient in order to instruct our son the prince
in mathematics ... " Galileo set out for Tuscany as soon as his doctor and his
health permitted travel."
The summer school had a newcomer that year, the prince's clever
close friend Giovanni Ciampoli. Like Galileo, Ciampoli came from an old
unwealthy Florentine family and gained entrée to higher society through
his confident, aggressive ability with words. He versified spontaneously
aided by a memory able to retain a sermon at a hearing. His important
patrons included Strozzi, who took him into his household and gave him

CALCULATED RISKS
145
an allowance, and the grand duke, who employed him even as a teenager
to versify for Medici events. Persuaded by Cosimo's coach to study Euclid,
Ciampoli quickly progressed to astronomy; when Galileo returned to Flor­
ence in 1610, Ciampoli assisted him in the observations of Jupiter's moons.'?
He knew how to please.
Ciampoli's friend Cosimo had more to worry about in the summer of
1608 than mathematics. The ailing Ferdinando decided to procure a wife for
him. He pitched on a 21-year old archduchess, Maria Maddalena of Austria,
a pious young lady given to hunting. Galileo did not neglect the opportunity
provided by his early knowledge of the betrothal. A great expert in imprese,
he suggested a theme for the party the Medici would throw to solemnize
and energize the marriage. The theme should be a universal one indicative
of the groom's "celestial piety." Galileo proposed a magnet (Cosimo) sup­
porting iron fragments (his subjects) with the motto he had suggested for
Ferdinando's lodestone, Vim facit amor. There was even more to the meta­
phor: since our globe is a giant magnet and Cosmo means world, "the very
noble metaphor of the spherical magnet could be understood as our great
Cosimo." A coin with this impresa on one side and Cosimo's effigy on the
other with the tag Magnus Magnes Cosmos would make a fine souvenir. The
magnet's mother did not like the idea, however, and Galileo put the connec­
tion Cosmos-Cosimo in the cupboard for another occasion."
The wedding of Maria and Cosimo rivaled the spectaculars staged for
Christina and Ferdinando 20 years before. Bardi, Strozzi, and, especially,
Cigoli, again played prominent parts and another of Galileo's friends,
Michelangelo Buonarroti, the grandnephew of the artist, wrote the comedy.
Christina also participated. With a deadly mixture of bossiness and incom­
petence, she vetoed parts of the intermezzi that Bardi and others thought
integral to their artistic integrity." The damage would have been difficult
to discern, however, after the week of intense partying that began with the
bride's arrival in Florence on 18 October 1608 proceeded by five companies
of cavalry and four of musketeers. On entering the city through an elaborate
triumphal arch designed by Cigoli, Maria Maddalena exchanged her army
for an escort of 52 noble youths carrying a baldachino under which she pro­
ceeded to the cathedral. There Cosimo beheld her for the first time and hap­
pily found her less plain than reported; nonetheless, her squat figure and
square face, inherited from the Habsburgs and the positions of Venus and
Libra in her geniture, would become more pronounced with time and child

GALILEO
bearing. But she was radiant as she entered the cathedral filled with light
and flowers, silk hangings, and little angels; and no doubt her satisfaction
was as great as her surprise when a cloud carrying a chorus of singing saints
descended over her as she knelt to pray.
The following day, a Sunday, brought a ball and a banquet, for which
artists created in sugar forty famous Florentine sculptures. The festivities
ended at seven in the morning. The following week witnessed, among much
else, Buonarroti's play and the intermezzi; a ballet executed by horses; and
a representation, on the Arno, of Jason's theft of the Golden Fleece. This
adventure featured Cosimo as Jason commanding an Argo filled with soldiers
and musicians, a true float. He wore gilded arms, a magnificently plumed
helmet, and a mantle of gold reaching to the ground. Amid fireworks and
dragons Cosimo, scarcely mobile under his weight of gold, carried off the
fleece and presented it to his bride. More usefully, he gave dowry money to
200 poor girls."
The party was too much for Ferdinando. He took to his bed. Would he
recover? A reliable answer involved inspection of his nativity. Christina asked
Galileo to work out which of two dates assigned to Ferdinand's birth was
correct. He obliged. "It seems to me [he wrote the anxious Duchess] much
more in conformity with the rules to believe that His Highness was born on
30 July 1549 than on 19 July 1548." Ferdinando would not face his "climac­
teric year" for some time. Therefore his current illness would not prove fatal.
Nonetheless, Ferdinando died." The erring astrologer lost no time in offer­
ing condolence and congratulations, and in subscribing himself his former
pupil's "most humble servant and vassal."
The vassal was not so humble as to hide what he wanted from his new lord.
"I've worked for twenty years, and those the best of my life, dribbling out at
everyone's request that little talent that God and my own efforts have given
me in my profession." Galileo needed leisure and quiet to finish three great
works he had in hand. He would not willingly leave Padua. "Still, the freedom
[there] is not enough, since I must spend hours every day, and often the best,
responding to the demands of one person or another. It is not customary to
enjoy a stipend without public service in a republic, however splendid and gen­
erous, because to get anything useful from the public you must satisfy it, and
not just one individual; and while I am capable of teaching and serving, no one
in the republic can exempt me from them and leave me my salary; and in sum,
I cannot hope for such an opportunity from anybody but from an absolute

CALCULATED RISKS
147
prince." Galileo understood that the prince might want something in
exchange. He would give it willingly, he said, provided he did not have to
suffer republican servitude to all comers. "I would not abhor service to a
prince or grand seigneur ... but rather desire and covet it.?"
Although several of Galileo's Florentine patrons worked on this project
during the spring of 1609, Cosimo was not yet willing to burden himself
with his old tutor." He already had enough authority figures to please and
battle with: his mother, his late father's ministers, and his wife. Nor, per­
haps, now that he had to pay the bills for his extravagant wedding, did he
want to increase the expenses of the court beyond the necessary new staff
to see to Maria, who required, besides the usual attendants of a princess,
her own cook, a Jesuit confessor, and a handful of huntsmen to see to her
horses and hounds. While awaiting more definite news, the hopeful vassal
continued to teach, run his boarding school, peddle his instruments, and
carryon an expanding correspondence that dealt with poetry as well as
mathematics. From Rome Margherita Sarrocchi, known for her learning
and her beauty, "and for a none too excessive puritanism," sought his advice
about her heroic poem Scanderbeide. He sent her some critical advice and
also copies of his old theorems on barycenters for her partner, his old friend
from Pisa, Luca Valerio. He revealed to one of the Medicis that projectiles
fired from the same place to the same height have the same time of flight
over level ground irrespective of their range." He had other things in stock
too, many marvelous things, "perhaps the greatest curiosities that so far
have been sought out by men," but he did not have time to tell anyone what
they were." Nor did he have time to go to Florence in the summer of 1609.
That was lucky for him.
The Dutch gadget
"In Italy there is nothing new except the arrival of that spyglass [occhiale] that
shows distant things, which I much admire for beauty of invention and level
of art; but as for use in war on land or sea, I think there is nothing in it."
This was Sarpi's considered opinion in the early summer of 1609 when he
had known for over six months of the claim of Dutch spectacle makers to a
gadget that made distant objects appear near." He had not believed it, partly
because he had thought of something similar in theory when young, but had
not followed it up "owing to the recalcitrance of matter," and partly because

148
GALILEO
he had deemed the report exaggerated, "as rumors usually become when
traveling.'?" Galileo reacted similarly. He did not see the possible importance
of the gadget for his flirtations with Florence or for his instrument business.
He made no recorded effort to reproduce the Dutch performance although
he dealt in spectacle lenses and kept a selection of them in his shop." Perhaps
Galileo and Fra Paolo discounted the rumor as just another in a long series
of stories about magnifying mirrors or lens-mirror combinations. Natural
magicians like della Porta taught that a perfect artisan could accomplish
wonders with optical setups like those installed at the ancient Lighthouse
of Alexandria, by which the curious could see from one end of the Mediter­
ranean to the other." But neither he nor any other modern magician had
explained how to do it.
Those who know how to read Scripture can find in it references to eve­
rything. Father Benito Arias Montana, who attended to the publication of
the polyglot bible sponsored by Phillip II of Spain, was perforce an expert
reader. In Luke 4:5, which reports that "the Devil, taking [Jesus] up into a
high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment
of time," he perceived a reference to "the perspective or optical art, which the
devil knows; as by the same art we make inspicilla, which bring very distant
objects very exactly before the eyes.'?' The text dates from 1575. No Christian
dared to develop the Devil's device for another three and thirty years. Then
several bold artificers in the low countries produced versions that magnified
by a factor of two or three. One came into Sarpi's hands in July 1609. Having
examined it, he could advise the Senate not to buy it from a traveling sales­
man who had offered it, together with its "secret," for 1,000 scudi. By then,
August 1609, the secret was out."
Sarpi's knowledge of optics gave him confidence that the gadget could
easily be bettered, and his knowledge of men assured him that Galileo was
the one for the job. Not that Galileo had any particular expertise in optical
theory beyond perspective; neither Sarpi nor Kepler thought that he under­
stood the principles of the instrument and Sagredo, who applied to him sev­
eral times for explanations, judged none of them satisfactory." Sarpi would
have expected Galileo to proceed as he had in improving Sagredo's magnet,
by clever convergent variations of known methods of cut-and-try; and, once
he had found the method, to work doggedly until he could produce a sale­
able instrument for his inventory of military accessories." To make things
easier, Sarpi informed Galileo that the gadget consisted of two lenses, one on

CALCULATED RISKS
149
either end of a tube four feet long. Perhaps Sarpi helped in initial explorations
as he certainly did in subsequent improvements. The Dutch gadget became
the Italian telescope through the efforts of "the mathematician [Galileo] and
others here [in Venice] not ignorant of these arts.'?'
By the end of August 1609, Galileo had a 9X (o-power) instrument, magni­
fying three times as much as the original gadget. Following his bent, Galileo
would have kept his secret and sold his version to a market already developed
by news of the Dutch invention. With his head start and compulsive industry,
he could have expected to stay ahead of his competitors for some time. He
chose another way, almost certainly counseled and directed by Sarpi. On 24
August Galileo wrote to Doge Donà to offer his invention gratis to the state:
Galileo Galilei, most humble servant of Your Serenity, constantly and
vigilantly alert not only to fulfill his duty as lecturer in mathematics
at the University of Padua, but also by some useful and noteworthy
discovery to provide an extraordinary benefit to Your Serenity, now
comes forth with a new artifice of a spyglass [occhiale] derived from
the most recondite speculations of perspective, which brings visible
objects so close to the eye, and presents them so large and distinct that,
for example, what is distant nine miles appears as if it were only a mile
away: a thing of inestimable value in all business and every undertaking
at sea or on land ... And therefore, thinking it being worthy of being
received, and judged as most useful, by you, he has decided to present it
to you and to leave it to you to determine whether and how this inven­
tion should be manufactured. And this the said Galilei presents with
every affection for Your Lordship as one of the fruits of the science that
he has professed at the university for 17 years, with the hope of being
able to offer you better ones in the future, if it pleases God and Your
Lordship that, in accordance with his desire, he spends the rest of his
life in Your Lordship's service."
The phrase about the theory of perspective betrays a concern to reassure
Venetian admirals and generals by rooting the novel contrivance in the soil
of science." The Republic accepted this precocious product of academic sci­
ence for military purposes and rewarded Galileo, perhaps by prearrange­
ment, by increasing his salary to 1000 scudi and granting him tenure for life.
That seems a reasonable recompense. If Galileo had marketed his spyglass as
effectively as he did his compass, it would have bought him 400 or 500 scudi

150
GALILEO
a year for as long as he controlled the market. The increase in salary and life
tenure provided the same sum forever with no expenditure of effort. Galileo
informed his brother-in-law that he had shelved his plan for repatriation and
would continue in Padua."
The Florentine agent in the Serenissima, Giovanni Bartoli, kept the Tuscan
court informed about the sensation caused by Cosimo's vassal in Venice.
With Sarpi's help, according to the gossip, Galileo had analyzed the gadget,
found the "secret," and offered his improvement to the state; in recompense,
the Senate had raised his salary to 1000 scudi, "with the obligation of remain­
ing in his lectureship permanently.'?' The day this report went out, Cosimo
asked Galileo for a duplicate of the instrument he had just given to the Vene­
tian state." The vassal could not oblige. He could neither sell the occhiale
nor tell how to make it, and had to construct a dozen for the Venetians; his
gift had made him a servant. Secretary of State Vinta asked Bartoli to seek
something that might satisfy Cosimo on the open market. Bartoli located a
Frenchman who claimed to sell instruments as good as Galileo's; but neither
through it nor any other gadget he examined could Bartoli keep a distant
object in view. "To my eye they do not show so many marvels."33 He would
have said the same about Galileo's version, which had an even smaller field of
view than less powerful gadgets. In instruments of Galileo's design, the field
diminishes as the magnification increases; at lOX, about 20, two-thirds the
size of the full moon; at 20X, no more than 14; at 30X, under 10.34
Around 1 December 1609, Galileo raised his best telescope, then of 20X,
to view the most conspicuous object in the night sky. The moon was four or
five days old when its pockmarked face came fuzzily into view: like lesser
beings, Cynthia, the lunar goddess, lost her smooth complexion on a closer
view." As the moon grew, Galileo could see less and less of it at a single
peek, since his field of view encompassed less than a quarter of a full moon.
From his partial views of the lunar surface, he made composite portraits of
Cynthia in several phases-portraits, impressions, not exact mappings. The
six that survive in wash drawings are spectacular works of creative imagina­
tion (Plate 5).36 They called on Galileo's knowledge of perspective, the joint
property of mathematicians and artists; on his own exercises in drawing and
water-coloring; on his keen eyesight and trained eye; and, perhaps, on his
addiction to Ariosto, who had described just such a moon as Galileo drew
when relating Astolfo's search for the wits of the half-cracked champions of
Charlemagne."

CALCULATED RISKS
151
Calileo's special preparation for lunar viewing may be suggested by the
moon map drawn by the English mathematician Thomas Harriot shortly
before Galileo turned his telescope on what he interpreted as its mountains.
As a mathematician both pure and applied Harriot was Calileo's superior. If
he had published his discoveries and theories instead of leaving them scat­
tered through 10,000 pages of manuscript, he would have driven Galileo
crazy, for he anticipated much of Galileo's mechanics, including parabolic
trajectories, and explored the heavens almost as fruitfully as Galileo did.
With instruments of 6x and perhaps as much as lOX, Harriot saw enough
of the moon to map it in the style of a surveyor, a meager thing without a
hint of landscape (Figure 5.1a). One of his collaborators, Sir William Lower,
viewing independently, remarked that the terminator looked like a coastline
and the full moon like a meat pie; neither of them recognized the smudges
as shadows cast by craters. 38 After reading Calileo's description of the moon,
Harriot looked again and drew a big crater along the terminator (Figure 5.1b).
Probably the instruments through which he first sighted the moon revealed
more evocative detail than he had recorded." In his later lunar explorations
he used a telescope of 30X made by himself and his friends. The transfor­
mation of the Dutch gadget into an instrument powerful enough to detect
novelties in the heavens did not require a Galileo. His unique strength lay in
interpreting what he saw.
In their printed form, Galilee's renditions move from portraiture almost
to caricature." The gigantic crater cut by the terminator at quarter moon

in Figure 5-2 would be large enough, if it existed, to be seen by the naked
eye." Galileo compared it in size to Bohemia, whose rendering, on Ortelius'
widely used Atlas, may have guided the engraving of the great crater," The
flecks oflight on the moon's night side and spots of light on the day side also
indicated structures of vast scale, for, as Galileo explained, they recorded the
illumination of mountain tops and the shadows cast by crater walls: and
from these appearances he inferred the colossal scale of lunar features. In
the remarkably favorable circumstance depicted in Figure 5.3, the top of a big
mountain AD on the moon's limb is just touched by the sunray GCD; other­
wise night prevails throughout the hemisphere CAF. Galileo estimated CA
or, what is close to it, the line CD, at one-twentieth of the moon's diameter
and CF at around 2,000 miles; he then worked the Pythagorean theorem and
found that the mountain was almost five miles tall. "It is therefore manifest
that lunar peaks are loftier than terrestrial ones."?
While following the moon, Galileo noticed a host of new stars previously
invisible or blurred together. The Milky Way was not a complex terrestrial
exhalation, as Aristotle would have it, but a congeries of stars." The excite­
ment of discovery kept Galileo observing well into the night, against his

custom, in the chill December air, squinting through his imperfect glass at
patches of the night sky almost unresolvable by the unaided eye. With one of
his 30X instruments, he and his group-Sarpi, Micanzio, and others-could
"see only a hundredth of the moon at a time, but of such a size as the whole
moon appeared through the first telescope, the cavities are conspicuous and
seen so exactly, that it is truly astonishing."? Galileo understood the signifi­
cance of what he had seen, and was grateful. "I thank God from the bottom
of my heart that he has pleased to make me the sole [!] initial observer of so
many astounding things, concealed for all these ages.?"
Galileo's move from lOX espionage to 20X moon studies occurred just after
his lunatic mother had concluded a visit to Padua. Her departure may have
released his creative energies as it certainly revived his spirits. "Don't forget
to write me [Giula wrote] and to fill a page with the contentment and delight
caused by my leaving." The addressee of this directive was Calileo's servant
Alessandro Piersanti, whom Giulia tried to engage as a confidential agent. She
had good reason to want to know what plans her son had for her granddaugh­
ter Virginia, whom she took back with her to Florence." But she also wanted
Piersanti to spy and steal. She provided a sure route for correspondence and
sealed the pact by signing herself with the fearsome words, "affectionately, as
if your mother." Piersanti was to report the goings-on in Galileo's household,
insure that some linen Giulia had bought did not fall into the hands of "the
lady you work for," and purloin three or four spectacle lenses from Galileo's
store. Giulia knew exactly what she wanted, "not concave lenses for short
vision ... but plain ones that go under the tube, that is, those at the bottom
through which you can see to great distances." Apparently she had followed

154
GALILEO
the fortunes of the telescope without understanding that the secret lay in the
lens combination. "Put [the lenses] in the bottom of a little box and fill it up
with those pills of Acquapendente that I [like]." Giulia destined the stolen
lenses for Landucci. "I ask you to do this because Galileo is so ungrateful to
this man who has always cherished him"-when not suing him." Giulia's
spy ring had not informed her that Galileo had asked Christina for a modest
post for Landucci and Vinta for help in recovering a loan made by Piersanti,
who was then seriously ill, unable to work, and dependent on Galileo's char­
ity. Naturally Piersanti turned over Giulia's letters to his employer."
Had Galileo drawn up a balance of blessings during the Christmas season of
1609 he would have had to set discontent and uncertainty in his personal life
against satisfaction over confirming Ariosto's lunar landscape and detecting
myriads of unsuspected stars. His manipulative mother and aging mistress
were at stiletto points; his preteen daughters needed his attention; Sarpi's
intervention had locked him into a lifetime job in Venice while he angled for
a place in Florence; his brother Sagredo, still abroad as the Republic's consul
in Aleppo, could give neither comfort nor advice. Although Galileo's discov­
eries were notable, they did not break the bounds of earlier speculation. The
existence of stars dimmer than the dimmest we can see, and the interpreta­
tion of the mottling of the moon as earth-like features, had been canvassed
by the ancients. Galileo did not rush to publish his portraits of the moon or
the news about the stars. He hoped for something never conceived before.
Medici stars
Far above these earthly cares, in the crisp evenings of that Christmas-tide, an
ascendant Jupiter poured his rays toward Padua. Fate had placed the planet
there, alluringly bright and close, a perfect and convenient object for tele­
scopic examination. It presaged a brilliant future for astronomy, although,
being near its closest approach to earth it was retrograde, a hint that the
future might not be cloudless for the first astronomer to detect its secrets."
Sometime before 7 January 1610, when Galileo described his lunar dis­
coveries to Antonio de' Medici, he noticed through his lOX telescope
that Jupiter had lined up along the ecliptic with three little stars. The
first sighting of this striking alignment, perhaps incorporating only two
starlets, took place it seems at Sarpi's monastery in Venice." Agostino da
Mula, a Venetian patrician, an old friend of Calilco's, and an enthusiastic

CALCULATED RISKS
155
student of light and vision, claimed the honor. Or so we read in a report
by another member of Sarpi's group, Giovanni Camillo Glorioso (Plate 6),
who would succeed Galileo at Padua against the algebraist preferred by
Sarpi. Glorioso suspected that Galileo had blocked his earlier opportuni­
ties and, indulging his resentment and his jealousy, claimed that Galileo
had taken the starlets from Mula as he had the telescope from the Dutch.
If Mula did prompt Calileo's work during January of 1610, his intervention
only makes Calileo's follow-up the more extraordinary and admirable. Cali­
leo alone would recognize Mula's starlets as elements of a miniature solar
system. That took immense skill and application; or, as Glorioso explained
it, "the carefulness and industry of the Florentines.?"
We can follow this care and industry day by day in Galileo's drawings of
the changing configurations of Jupiter and the starlets. The triplet viewed
on 7 January divided two to the east and one to the west of the planet
(Figure 5.4a). On 8 January, the planet appeared to the east of all three starlets
(Figure 5Ab). Galileo inferred that the standard tables erred in listing Jupiter
as still in retrograde since it evidently had moved east with respect to the
starlets, which he naturally supposed fixed, like all other stars. He expected
to find Jupiter still further east of them on the oth, but clouds veiled the
scene; on the roth. he was startled to find the planet west of the configura­
tion and only two starlets in evidence (Figure 5.4C). On the izth there were
again three, one now smaller than the others, but with Jupiter among them,
as in Figure 5.4a. So rapid an alteration of retrograde and direct motion could

not occur on either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican theory. Galileo inferred
that the starlets accompanied Jupiter in its rounds and performed some com­
plicated minuet in their travels."
On 13 January he had another stupefying surprise. A fourth starlet had
appeared, not quite in line with the others and further than any of them
from the planet (Figure 5.4d). On the tsth, Jupiter was again east of them all,
on the iöth of three only, one having disappeared; on the roth there were
only two; and so on. What made the flighty starlets stick to Jupiter? Galileo
gave an answer for which there was no precedent. The starlets were not stars
at all, but moons. The supposition that they circled Jupiter gave a qualitative
explanation of their appearances and disappearances, and of their changing
distances from the planet. Galileo devised a second argument to enroll the
starlets among planet-like objects that would recur in his polemics over tel­
escope viewing: all stars twinkle; the starlets do not twinkle; the starlets are
not stars. This syllogism contributed to the solution of the agitated question
whether stars and planets shine by their own or by borrowed light. Kepler's
opinions may suggest the range of respectable options in 1610: stars twinkle
by reflection of sunlight; Venus, because she showed no phases, must have
some light of her own."
Our moon made a special case because of the dim glow of its dark regions
prominent around new moon. Astronomers disputed over whether the glow
arose from sunlight seeping through the moon's body, from native light, or
from sunlight reflected from the earth's surface. Galileo took this last alter­
native as his own, and wrote as if he had invented it." Several astronomers
had already traced moonglow to earthshine, notably Kepler and his teacher
Mästlin." And Sarpi had puzzled it out before either of them." The theory
made the moon earth-like by depriving it of indigenous light and the earth
moon-like by making it a reflector. Galileo also denied to planets any light
of their own. That suggested the fallacious syllogism, planets do not twinkle,
the starlets do not twinkle, therefore the starlets are planets."
On 30 January 1610 Galileo informed Vinta that he was in Venice print­
ing his account of the marvels God had vouchsafed unto him, of which the
greatest were the "four new planets ... that move around a very large star,
like Venus and Mercury, and perhaps the other known planets, do around
the sun." He feIt free enough from his state service to promise to send a
good telescope with which their highnesses could see the marvels he had
found. 59 Their highnesses expressed their enthusiasm. Galileo wrote Vinta

CALCULATED RISKS
157
again, under strictest secrecy, that he would seize the opportunity-the
first since Augustus named a star, or, as it turned out, a comet, after Cae­
sar-to promote his patrons to the heavens." Would Vinta please advise
whether pianeti cosmici or medicea sydera would suit the situation better?
Vinta replied that "cosmic" did not refer unambiguously to the modest
Medici and that the attribution of one starlet to Cosimo and one to each of
his three brothers would answer perfectly," Thus Calileo's account of his
discoveries, rushed into print early in March 1610 under the title Sidereus
nuncius, included the fanciful, fateful designation of Jupiter's moons as
Medici stars. "The Maker of the stars himself," Galileo wrote in his dedi­
cation to Cosimo, "admonished me to call these new planets by the illus­
trious name of Your Highness." Then, in the fawning style of the times,
Galileo recalled that he had long bathed in "the rays of Your [Highness']
incredible clemency and kindness ... Night and day [I reflected] on almost
nothing else than how I, most desirous of your glory (since I am not only
by desire but also by origin and nature under your dominion), might show
how very grateful I am toward you. And hence, since under your auspices,
Most Serene Cosimo, I discovered these stars unknown to all previous
astronomers, I decided by the highest right to adorn them with the very
august name of your family."?
This nonsense, however much enjoyed in Florence, did not go well in
Venice. Galileo had obtained a nice promotion by assigning to the Repub­
lic the invention he had made under its auspices as professor in Padua;
and now he was claiming that the astronomical discoveries he had made
with the same instrument, also in Padua, had occurred under the auspices
of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Furthermore, he presented his novelties,
from moonglow to Jupiter's moons, as exclusively his own observations,
interpretations, and discoveries. In announcing the new heaven, Galileo
lost sight of the help he had received on earth from his fellow observers
Sarpi, Micanzio, da Mula, and also Pignoria, who participated gamely
though worried, rightly, that "burrowing into the secrets of heaven might
be reckless."?' And Galileo neglected to mention the capital importance of
the testimony of trustworthy Venetians able to certify that the discoveries
announced in Sidereus nuncius were not optical illusions. Acknowledging his
debts to his Venetian collaborators would not help him secure the position
he designed for himself at Cosimo's court. His chief concern was not the
feelings of his friends but whether their Tuscan highnesses would manage

GALILEO
to see their stars through a telescope operated by unpracticed hands.
Should Galileo run down for Holy Week to insure successful viewing? He
was scheduled to return to Florence for the summer; but that would be too
late, for by then Jupiter and his brood would have disappeared behind the
sun. But then the trip was long and tiring and he would need a litter from
Bologna. But again, the business was of the utmost importance; another
such occasion to show his devotion might not recur." He was becoming
hysterical.
Cosimo resolved his vassal's indecision by sending a horse-drawn litter
to fetch him to Florence during Holy Week. Galileo's command perform­
ance would dispel all doubts about the marvels. "As God has privileged you
with this most singular discovery, He will also provide you with ingenious
and judicious and fluent eloquence and expression needed to present [the
subject] persuasively to everyone.?" The stakes were high. Cosimo hoped
to see a new miracle, to the confusion of the doubters, and to insure that his
subjects who had any knowledge in the matter would confirm by their own
experience the existence of the Medici stars." Galileo's stars did not desert
him. He was eloquent and persuasive and left Florence assured of the good
will of their highnesses and the experts he had convinced.
Galileo now faced the problem of persuading people outside the circles
of his Venetian colleagues and Florentine patrons that his discoveries had
the status appropriate to a premise for a demonstratio potissima in physics.
The program faced the significant impediment that far too few competent
observers had access to the means of certification to permit an appeal to the
repeated sense experience of rational animals. And even with this confirma­
tion there might remain uncertainty over whether things seen at a great dis­
tance through a glass darkly could have the same epistemological standing
as things seen clearly, naturally, and close at hand. The obvious strategy was
to distribute telescopes, directions for their use, and copies of Siderius Nuncius
as guides to viewing. Galileo pushed Cosimo to organize the distribution
without, however, having anything to distribute. In the spring of 1610 he had
lenses enough for only ten instruments and they were the acceptable residue
of 100 tries." There was also the problem whether he had the right to choose
their recipients.
The right to distribute would cease to be a problem if Galileo entered
Tuscan service. Consequently he told Vinta that he would not give out instru­
ments or disclose their "secret" without the grand duke's authorization,

CALCULATED RISKS
159
and pressed hard for a final decision about his position." Galileo reminded
Vinta that in Padua he had a lifelong salary of 1,000 scudi a year, which he
could double by private teaching and taking boarders. His official teaching
was not burdensome and otherwise "I am entirely my own master," apart
from the private students and the boarders. "If I am to return to my native
land, I desire that the primary intention of His Highness shall be to give me
leave and leisure to draw my works to a conclusion without teaching." He
would replace the foregone income by writing books "dedicated always to
my lord," and by perfecting inventions, "for of these I have a great many ...
[on which] His Highness may rest assured that he will not be wasting his
money." Galileo went on like a peddler or a della Porta: "Particular secrets,
as useful as they are curious and admirable, I have in great plenty ... Great
and remarkable things are mine ... " On his writing table were two books on
the universe ("an immense conception full of philosophy, astronomy, and
geometry"); three on motion ("an entirely new science ... discovered by me
from its very foundations"); three on mechanics ("what has been done is not
one-quarter of what I write, in quantity or otherwise"); and books on sound
and the voice, vision and colors, ocean tides, continuous quantities, military
matters ... "I must get rid of distracting thoughts that retard my studies." As
for his title, an important consideration at court, Galileo asked that it include
"philosopher" as well as "mathematician"; "for I may claim to have studied
more years in philosophy than weeks in mathematics." The letter ends with
the truest statement in it: "to me [this] is the most serious matter that exists,
concerning as it does the continuation or the complete alteration of my
present way of life."69
Cosimo quickly agreed to everything and sent 200 scudi to help with
the expenses of sending out telescopes. Galileo would have a salary of 1000
scudi for life, paid out of the funds of the University of Pisa, of which he
would be the primary mathematician without obligation to teach; he would
enjoy every aid to his work, access to their highnesses, and the title of Math­
ematician and Philosopher to the Grand Duke of Tuscany." The duke's new
star accepted the generous terms and added two requests. One was for a
two-year anticipation of his salary, to be repaid over four years, to relieve
himself of debt. The other was for a further public testimonial. Cosimo had
had a gold medal engraved with the Medici stars. Galileo asked that it be
displayed with an attribution of their discovery to him. The House of Medici
had been very fortunate. "No other heroic deed approaches the [discovery

160
GALILEO
of Jupiter's moons] in nobility or praiseworthiness." Let Cosimo show his
gratitude for his quartet of stars. "Fortune reserved them for him alone and
took them from everyone else: and I have now begun to suspect that there
are no other planets.'?'
Toward the Demonstratio potissima
To whom should the first instruments go? Mathematicians? Philosophers?
They would merely quarrel and raise objections until, when they accepted
the inevitable, they would claim priority in its discovery. It would be better to
give them to princes, who could instruct their mathematicians to take care
how they dealt with a prominent courtier of a fellow prince, and who would
want to possess the instrument that showed (or made!) so many marvels.
Convince the princes and the rabble will follow. Cuius regio, eius religio.72 Gali­
leo began with princes close to home, notably cardinals-his reliable patron
Francesco Maria del Monte, and cardinals Scipione Borghese and Odoardo
Farnese. Borghese preceded the Holy Roman Emperor in Galileo's paro­
chial politics because he was the pope's nephew, and Farnese, though only
the son of a duke, came before the Queen of France even though she was a
Medici." When the emperor discovered that a mere cardinal had bumped
him, he observed that Galileo should value his work more highly. Marie de'
Medici appealed on the ground that her late husband, Henri IV, assassinated
on 10 May 1610, had wished to commission Galileo to find him a new star or
two. Still she had to wait. No doubt the emperor and the queen would have
shown their gratitude most royally, outdoing Borghese, who gave Galileo a
gold chain, and del Monte, who offered a quantity of indulgences blessed
by the pope." The Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian I, having received a copy
of Sidereus nuncius through his lutanist, the author's brother Michelangelo,
expressed his enthusiasm volubly, "which is not a little ... as he is a man of
few words," and, of course, wanted a telescope. Although he was prepared to
reward Galileo handsomely for one, he dwelt too far from Florence to have
priority. Michelangelo saw only the money motive. "Even if I am not a prince
able to remunerate you, I am at least your brother, and so it seems strange
that you do not want to satisfy my desire [for a telescope].'?'
Perhaps the best indication of the burden of proof Galileo had to lift in the
spring of 1610 by the adroit bestowal of telescopes is Bartoli's report of the
view from Venice:

CALCULATED RISKS
161
Everyone is reading and thinking about Galileo's book in which he
makes a show of having found four new planets with his occhiale, and
seen another world in the moon, and similar things, which open a
delightful pastime to professors of these sciences, especially because
of the title of Siderea medicea. I can not refrain from saying that many
of these gentlemen now think that he has made fun of them when he
gave out as a secret the common spyglass [cannone] on sale in the street
for four or five lire, of the same quality, it is said, as his. They laugh at
[these discoveries], and call them rash, while he tried to make them
a great feat, and has done so, and gained an increase in salary of 500
fiorentini. I understand that he really is a most worthy man and a friend
of F. Paolo ... 76
Certification stumbled not only because of a dearth of good telescopes, but
also from an abundance of bad ones and, whether good or bad, from inept
operators. Recipients of Galileo's handiwork did not always know how to
correct for its adjustment to his peculiar sight, keen and clear on the right,
weak and fuzzy on the left." And every user of a high-powered telescope of
Galilean design faced the problem of mounting it so that it would be both
maneuverable and fixable.
Galileo unintentionally demonstrated the problems of his equipment
himself during a stop off in Bologna when returning to Padua after his tri­
umph at Cosimo's court. Neither Magini nor any of the other twenty learned
men present saw Jupiter's moons. One observer, Magini's myopic assistant
Martin Horky, advised his patron Kepler and other German mathematicians
that the Medici stars did not exist, and went after the sideral messenger and
his message in small book published in June 1610.78 Denounced in turn by
Magini, Horky fled to Milan and his good friend Capra, whom he trusted to
distribute his book where it would do the most harm, and then on to Prague,
where Kepler told him that he had made an ass of himself."
Horky may have been a better observer of Galileo than of the stars. Here
is his portrait of our hero after the debacle in Bologna:
His hair hung down; his skin, in its tiniest folds, is covered with marks
of the mal français; his skull is affected, delirium fills his mind; his optic
nerves are destroyed because he has scrutinized minutes and sec­
onds around Jupiter with too much curiosity and presumption; his
vision, hearing, taste and touch are shot; his hands have the nodules

162
GALILEO
of the gout because he has stolen physical and mathematical treasure;
his heart palpitates because he has sold everyone a celestial fable ...
Fortunate and thrice happy the physician who returns the sick mes­
senger to health."
Some of this agrees with Galilee's own descriptions of his physical condition.
He began to suffer severe rheumatic attacks at the age of forty, in 1604/5. He
shivered in the summer of 1608 with a persistent fever. He was bed-ridden
during most of the winter of 1610/11 with severe miscellaneous pains, sleep­
lessness, discharges of blood, and depression (melancholy)." Horky noticed
delirium, arising from the French disease. That was probably a good hit; the
Galileo-Sagredo life style almost guaranteed a dose of syphilis, whose symp­
toms can mimic those of other ailments. No doubt Galileo had overstrained
his eyes portraying the moon and chasing the Medici stars. The gout goes
well with Galileo's indulgence in wine and with his tendency to rheumatic
ailments. As for palpitations, Galileo may already have been suffering from
the irregular heartbeat of which he later complained. Although we can safely
reject Horky's etiology of moral faults, his description may show us some­
thing of the true Galileo striving desperately, when ill and overworked, to
persuade influential mathematicians and philosophers of his trustworthi­
ness. Heroes must be tried.
The first important astronomer to endorse Galileo's findings unequivo­
cally was Kepler. He did so after reading a gift copy of Sidereus nuncius for­
warded by the Florentine ambassador to Prague, Giuliano de' Medici, with
the request that Kepler write a commentary on it. Kepler was elated by the
book, though not for a reason easily guessed. He had been distressed by
rumors about Galileo's discoveries because there was no place in his uni­
verse for even one more planet. So he had conjectured that Galileo had seen
moons, one around Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and once again was
right for a wrong reason." It followed for Kepler that if the earth had a single
moon and Jupiter four, Mars should have two and Saturn eight. He urged
Galileo to look for them. If found, they might explain why the dimensions of
the planetary system as worked out by Platonic solids did not agree perfectly
with the observations of Tycho Brahe. There had to be space to accommo­
date the moons!" Galileo looked and was pleased not to see another moon.
The Medici stars remained unique in the planetary system-provided that
the earth was not a planet.

CALCULATED RISKS
Kepler did not risk much in accepting the lunar landscape or the multitude
of moons." He accepted the main obstacle to belief, the Medici moons, for
a hard-headed romantic reason. As he wrote Magini, Copernicans had no
reason to mislead one another deliberately," Galileo would not risk his good
reputation (and his prince's') on claims that anyone with a proper telescope
could prove false." In September 1610, having put his hands on the telescope
that Galileo had presented to the Prince-Elector-Archbishop of Cologne,
Ernst of Bavaria, Kepler confirmed by telescope what he had endorsed in
Copernican fellowship. Both he and Thomas Segeth, who served as a literal
eyewitness, could see everything advertised in Sidereus nuncius except one of
the four Medici moons. They deemed that sufficient to corroborate all of
Galileo's claims." During the same month Galileo took up his position as
the Grand Duke's Mathematician and Philosopher.
Galileo's desertion of the Venetian Republic aroused perplexity as well as
anger." Why was he so eager to place himself with a mediocre prince and a
priest-ridden court? The reasons he gave Vinta-the desire to free himself
from teaching and from the demands of his various patrons-perhaps were
the weightiest. He saw other advantages as well. He knew that to conquer
Italy he would have to convince the Jesuits to abandon Aristotle's cosmol­
ogy. This monumental task could not be shouldered in Venice, where citi­
zens still were prohibited formally from corresponding with the Society of
Jesus and where Galileo had its bêtes noires Sarpi and Cremonini for friends.
In Florence, interaction with Jesuits was only too easy. Counterintuitive as
later events may make it appear, Galileo probably regarded easier access to
Jesuit mathematicians and philosophers as an attraction in 1610. One of the
first letters he wrote after moving to Florence reopened his correspondence
with Clavius, interrupted, as Galileo wrote, for "reasons I need not detail to
your perceptiveness.?"
Then there was Galilee's quixotic desire, compounded of nostalgia, ambi­
tion, and wishful thinking, to serve Cosimo. He had been at the fringes of
the court since boyhood through his father's musician friends, the literary
cardsharps around Ricasoli, the court mathematician Ricci, and, latterly,
his summer tutee, the heir to the grand duchy. Galileo had been impressed
by the magnificence of the Medici in action, their ability to mobilize their
wealth for weddings if not for warfare, and their undemocratic favoritism
of those they deemed worthy of it. A correspondent put his finger on it.
"I knew that your devotion to your prince was enough to make you leave

GALILEO
something better [to serve him] ."90 Although Cosimo was no Charlemagne,
Galileo would be his Orlando: and just as a single great champion of yester­
year could turn a battle against the odds, so Galileo, secure in the support
of his prince, would rout the armies that opposed him. Or, to change the
metaphor, the Florentine court would become the Archimedean place, and
the telescope the lever, from and with which Galileo would move the Aristo­
telian system to the garbage heap of history.
On a lower level of novelty though perhaps not of priority, moving to
Florence implied parting from Marina. There was no room for her, spatially
or emotionally, at the Tuscan court, and scarcely more for their children."
Vincenzo, then not yet five, would remain in Padua with Marina; Livia would
come with Galileo to Florence to join Virginia. One of Galileo's first cares
was to find a nice nunnery where the girls could be taught whatever they
needed to know. Already he had made arrangements to place Virginia in a
convent at a cost of 42 scudi a year plus expenses for a bed and other necessi­
ties." And he would pay for Vincenzo's upkeep and perhaps also something
toward Marina's. Galileo did not shirk the financial, only the emotional,
responsibility of maintaining his children.
And so, having completed "the best eighteen years of my life," Galileo
took up the career of a courtier. From a lowly professor he had risen to a
high-class jester, expected to help relieve the dull and punctilious court rou­
tine by producing an occasional wonder." He arrived in September 1610,
, after a brief stay with Magini. He had to come by litter as he was too weak
to ride a horse."
5.2 CELESTIAL MESSENGER
A new Columbus
Galileo's startling revelations upsetthose who pretended to know the cos­
mos and delighted many who were content to know only the world. Tricks
they might be, or perhaps prodigies, "forse prestigi I son questi 0 di natura
alti prodigi."?' Philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition had either to reject
Calileo's findings or patch their philosophies to accommodate an earth-like
moon and a secondary center (Jupiter) for lunar motions. The curious edu­
cated received the celestial message as an announcement of a new America
and, dependent on temperament, rejoiced in or despaired of an age so full of

novelties. Here are some strains from the joyful. "You were born to honor
our country.':" "Your Lordship! In you God not only united all the gifts that
formerly He had spread among other men, but also vested ... the revelation
of new heavens, of which he made you the new Atlas! He has led you along
paths never trod before by the human mind, like a new Columbusl"?'
Comparison of Galileo with Columbus became a refrain. Italy can now
boast "the discoverer of a new part of the world as well as the discoverer of
a new world of stars." Only Italy could produce a Columbus of the cosmos,
Dutch barbarians could never have done it. Thomas Segeth: "Columbus
gave us lands with much bloodshed I Galileo stars with no injury. Which is
greaterj"?" Could there be a doubt? Calileo's is the greater achievement "in the
same proportion as the heavens are more noble than the earth." Greater than
Columbus, greater than Tiphys (the pilot chosen by Athena to steer Jason to
the Golden Fleece) is the celestial navigator: "You, greater than the one and
the other I Looked into the world of the stars I In inaccessible regions far
away I And interned within these recesses unknown I In their profundity
you knew how to find I New orbs new light new movement.':"
This is dull stuff. Let us allow ourselves some enthusiasm. Ilario Altobello:
Galileo has eclipsed the glory of the astronomers of old, of Hipparchus,
Ptolemy, Copernicus, the Egyptians, the Chaldeans. Kepler: Galileo's very
name implies divine things, prophetic things. Was it not asked of Christ's
apostles, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven?" They had
stopped to watch their lord ascend before they turned to spreading His
gospel; and soon after they set to work, they had turned everyone who spoke
about higher things into a Galilean. Dom Castelli, the modern-day man of
Galilee's chief apostle, read the short new gospel, Sidereus nuncius, ten times,
soaking himself in the "deep learning, high thought, learned speculations,
and ... the marvelous harmony and unity of it all." To which the prior of Cas­
telli's abbey in Brescia added, "How happy is our age in which Sig. Galilei has
made such stupendous discoveries."?"
Galileo and probably also the Medici solicited poetical accolades for the
Italian edition of Sidereus nuncius that never appeared. A folder of these pro­
fusions survives. It contains 40 hexameters, 10 Sapphic odes, two epigrams,
and four distiches, all in Latin, all by Jesuits. Perhaps the earliest and best of
them, by the Neapolitan Costanzo Pulcarelli, installs Galileo as a new Atlas,
whose brilliance frightened the heavens into switching on new stars to com­
pete with him.'?' The poets were to serve Galileo as newspapers do modern

166
GALILEO
scientists, advertising and celebrating discoveries before the experts had
their say.'?' Starring in heroic poetry can go to a man's head. Galileo began
to identify himself with his message. Nuncius can mean "message," as Gali­
leo first intended, or "messenger." Kepler and, following him, most modern
translators, take nuncius in this second sense. Although wrong as to Calileo's
original intention, they catch his subsequent conviction that he was an agent
of the stars, and even of God their creator.'?'
After his quick survey disclosed no moons around the other planets, Gali­
leo set himself to determining the periods of the revolutions of Jupiter's sat­
ellites. The problem, "truly Atlantic," that is, worthy of an Atlas, took him a
year and more to solve. It required distinguishing the moons and inferring
their orbits in space from their changing angular distances from Jupiter and
the intervals between their occultations. Everyone knowledgeable hailed it as
a feat: and indeed, the accuracy of his determinations, to within five minutes
of time, amazes modern connoisseurs as it did Galileo's contemporaries.
In his combination of stubbornness and dexterity, intuition and geometry,
acuity of mind and sight, he surpassed all the observers of his age.'?' What
made him persevere in a task that Kepler had declared virtually insoluble?
"I rely on the Dear Lord, who, having had the grace to make me the only
one to detect so many and new wonders from his Hand, will permit me to
find the absolute order of their revolutions.'?" Perhaps the worry that the
Devil might help Magini, who opposed Copernicus and loved to calculate,
strengthened his resolve.l'"
When the moons became unobservable in the summer of 1610, Galileo
looked carefully for other secrets that God might have reserved for him. He
turned his glass on his fellow melancholic, Saturn. Another marvel! The old
boy was not his former circular self, but three-bodied, "accompanied by two
attendants who never leave his side." The news was too hot to conceal and
too useful to reveal. Galileo announced it as if he were a prophet speaking
in tongues: "smaismrmilmepoetale," quoth he, "umibunenugttauriras." He
dispatched this news to Prague with the hint that it concealed a celestial mes­
sage. It drove Kepler to distraction. Even he could not extract "altissimum
planetam tergeminum observavi" from the scramble.l'" No more could Har­
riot, who made ten or maybe fifty tries at it. Galileo decoded it around the
end of Decernber.!"
Saturn's deformity worked wonders for astronomers. Frightened by it,
Emperor Rudolf commanded his mathematician Kepler to check it out,

CALCULATED RISKS
gave him 200 scudi for his trouble, and promised to pay the arrears on his
stipend, which by then amounted to many thousands. Rudolf also promised
to square accounts with Magini, whom he owed for a burning mirror. (Both
Kepler and Magini had thought to improve their financial position by trying
for Calileo's chair in Padua.) The three-bodied Saturn settled a third account
of greater interest to Galileo than the income of his colleagues. Horky threw
in the towel. He would give two quarts of blood, he said, without specifying
whose, not to have written against a man who could pull such wonders out
of the sky,'?"
Galileo did not keep his eyes on Saturn for long. Venus, leaving her bath of
solar rays, emerged into the evening sky in June 1610. She had a great secret
to reveal. Though on both the Ptolemaic and the Copernican systems Venus
should show phases, she nonetheless appears with unchanging brightness
to the unaided eye. Copernicus had signaled the importance of the miss­
ing phases of Venus and, as we know, Kepler had allowed Venus some light
of her own to account for her constant intensity.':" Much depended on a
better answer. If the telescope could untangle the counterbalancing effects
of distance and phase, which counterfeit constant intensity, it could indi­
cate whether Venus revolved around the sun or, as in the Ptolemaic system,
she spent all her time either above or below it. In 1610, the transition to
half-planet (phase 5 in Figure 5.5b), which is not a possible Ptolemaic form,
occurred in December.'!'
Despite the known importance of the question, there is no word in Gali­
leo's correspondence or entry in his notebooks about the phases of Venus
before 11 December 1610. On that day he wrote to Prague, briefly, inquiring
what Kepler thought of the triune Saturn and transmitting another torment
for the poor fellow, Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur o:y. The plain text,
apart from its hint at Jewish ancestry, means "I am now bringing these unripe
things together in vain, Oy!" It concealed the discovery of the long-sought
Venusian phases. Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum, the decrypted text
reads, "The mother of love [Venus] copies the forms of Cynthia [the moon]."
On 30 December Galileo gave two different accounts of the observations
underlying this important finding. One, addressed to Clavius, placed their
start when Venus was first visible after nightfall. Then at its greatest distance
from the earth and near the sun, it appeared very round and small (Figure
5.5b, phase 4). The other letter, addressed to Castelli, who had reminded
Galileo some three weeks earlier of the question of phases, stated that the

CALCULATED RISKS
observations began three months before the time of writing. Both accounts
then describe the change from the small round phase to a gibbous one,
increasing in size as the planet drew closer to the earth until, at maximum
elongation, only half was visible (phase 5). Continuing toward lower con­
junction, its magnitude growing as its lit portion diminished to a crescent, it
would, as Galileo guessed, become bigger, thinner, and more horned (phase
6) until it again disappeared into the sun.!"
The coincidence in timing between Castelli's letter of 5 December, point­
ing out that detection of the right phases should "convince any mind obsti­
nate against Copernicus," and Galileo's letter to Prague of 11 December
containing the encrypted discovery, has aroused suspicion among exact
chronologists.'!' The interest in the suspicion does not lie in the charge that
Galileo portrayed Castelli's suggestion as his own. We know that often he
came to think of ideas he had developed and enriched as originating with
him, as exemplified by the compass, telescope, and pusilogium, and the
appropriations from del Monte, Sarpi, and the Venetian telescope group.'!'
The interest in the suspicion lies in the question why, if he did not undertake
serious study of Venus until prompted by Castelli, or, as seems more likely,
until October 1610 as indicated in his reply to Castelli, he had delayed so
long in pursuing an inquiry so interesting to Copernicans. One plausible
explanation is that he was too deeply engaged in patron politics and Jovian
studies to undertake anything less promising.t" Another is that he inclined
toward Kepler's view that Venus has an intrinsic brightness that swamped
the phases.!"
A third possibility is that he did not regard detection of the phases as
determinative. The limited elongation of Venus (and Mercury) showed
clearly enough that they circled the sun, as several ancient astronomers had
taught, and Galileo had taken for granted in Sidereus nuncius. When decoding
his Cynthia riddle, he said that the phases showed beyond doubt that Venus
shines by reflected light and also, of course, circles the sun, "as do Mercury
and all the other planets." Pythagoras had believed' as much, and so had
Copernicus, but only Galileo had managed to "prove by the senses" that the
superior planets behave like the inferior ones.'!' Galileo might have added
Tycho to the list of believers, because as he well knew and one of his support­
ers reminded him, putting the planets around the sun did not entail putting
the earth in motion.!" Until Galileo added, "and the earth is a planet," to
the proposition that all planets revolve around the sun, or endorsed the full

170
GALILEO
Copernican theory, his formulation of the conclusion forced by the sequence
of Venus' phases agreed perfectly with the Tychonic system.'!"
The shapes of Venus astonished astronomers as much as the mountains
on the moon. She seemed so bright and round! None of Kepler's eight tries
at deciphering the anagram ending in "oy" ("you see what misery I suffer
from your reticence") concerned Venus.w In Venice and Padua, where the
Galilean faithful had cudgeled their brains over the riddle, there was satis­
faction as well as amazement that their master had done it again.!" Magini
sent congratulations from the Bologna group, now convinced of the inadvis­
ability of doubting Calileo's claims. And an old Italian hand, Mark Welser,
a prominent banker in Augsburg close to the Jesuits who was to play an
important part in circulating Calileo's ideas, applauded the detection of the
phases but failed to see why they implied that Venus goes around the sun.!"
To make clear how the phases of his Venus differed from those expected on
the Ptolemaic system, Galileo would have had to adopt openly either Tycho's
or Copernicus' model. And that he was not prepared to do before the Jesuits
were on side.
Roman holiday
In his revived correspondence with Clavius, Galileo expressed an intention
of visiting Rome to show the Medici stars to the astronomers of the Roman
College. Cigoli urged that he come soon, as the Jesuits could not find their way
around heaven without help and Clavius himself thought the sidera medicea a
hoax.!" Christoph Grienberger, soon to be Clavius' successor, rated Jupiter's
companions and Venus' phases as optical illusions, and lunar mountains as
entirely imaginary. Then one of their colleagues, Giovanni Paolo Lembo,
made a telescope that resolved the stars in Orion and the Pleiades, and even­
tually Clavius himself procured a Galilean telescope from a cardinal to test
the rest of Sidereus nuncius. By then, the fall of 1610, the world had freed itself
from Galilco's optical monopoly. Antonio Santini, a merchant of Venice,
succeeded in September in seeing the Medici stars through a telescope he
had made; not finding the making difficult, he deduced that Galileo's oppo­
nents were either incompetent or obstinate. In October he delivered this
insight, and soon also lenses, to Clavius; and on 4 November he could report
to Galileo that the clavisti had seen the Medici stars.'?' Meanwhile Galileo
had worked on the Jesuits within his reach. All those stationed in Florence

CALCULATED RISKS
and many who passed through had the opportunity of seeing the disputed
starlets under the direction of their discoverer.t"
Clavius' group, which included Grienberger and ado van Maelcote, had
not found the observations easy even with a good telescope. "No doubt this
instrument would be of inestimable value, if it were not so difficult to use."!"
Galileo reassured Clavius that all his group needed was practice and crowed
to others that, at last, the Jesuits had recognized the truth and "confessed
it."127 Delighted at the news, Cosimo enthusiastically supported Calileo's
proposed trip to Rome. It would be done in style. The grand duke supplied
a litter, paid the expenses of Galileo and a servant, and procured rooms for
them at the main Medici villa in Rome. Illness and bad weather prevented
departure until spring. Galileo arrived in Rome on the Tuesday of Holy
Week, 29 Mar 1611, carrying a letter from Cosimo asking Cardinal del Monte
to favor Calileo's enterprise, "for his merit (a born Florentine), for the public
interest, and for the glory of our age."128
The day after his arrival Galileo visited the Roman College. He found the
fathers chuckling over an attack on him made around Christmas 1610 by a
reckless young man named Francesco Sizzi, whom Kepler placed on the same
mental level as Horky. The title of Sizzi's Christmas present to the learned
world, Dianoia astronomica, optica et physica, intimated that it would defeat an
opinion with facts. The opinion was Galileo's assumption that he could see
accurately to Jupiter. Against it Sizzi marshalled the "facts" that refraction
distorts the more the further away the object viewed; that the telescope is
unreliable over a distance greater than a sixth of the earth's radius; and that
Jupiter is distant 17,615 terrestrial radii. Galileo's assertion implied a reliable
scale-up of the same order of magnitude and incredibility as his conclusion
to the stability of the Inferno from a model 200,000 times smaller. What
effrontery! "And who are you, who presumes to descry I Such distant things
a thousand miles off I Glancing from your bench with a feeble eye?"!" Gali­
leo did not join wholeheartedly in his hosts' merriment over Sizzi's pseudo­
quantitative rhetoric and his objections based on scripture, which also made
them smile; for Sizzi was a Florentine, who deserved consideration from an
official representative of the grand duke. Moreover, he had the protection of
Don Giovanni de' Medici, to whom Sizzi had dedicated his dianoia.!'?
The astronomers of the Roman College could laugh at Sizzi because they
had managed to see everything that Galileo had reported from the skies.
With their confirmation, the rejection of Jovian planetoids, Venusian phases,

172
GALILEO
and so on as artifacts of the telescope lost all plausibility. Even in Belgium,
so wrote a former student of Galileo's stationed there, the truth would out.
Welser in Augsburg accepted the judgment of the Roman College and read it
as a God-sent lesson in humility, "that we may recognize how little we know
in comparison to what we do not know."!" Even the Inquisition accepted the
substance if not the spirit of the lesson. Its vigilant theologian, Bellarmine,
who was quite prepared to discover things in the heavens unsuspected by
Aristotle, asked Clavius' group for an official evaluation of the telescope and
the observations Galileo claimed to make with it. On all points the clavisti­
Clavius himself, Grienberger, Maelcote, and Lembo-approved the findings,
with the notable exception that Clavius, for whom things were moving too
quickly, thought that the irregularities seen on the moon might arise from
differences in density, rather than of height, of moon stuff.132 On hearing
this Cigoli scoffed that the dean of Jesuit mathematicians did not understand
perspective. Still, the approval of the Roman College was a great victory, per­
sonal as well as scientific. Piero Dini, a Florentine man of letters who had
moved to Rome to serve his cardinal uncle, and who would become a con­
fidential agent for Galileo, saw the mathematicians' reply to Bellarmine. The
bottom line, in Dini's judgment: Galileo and the Jesuits had become "great
friends."!"
There remained the omen of Clavius' reluctance to allow mountains on
the moon. He owed this resistance to his conscience and to his colleagues of
the Roman College, who had followed his lead over the forty years since he
had first published his view that Copernican theory opposed sound philoso­
phy, standard astronomy, and Holy Writ. The inference from an earth-like
lunar landscape to earth-like moon stuff, and thence to the destruction of
the capital distinction on which the Aristotelian cosmos turned, was only
too obvious. The cool cheese of the ancients had become a hot potato for
the moderns; or, to improve the metaphor, Galileo's mountains were philo­
sophical as well as physical monsters. To Galileo's growing impatience, the
Jesuit mathematicians on whom he had counted declined to admit his or
embrace another interpretation of the lunar surface.'>' The philosophers-of
the Roman College did not shrink from the task, however. In 1612 the pro­
fessor of physics, Girolamo Piccolomini, whose cosmological views differed
little from his predecessors' a generation back, told his students that the
lunar features probably arose from shadows cast by rarer parts near brightly
illuminated denser parts, "as we see in little spheres made of amber or crystal

CALCULATED RISKS
173
that appear spotted because they are not uniformly dense and lucid."!» The
idea that the blotches Galileo saw lay within a perfectly spherical, opales­
cent or transparent moon was not hard to find. It occurred to Ludovico delle
Colombe.
Galileo made good sport of the argument in a lengthy letter, doubtless
intended for circulation, to the factotum of Cardinal Joyeuse, Gallanzone
Gallanzoni. What is so splendid about sphericity? A man would not be
more perfect for being spherical, nor the earth either, since God had had
the opportunity to make it so, round and even, at the Creation and again at
the Deluge, but had decided that it would better suit the non-spherical life
forms here if rough and jagged.136 You could take the earth together with
its atmosphere to be a perfect sphere or believe in invisible moon moun­
tains thousands of miles high. But then, Galileo continued, you would not be
doing astronomy, which is not a game of the imagination but a science based
on "sensory experience and necessary demonstration." This phrase, which
became a battle cry, related to the demonstratio potissima.137 Despite their res­
ervations about the mountains, Galileo interpreted the Jesuits' endorsement
of his findings as a major step to the completion of the consensus required
to establish a premise in physics.
On 18 May Galileo returned to the Roman College to be celebrated before
all its students and professors, and also princes, prelates, and cardinals.
Maelcote gave an oration on the work of "the nuncius," the sidereal messen­
ger there present, including his three-bodied Saturn and many-splendored
Venus.l" Naturally Galileo also attended literary assemblies. At one of them,
held in the palace of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Deti, he heard his old friend
Strozzi give a talk on the timely topic of pride; and a very good talk, Galileo
reported to Vinta, which made him proud to be a Florentine. Everywhere
Galileo was the lion of the season. He added several purple supporters-Car­
dinals Ottavio Bandini (Dini's uncle), Tiberio Muti, François de Joyeuse, and,
with the help of a letter from Buonarroti, who had become a proselytizer for
Calileo's celestial discoveries, Maffeo Barberini.139 Thus began a friendship
that would end in an enmity of world-historical importance.
Barberini came from a noble commercial Florentine family that marked
its upgrading in the iöth century by replacing the three silver wasps or
(according to detractors) horse flies on its escutcheon with as many golden
bees. Maffeo, who was to plaster the bees all over Rome, studied law at
Pisa after the usual education under the Jesuits in Florence and Rome. At

174
GALILEO
Pisa he lived in the same house as Buonarroti, whom he had known since
childhood. They slept on broken mattresses in the same room. "If I had only
known I that some day Maffeo would be the Pope I My bed I would have laid
upon a stone I or on a rough tile way down the roof's slope." Thus Buonar­
roti, a poetical prodigy, who had been elected to the Accademia fiorentina
at the callow age of seventeen.!" Barberini too was a poet. Most of what he
wrote around his time at Pisa, which coincided with Galileo's teaching stint
there, was in the mildly erotic Petrarchan mode. A specimen reads:
Now your lips of coral bring back to me
Cheeks suffused with carmine, a milk white breast
Now you show your lovely eyes like twin stars
Your blonde tresses and your sparkling white hands
A mind all yours has long roamed within me
Why then, Portia, have you so many snares?':"
The Portia picked out for Maffeo did not like the match. Rebuffed, he entered
the Curia through the good offices of a rich uncle able to buy him a good
place in the bureaucracy. He rose quickly, to special envoy, and then nun­
cio, to France. His four years in and around the Court of Henry IV inspired
a Francophilia that would have significant consequences for foreign poliey
during his papacy. Paul V made him a cardinal at the time of the great Vene­
tian interdict, and then, in the year he met Galileo, legate to Bologna. In the
interim Barberini had set up a magnificent establishment in Rome with
a legacy from his uncle and began to practice the nepotism for which he
later became a watchword. Maffeo Barberini was shrewd, handsome, quick,
attentive to business and the arts, but cautious, distrustful, stubborn, easy to
anger, and indifferent to the opinions of others (Plate to). In short, a Floren­
tine like Galileo.!"
Galileo made other important contacts during his Roman holiday, includ­
ing Paul V, who received him with the honor due a savant with the wisdom
to leave Venice for Florence.!" At the salon of Margherita Sarroechi, he met
many other well-wishers.':" Most important for Galileo's future, indeed for
Italian cultural history and the history of science, was his meeting with Fed­
erico Cesi (Plate 11), a prince in waiting who enjoyed the favor of the pope.
When only 18, Cesi had had the extraordinary idea of forming a learned soci­
ety, which, according to its statutes of 1605, would study natural science and
mathematics, pursue new knowledge and publish discoveries. Since he had no

CALCULATED RISKS
175
scientific standing himself and knew no one who did, Cesi's first lynxes, as he
called his academicians, were odd animals. Besides himself, the initial group
consisted of two other young noblemen and a Dutch doctor whom Cesi
extracted from the jail in which he languished for murdering an apothecary.
The ceremony in which Cesi initiated the first three members of his broth­
erhood captures the sense of Christian knighthood with which he infused
his Order. On Christmas day 1603, dressed in a long robe, he called each
brother in turn, read him the rules, swore him to obey them, and gave him
a gold chain bearing the image of a lynx. The murderous medic Johannes
van Heeck (Eck) understood the relationship of the brothers to the founder
as one of liegeman to lord: "we are only brothers, but you, Oh Lord, are our
prince." "Love [of you] belongs to us," declared Francesco Stellutti, the most
faithful and competent of the original group, "to you, the empire to which
you were born, and to which you were destined from heaven."!"
Cesi's father Federico, Marchese di Monticello, Duke of Acquasparta, took
alarm at his son's involvement in a homoerotic band inclined toward mysti­
cism and melodrama, organized like a religious order, and perilously close to
heresy.':" He quickly put an end to it. Eck drifted to Prague. Cesi hastened to
Naples, to master mysteries under della Porta. They got on well as each had
a use for the other-Cesi needed the cachet that association with so great a
luminary would bring, and della Porta saw promise in patronizing the heir
to a great title and fortune. Cesi learned many "secrets" to convey to his little
band and della Porta established himself as its primary advisor. In 1610 Cesi
was able to revive his almost extinct lynxes. They then numbered three of
the original four: Cesi himself, Eck now back in Rome, and Stelluti. In July
Cesi made della Porta a lynx and eventually his vice president and head of a
satellite den in Naples. Stelluti became general business manager in Rome.
Cesi too was on the rise. In 1610 he was but a marquess; in 1613, by special
nomination of Paul V, he became Prince of St Angelo and St Polo, so titled
after two of his village holdings.':"
Cesi thus was prepared to bag the lion of the season when he met Galileo
in Rome in the spring of 1611. Their collaboration began with a dinner party
Cesi gave for a dozen other guests at a villa on the top of the Gianicolo from
which many prominent buildings in the city could be seen. The party began
before sundown to allow viewers to read the letters on the distant façade of
San Giovanni in Laterano through Galileo's telescope. After dinner every­
one tried to see the moons of Jupiter, with mixed success. The participants

GALILEO
all agreed, however, that the suggestion of the mathematician to the Duke
of Gonzaga, John Demisiani, to call Galileo's instrument "telescope," was a
happy one.':" Eleven days after the party, on 25 April 1611, Cesi made a lynx of
the lion. That gave him two big beasts, Galileo and della Porta, both of whom
claimed the invention of the telescope. Since Cesi's academy very seldom
met, the two could co-exist in it without deciding which if either of them
was the inventor.':"
Although Cesi supported a range of interests as befitted an academic
impresario, he recognized the special importance of astronomy. He followed
and admired the work of Tycho and Kepler. It was he who pointed out to
Galileo the importance of Kepler's Dioptrics (1612), which gave the world the
theory of the telescope and Kepler as much pleasure (Kepler supposed) as
the discoveries announced in Sidereus nuncius gave Calileo.!" The first publi­
cation by a lynx concerned the nova of 1604. It was the work of Eck, then in
Prague, suffering from the intellectual companionship of Kepler's entourage.
He agreed with them that the nova resided above the moon, but not that the
heavens could change unless by special act of God; and he filled his little
essay with nasty remarks about the heretical antiperipatetics among whom
he had the misfortune to find himself. Since Cesi wanted to forge ties with
Kepler and believed that the heavens do change, he edited out Eck's vitriol
and changed his text to favor a more progressive astronomy.'!' Cesi later
wrote Galileo that he had shared the ideas of Tycho and Kepler-the fluidity
and alterability of the heavens-attacked by Eck and that since then he had
come to accept the elliptical orbits Kepler had introduced in 1609.152 In this
he was more advanced than his new Florentine academician.
Galileo placed great store in his membership in Cesi's academy. He identi­
fied himself as a lynx on the title pages of his books and referred to himself
in his dialogues as "the academician." Why? No doubt he thought that the
young, energetic aristocrat with excellent ecclesiastical connections would
help him maintain the interest and patronage he had won in Rome. In addi­
tion, Cesi's concept of a band of scholars pursuing free inquiry under the
beneficent eye of a prince appealed to Calileo's romantic as well as to his
practical bent. Although Cesi had outgrown some of his adolescent roman­
ticism by 1611, he retained the concept of a band of chosen servitors. All
lynxes, he wrote Galileo, had the true nobility of independent minds. They
owed allegiance to their prince, and so could not enter a religious order; oth­
erwise they were free, or, rather, obligated, to think as they pleased.!" Galileo

CALCULATED RISKS
177
liked the idea of being the Orlando or Ruggiero of such a group, which soon
added Valerio and Welser to its roll, and the novelty of having the intellec­
tual support of a prince. With this encouragement he could risk accepting
Kepler's old challenge to come out strongly for Copernicus.'>'
The Roman holiday was a great triumph. Had it been ancient Rome, so
Cardinal del Monte wrote Grand Duke Cosimo, the city fathers would have
erected a statue in Galileo's honor in the capitol. Something potentially more
useful was created at the Roman College. Shortly after his return to Florence
Galileo received a very friendly letter from Grienberger conveying to him in
Florence the warm greetings of all the Jesuit mathematicians in Rorne.!"
5.3 MORE RABBITS FROM THE HAT
Sinking bodies
Filippo Salviati was the sort of man Galileo delighted to know. He was as
noble a Florentine as could be found, related to all the families that counted,
generous, open-minded, clever, and rich, richissimo. He had been raised for
war and courts, enjoyed the similar pursuits of jousting and dancing, and,
like Galileo, had a compulsion to serve his prince. The knightly virtues of
Ariosto's paladins would have had a late flowering in Salviati if ill health had
not militated against a military career. In 1606, at the age of 24, he decided
to retool himself for a quieter life. He learned Latin and Greek, advanced to
Aristotle and the philosophers, and had reached mathematics when Galileo
returned to Florence. They became teacher and student, client and patron,
friends. Between 1611 and 1613, Galileo spent many months at Salviati's villa
Le Selve outside Florence recovering from his various ailments, writing, and
disputing with the learned guests that Salviati patronized.'> The delights of
Le Selve included many varieties of creature comfort. Salviati employed two­
dozen servants and four soldiers for a domestic establishment that consisted
of himself and his wife. In wealth, connections, and, above all, intellectual
compatibility, Salviati was another Cesi.I57 Galileo had him enrolled among
the lynxes.
On a summer's day in 1611, when Galileo was at Le Selve enjoying the fresh
air and an argument with two Pisan philosophers, the talk turned to the
nature of condensation and rarefaction. One of the philosophers adduced
ice as an example of a body heavier than water. The lynx pounced. Nonsense,

GALILEO
he said, ice floats on water. On the contrary, replied the philosophers, ice,
being a solid, is evidently denser; a chunk of ice floats because its broad flat
surface prevents it from cleaving the water. Nonsense again, said the lynx:
water has no resistance to the separation of its parts, as is plain from the facts
that a submerged piece of ice rises when released and the smallest particles
of mud settle, albeit slowly, to the bottom of a well. Water resists motion but
not parting. Whether a body sinks or swims depends solely on its specific
gravity.
Some days later Galileo learned that his tireless critic Ludovico delle
Colombe claimed to be able to show that a body that sinks when spheroidal
floats when formed as a lamina. He offered ebony as an example. Galileo
declared the demonstration invalid. He had had in mind bodies wetted by
water; a piece of ebony whatever its shape if once submerged stays sub­
merged. His adversaries refused the condition; they had exhibited a clear
case where shape determined buoyancy. The parties fought over the admis­
sibility of delle Colombe's evidence with the tenacity oflawyers in their own
cause. A showdown scheduled at Salviati's house fell through when Cosima
informed Galileo that, as a court ornament, he was not free to sparkle in
public arguments with noisy professors. It would be better, the grand duke
informed his former tutor, to write out your arguments and dispute on
paper.!" That enabled Galileo to turn a likely loss into a qualified win.
A contest by pen, Galileo wrote Cosima, would give him a great advan­
tage. The enemy would have to write too, and so either abandon or expose
their customary cavils, chimeras, distinctions, sophisms, and contradictions.
They had already abused the spoken word, he claimed, shouting from piaz­
zas, chiesas, gondolas, that he could know nothing of physics because he was
a geometer. But they did not know their man. They could no more "choke me
off and exterminate me from profaning [Aristotle's] sacred laws" than Arios­
to's savages could discipline Orlando for freeing the succulent maiden they
had reserved for their arc. And just as Orlando despised them as a bear does
yapping dogs, and killed thirty of them with ten blows of his telescope-or
rather sword-so Galileo, with no armor but the shield of veracity and the
protection of his prince, would dispatch "every madman who irrationally
assaults the truth."!"
Curious to know what had ignited his mathematician, Cosimo caused the
then new professor of philosophy at Pisa, Flaminio Papazzoni, to represent
the peripatetic position against Galileo in a debate before the grand-ducal

CALCULATED RISKS
179
family. Such performances often occurred after meals as a substitute for
television and Galileo was obliged by contract to participate in them when
requested. He then played his part of high-powered jester, answering ques­
tions put to him and defending himself as wittily as he could. As recreation,
postprandial disputes did not require a declaration of victory or an admission
of defeat. In the case before us, Galileo easily won-not because Pappazoni
was incompetent but because, as he owed his professorship to Galileo's rec­
ommendation, he had no interest in exerting himself."? Cosimo so enjoyed
this version of Androcles and the lion that he restaged it in the presence of
two visiting cardinals, Barberini and Gonzaga, who joined in the fun by sup­
porting, respectively, Galileo and Papazzoni. By then-October iô n+-Cali­
leo had developed enough material to make a little book and a theory general
enough to attack the peripatetic position on several fronts. Stricken again
with illness or hypochondria, he retired to Le Selve to write On floating bodies
(1612). It is an exemplary Galilean text. It secures a new neat Archimedean
result by applying pseudo-Aristotelian mechanics to hydrostatics; clutters
the application with repetitious geometry; introduces a sharp observation;
bases upon it a physical principle that literally does not hold water; throws
out hints at a non-Aristotelian physics; and spices the whole with references
to the idiocy of his opponents.v"
The crisp result concerns a prism of wood floating in a rectangular
vessel. Let the original level of the water in the vessel be I and the level after
immersion of the prism be II (Figure 5.6). Galileo's Aristotelian mechanical
principle is that the moment (weight x velocity) of the wood must equal that
of the water in any small vertical displacement from equilibrium. Press the

prism down a distance x; the water level simultaneously rises by y where
x: y = (A - a)(B - b): ab. If the motion takes place in the small time t, then,
according to the principle,
(weight of prism)(x/t)=(weight of water)(y/t).
Let the specific gravity of the wood be 8 relative to that of water taken as
unity. Then the preceding equation can be written
8(abc)x= (A-a) (B-b) (c-z)y,
where z = PQ is the height of the prism above the final water line II. After
substituting for x:>" we arrive at z = C(l - 8). Since in the case of wood, 8 < 1,
Z is positive and the prism floats. If 8 > 1, the body sinks. Period. Except that,
as delle Colombe showed, a flat ship of ebony will float although its specific
gravity is greater than 1.
The concise conclusion z = C(l - 8) has several implications besides sink­
ing or swimming. They may be seen more clearly in the unrealistic picture
Galileo drew of the situation (Figure 5-7), from which the inspiration for the
mechanical analogy he used leaps to the eye. Galileo portrayed the prism as
lying against three walls of the basin so that b = B and the problem became
two-dimensional. He conceived the water prism QO and the wood prism
PR as two weights in equilibrium; pressing down on PR raises QO, etc., and
of course leads to the relation PQ = C(l - 8) or c8 = C - PQ or, what we want,
PS . 8 = QS . 1. The only geometrical quantities in this equation are the heights
of the wood and the water: the log will float irrespective of its size and the
amount of water in the vessel provided there is enough to wet the wood and
to fill a prism of height QS and base OS that can be almost as thin as you
please. This is the celebrated hydrostatic paradox, which was (and is) useful

for lifting weights and astonishing neophytes. Galileo celebrated the paradox
in his usual subdued way as revelatory of "the causes of some admirable and
almost incredible events, as that a very small quantity of water may raise up
and sustain with its small weight a solid body that is a hundred or a thousand
times heavier,"!"
The celebrant called attention to another marvel implied by his analysis:
Archimedes made a mistake or, at best, claimed as general a principle oflim­
ited applicability. Only when the size of the floating object is negligibly small
compared with the width of its basin is it true that the volume of the body
immersed equals that of the water displaced. For in Figure 5.6, the displaced
volume IIQTI, which must equal the volume TURS of the immersed prism
below the original water line I, is evidently less than the total immersed
volume QVRS. But as the width of the vessel increases, as OS � 00, QT � 0,
I � II, and the displaced volume equals the volume immersed. At all times,
however, the weight of water that could be accommodated in the submerged
part of the solid equals the weight of the entire solid: QS = 8PS, aQS = a8PS,
Q.E.D.163 It appears that Galileo persisted in the same error as Archimedes
until he began his calculation and that discovery of the fault prompted him
to invent the analogy to the virtual motion of the lever, with which he always
felt comfortable.I'"
After these hors d'oeuvres, Galileo faced up to the question why ebony
chips can float. First answer, a quibble: such chips are not in water but on it;
if thoroughly wetted, they go to the bottom and stay there. Second, a paralo­
gism: a cone of wood or wax submerges partly whether placed base or apex
down on the water; hence water offers no resistance whatsoever to being
parted by any body of any shape. Third, a contradiction: water acts as if it
had a tough skin not easily penetrable by flat bodies of densities not much
greater than its own. This skin explains the behavior of the ebony chips.
Regarded closely, they lie in a little cradle, surrounded by ridges or banks
of water that rise above them to the average water level (Figure 5.8). What
contains and restrains the fluid in the ridges against its gravity? Galileo offers
no explanation: it is a fact. Likening the cradle and the chip to a ship and its
cargo, Galileo argued that the relevant specific gravity was that of the combi­
nation chip plus air. Thus we have flotation, in agreement with Archimedes'
principle.!"
To these ingenious speculations, Galileo added exercises in geometry to
bamboozle peripatetics who had skipped mathematics. Close observation

suggested that no ridge could be deeper than the depth a. What thickness x
of a piece of ebony of base A could such a cradle support? Or, as Galileo put
it, what is the ratio of empty to filled space in the cradle? Answer, (8 - 1):8.
He went on to investigate how the space and equilibrium changed with the
shape of the floated objects, notably cones, cones on cones, and so on, to the
admiration of the men of Galilee and the confusion of the pharisees.l" Car­
dinals del Monte and Capponi were enthusiastic; Cardinals Bellarmine, Deti,
and Gonzaga indifferent; the Paduan and Pisan professors foxed; Welser and
other loyalists pleased and perplexed until, after sufficient rereadings, they
had convinced themselves that Galileo had resolved all the paradoxes he had
started."?
In fact, Galileo had resolved little but unleashed a lot. Under his floating
bodies he put a medium that extruded objects of lesser density and parted,
without resistance, for objects of greater density. This was Calileo's first
published denial of levity and his hint in print at his new theory of motion.
He added a hint at an anti-Aristotelian concept of matter. Water is a pile of
atoms without mutual coherence or attachment, whence its ease of part­
ing. But just as detached persons in a crowd slow the progress of individuals
pushing through it, so the atoms resist the passage of bodies through water.
None of this accounted for floating ebony chips. To the end of his life Galileo
puzzled over the "obscure behavior" of fluids. Yet in the heat of the debates
of 1611 he affected to understand them well enough to subject them to geom­
etry. His opponents might not have understood the mathematics but they
got the message, and replied. Galileo was a category error, a mathematician
who had forgotten his place, a philosopher who did not play by the rules.
"Mathematical proofs and propositions cannot grasp the true cause of natu­
ral phenomena." "Those who want to demonstrate natural accidents through
mathematical methods are delirious." Not delirious mathematicians, delle
Colombe added, but sober philosophers, had the job of judging how to use
mathematics in physics.':"

CALCULATED RISKS
Galileo did not condescend to reply to his opponents under his own
name. Instead he provided the ammunition for a counter attack by Castelli
published in 1615. By then the battlefield had many fortified places. Castelli
required 18 salvos to answer 25 objections to Calileo's hints on atoms fired
off by a single opponent, Giorgio Coresio.!'" Although insignificant in their
detail, these maneuvers taken together had the important consequence of
increasing and hardening the opposition to Galileo in Florence and Pisa
already flourishing under the gentle heat of jealousy. His highly paid sine­
cure, charged on funds reserved to the University of Pisa from tax collected
from ecclesiastical holdings, excited envy and resentment among courtiers,
clerics, and professors.!" And his supercilious refusal to name his opponents
in his replies (to do them a favor, he said), his sending his squire to rebut
them, and his cocksure insistence that physics must bow down to mathe­
matics irritated even people inclined to support him. Campanella may speak
for all of them. Writing from his dungeon in Naples, he upbraided Galileo
for freighting floating bodies with propositions neither known to be true nor
easily defended, "so that you give your enemies an opening for denying all
the celestial things you pointed out ... 0 Dio what a pity it was to humble the
immense pride with which you could have gone forth so happily revealing to
mortals so many great things!"!"
Spots on the sun
As a facilitator in the Republic of Letters, Welser liked to put his friends in
contact with great men. In 1611 he sent Galileo an attempt by Georg Breng­
ger to lower the lunar mountains. It met a polite but firm refutation."? In
January 1612 Welser tried again with a more powerful challenger. He called
himself "Apelles" after the Greek artist who hid behind his paintings to hear
what viewers said about them. To answer this cautious contender, Galileo
embarked on an extensive new line of investigation that would change his
public persona from Assassin of Aristotle to Champion of Copernicus.
An adept mechanician, Apelles made himself a telescope of almost 30X.
In March 1611 he looked through it and heavy mist to measure the diam­
eter of the sun. He noticed what seemed to be spots on its surface but, not
wishing to injure his eyes, he put offfurther examination until he had lei­
sure, stained glass, and a colleague, Johann Baptist Cysat, fit for the purpose.
They resumed the observations in October 1611 to discover that the spots

GALILEO
moved slowly across the solar disk, changing shape as they went. When
plotted at daily intervals on a series of circles, they appeared to come into
existence (or into view), mutate as they moved almost in parallel lines, and
die (or disappear behind the sun) within two weeks or so. After satisfying
himself by astute tests that the spots were not artifacts, Apelles proposed to
explain them in a way that did least damage to the traditional cosmology!"
For Apelles was a Jesuit, Christoph Scheiner by name, professor of Hebrew
and mathematics at the Jesuit college in Ingolstadt, a clever man of 35 already
launched on a distinguished career (Plate 14). He would become the world's
expert on sunspots, an observer noted for his improvements in instrumenta­
tion, a useful theorist on light and vision, and an important Jesuit, advisor to
his general and confessor to a prince. To make a small world of it, Scheiner's
confessant was Archduke Karl Josef of Austria, a brother of Cosimo's arch­
duchess Maria Maddalena and of Calileo's admirer Archduke Leopold.":
Scheiner's first contributions took the form of three letters written in
November and December 1611. Welser published them in January 1612 with
a nice plate roughly depicting the spots on smallish circles representing the
sun. The size of these representations (almost all 2.5 em in diameter), which
had little space to indicate detail, supported Scheiner's suggestion, in keeping
with his obligation to stay close to Aristotle, that the spots were bunches of
tiny stars circulating around the sun. That would explain their coming to be
and passing away, their motion in roughly parallel lines, and, because of the
supposed opaqueness of the little stars, their appearances, which Scheiner
perceived as uniform darkness against white spaces. He thus assimilated the
spots to miniature Venuses, on the theory that Venus, if she revolved around
the sun like the spot starlets, would reveal the fact by showing herself near
inferior conjunction as a moving mark on the solar disk. In keeping with this
model, he expected that the sequence of spots would recur as the orbiting
starlets returned to the configuration in which he first sighted them. In an
inspired extension of the model, he guessed that the coming and going of
the Medici stars and the bumps on Saturn might also be owing to the antics
of starlets.I7S These conjectures did not please Galileo.
He took almost four months to reply to Welser as a client and to Scheiner
as a patron, that is, patronizingly. "It seems to me that Apelles, being of a
free and not servile mind and quite capable of sound knowledge ... cannot
yet totally free himself from those fancies previously impressed on him,"
that is, Aristotelian physics.':" Scheiner deserved a better reception from the

CALCULATED RISKS
sidereal messenger, as he had in effect founded sunspot studies; but Galileo
could not concede even that little. He believed that he had priority. He had
noticed them first, he told Welser, around November 1610. Perhaps he saw
them even earlier, for Micanzio recalled many years later that Galileo had
shown them to Sarpi before he left Padua; which, however, would not have
given him priority, since Gualterotti had described clearly, in print, a spot
he had seen without a telescope in 1604; Kepler did the same, mistaking a
spot he had observed in 1607 via a camera obscura for Mercury; and Harriot
had detected and followed many solar blemishes with a telescope in 1610, as
usual, however, without publishing them."? The first published telescopic
observations of the sun, the work of a German student using a Dutch gadget,
appeared in time for the Frankfurt book fair of 1611.178
The earliest secure date for Galileo's observation of sunspots is the spring
of 1611, when he showed them to people in Rome around the time that
Scheiner noticed their existence."? According to Calileo's game rules, it did
not matter when Scheiner first saw the spots or that he established some
of their properties before Galileo did. That gave him no priority. Why not?
Because he misinterpreted what he saw.!" The lion's share of the discovery
of the spots belonged to their first correct interpreter and, as we know from
Aesop, lions do not share.
The lion began his response without a roar, circumspectly, he wrote
Welser, because the notoriety of his previous discoveries had recruited a
band of implacable opponents. "For the enemies of novelty, who are infinite
in number, would attribute every error, even if venial, as a capital crime to
me, now that it has become customary to prefer to err with the entire world
than to be the only one to argue correctly." Still Galileo would hazard some
conjectures. Everything that Apelles wrote about the spots apart from their
existence was wrong. They are not dark, only less bright than the sun. There
is nothing star-like about them. And they might well reside on the solar sur­
face despite Apelles' argument that they cannot be carried around by a hypo­
thetical rotation of the sun. This last point was capital. Apelles had observed
that a spot that crossed the sun's disk without vanishing took around 14 days
to do so; if the sun did rotate, a hypothesis that Scheiner rejected, and if the
spin caused the motion of the spots, then the same ones should return to the
same positions once a month. They do not. Therefore ... Galileo replied that
the argument would be compelling if we knew that the spots were perma­
nent features. But we know they are not. Therefore ... 181

186
GALILEO
Poor Scheiner failed even in endorsing the great truth that Venus and Mer­
cury circle the sun. For he supposed that their transits might be visible as big
spots moving across the solar disk at speeds calculable from the planetary
models. In fact, Galileo wrote, they would be far too small to distinguish
themselves and-here is the point-no further proof of Venus' place was
needed beyond her display of phases as revealed by the sidereal messen­
ger. Venus travels around the sun as do all the other planets according to
Pythagoreans and Copernicans. If the spots are not star bunches, then what?
If there is anything they resemble within our experience, replied Galileo, that
thing is a cloud, which comes to be, passes away, expands and contracts, and
moves almost contiguous to the earth's surface. If we could look at the earth
from the sun, "and if the earth rotated on its axis," we would observe in the
clouds the phenomenon known as sunspots.l'"
Galileo concluded this first of his three portentous letters on sunspots
by giving another of his hostages to fortune. Apelles had had the effrontery
to suggest that the Medici stars resembled sunspots in their sudden appear­
ances and departures, and might therefore be only flights of starlets. It fol­
lowed that sometimes Jupiter might well show more than four (or perchance
no) satellites-Scheiner thought that he had found a fifth, which he named
after Welser-and that the other planets probably had companions now
and again too. Galileo countered that he had shown that each Medici star
had its own orbit and period. Next, Apelles tried to enroll Saturn among the
sites undergoing only apparent alteration. Saturn did not look three-bodied
to him, but like a soup tureen with lid and handles. Galileo assured Welser
that either Scheiner's eyes or his telescope had failed him. Calileo's own
occasional inspections showed absolutely no alteration in the appearance
of Saturn, "and reason itself, based on the experience we have of all the
other motions of the stars, can render us certain that likewise none will take
place." Galileo based this extrapolation on the supposition that any relative
motion among the three bodies should have been detected over the period
he had watched thern.!" It is a good measure of his self-image. He had come
to think that the revelations that God had reserved to him for ages could be
established definitively in a year and a half.
It was just this rapid pace that prevented him from writing the big book
on cosmology that everyone expected of him. Or so Galileo said in the
introduction to On floating bodies, in which, to show his ongoing participation
in astronomical discovery (and to claim his priority), he incongruously

CALCULATED RISKS
presented his first values for the periods of the Medici stars. When he sent On
floating bodies to press in March 1612, he had not pronounced in favor of the
cloud formations on the solar surface, or, probably, decided its capital rel­
evance to Copernican theory.!" Galileo continued to update his astronomy
via On floating bodies by inserting in its second edition, published in Autumn
1612, the bulletin that the spots adhered closely to the sun's body and were
"carried around by rotation of the sun itself, which completes its period in
about a lunar month-a great event, and even greater for its consequences."!"
The announcement of an unprecedented gyration of the sun in a book about
experiments with bits of ebony suggests and symbolizes the fruitful sym­
biosis between Galileo's ideas about terrestrial and celestial motion, and his
conviction that, in a few cases at least, he had discovered the physical truth
about astronomical bodies.
Support for the conclusion that the sun rotates came from observations
by Galileo in Florence, Cigoli in Rome, and astronomes as far away as Sicily
organized by Castelli. The group began its work in mid-February and kept at
it into August 1612. Their drawings, informed by knowledge of perspective
and practice with washes, rendered the ambiguous shapes of the spots more
like clouds than like the hard-edged opaque forms drawn by Apelles. Ideas of
the physical character of the spots developed with the methods of depiction.
Since the location of the spots was a matter of stellar importance, "[ artis­
tic] style was a carrier of knowledge of truly cosmic proportions." In early
May Galileo began to use Castelli's method of throwing the sun's telescopic
image onto a sheet of paper fixed to a board to make large scale maps of the
spots rendered in ink and wash. In contrast to Scheiner's 25 mm sun, Galileo
and Cigoli entered their observations on circles 125 mm in diameter, making
manifest the foreshortening at the limbs and allowing for fine shading else­
where. Gradually Galileo's and Cigoli's drawings for the same days became
very similar although they did not, as Galileo boasted in his second letter to
Welser, "fit exactly with mine."!"
In this second letter, Galileo argued from the thinning of the spots and
the shortening of the distances between them as they moved toward the
sun's limb that they must be on or near its surface. Taking, as he did, the
sun's axis as perpendicular to the ecliptic, a spot seen from the earth's
center would appear to move along a straight line AB parallel to the ecliptic
and perpendicular to the line of sight (Figure 5.9). By hypothesis, the spot
moves in fact along the semicircular arc ACB, so that when at X (or Y) it

appears at P (or Q), as in Figure 5.10. Now let the spot describe a circle of
radius b greater than the sun's radius a. Then by hypothesis it will be at X',
Y' when seen at P, Q. As b increases, X'Y' tends toward equality with PQ.
But XY > PQ. At any radius b > a, X'Y' < XY. The test is made most conven­
iently when the line of sight bisects X'Y' and XY, since the expected value
of XY can be calculated from the earlier measurements of P and Q (on the
assumption that the spots lie on the sun's surface) and compared with the
measured value ofX'Y'. The parallel or orthographie projection that Galileo
employed in this analysis was a staple in the theory of proportion.!" The
result of the calculation and comparison, Galileo claimed, ruled out spot
orbits with radii much different from a; but as the sample he gave contains
a small miscalculation, it might not have persuaded anyone who bothered
to work it OUt.188 Those who accepted the conclusion, however, and the
underlying premise that the sun turns on an axis through its center, gained
something. They had attained a new perspective on the universe.
The Coperniean theory does not merely exchange the positions of the sun
and the earth. It also endows the earth with the role previously assigned to
the sphere of the stars. A spinning earth? What could keep so sluggish and
heavy a body in motion? And the clouds, would they not be left behind, not

to mention birds and anything else not bolted down? To these objections
Galileo had no good replies before his study of sunspots. But now he had at
last an object that behaved exactly like Copernicus' earth, spinning on its axis
while describing its yearly Ptolemaic circuit, and leaving not a cloud behind.
To be sure, it was no proof, but it showed that, just as Jupiter's traveling with
the Medici stars strengthened the possibility that the earth could move with­
out losing the moon, nature could accomplish things undreamed of in Aris­
totle's philosophy!" Galileo gave the sun a little physics to help it move. Just
as a weight can rest or stray on a horizontal plane (that is, a spherical shell
concentric with the earth), having neither desire nor repugnance to a motion
that takes it neither toward nor away from the center, so the sun, a spherical
body, has no reason to prefer resting to spinning."? The spinning marble
sphere that Galileo had considered in his Paduan mechanics had become not
the earth but the sun.'?'
Galileo did not specify the origin of the impulse that set the sun spinning.
What counted was that the medium in which it revolved be sufficiently fluid
that the sun might continue to spin until God dissolved the world. Galileo
had just issued proof that water, and a fortiori the air and the interplanetary

190
GALILEO
medium, offered no resistance to parting. He had only to endow the heavens
with this yielding fluidity to persuade anyone who accepted the paradoxes of
OnJloating bodies that the sun can spin without meeting rcsistancc.!"
Galileo did not claim to be the first to melt down the solid spheres that
faithful Aristotelians like Cremonini invoked to portage the planets. Tycho,
whom as usual Galileo did not mention, had made the heavens fluid to
accommodate the comets he placed beyond the moon and the intersecting
orbits of the sun and Mars implied by his planetary system. Tycho was right.
Peripatetic philosophy was no more solid than its celestial spheres. Or so
Galileo wrote triumphantly to Cesi on 12 May, shortly after beginning his
large-scale solar mappings, "[sunspots] should bring about the funeral or
rather the extreme and last judgment of pseudo-philosophy." To Welser he
confided that the frequent creation and destruction discovered on the sun
signaled still another marvel to add to those he had found in the sky: the
obliteration of Aristotle's heavenly city.'?'
Meanwhile Apelles had corrected and extended his first hasty letters with
three more directed to Welser, who published them in September 1612. In this
More accurate inquiry into solar spots and Jupiter's stars, Scheiner again argued that
sunspots are shadows cast by dark matter, to which he now ascribed a slight
translucence to account for his more careful observations of the change in
shapes and play of shades as the spots crossed the sun's disk. Again he sup­
posed that the same dark matter came together and parted to create the
illusion of moons around Jupiter and lumps around Saturn; and he hinted
that moonglow, which he attributed to sunlight seeping through the lunar
body, indicated that our moon might also be made of it. By 25 July, when he
dated his sixth letter to Welser, he had read Calileo's first one. His balanced
response expressed pleasure that his observations agreed with those of a
"witness greater than all," the starry messenger. It also contained a lengthy
account of sources of observational error, admitted the earth among reflect­
ing bodies, and called for a new cosmology incorporating the dark matter he
supposed to fly around the planetary systern.'?'
Galileo had Scheiner's More accurate inquiry before him when, on 1 Decem­
ber 1612, he sent Welser the last of his sunspot letters. His friends Cesi and
Cigoli had advised him to go easy, which he did, to spare Welser.'?' Still, he
allowed himself a jab at Apelles and at philosophers in general for preferring
the authority of thousands to the "spark of reason in a single individual"
who saw that the spinning sun confirmed Copernicus.':" That went too far

CALCULATED RISKS
191
for Welser, who shrank from publishing Calileo's letters to him ostensibly
because of the expense of reproducing the large drawings in their original
size. Cesi was happy to take on the task, however, and to edit as well as to
publish Galileo's contributions to solar physics. Editing involved negotiating
with the Inquisition over certain passages and in negotiating with Galileo to
tone down his rhetoric. Cesi took particular care with the engravings, about
which he consulted Cigoli; and Calileo's handsome book, Istoria e dimostrazi­
oni intorno aile macchie solari (Observations and demonstrations concerning sunspots)
came from the press in 1,400 copies, half of which also contained Scheiner's
letters to Welser."?
The title and language are significant. Unlike Sidereus nuncius, Observations
on Sunspots was not merely an account of the phenomena (istoria) but also
an indication of the true character of the universe (dimostrazioni).198 And
unlike the earlier work, the Letters appeared in the vernacular, in answer to
Cigoli's plea for works accessible to people unpracticed in academic Latin
and to the great inconvenience of their most interested reader, Scheiner,
who did not know Italian. The choice of language shifted the grand drama
of the solar spots from the European stage to Galileo's theater of opera­
tions. Making philosophy accessible to young Italians who think that
"those miserable [Latin] pamphlets that contain great new things ... remain
way over their heads" was but one of Galileo's objectives in writing in the
vernacular.!"
It was as well that Scheiner did not understand the preface that Cesi saw
fit to add to Calileo's Istoria. It breathed the fire of the small devoted band
of impressionable liege men (Cesi, Stelluti, and Angelo de Filiis, the lynxes'
librarian and author of the preface) eager to promote their champion Gali­
leo over all others. The horned Venus, lobed Saturn, spotted sun, the instru­
ments for discovering them and the ability to interpret them, "all this was
reserved for Signor Galilei alone." He had been as one against the multitude.
At first he met denial and rejection, then envy and jealousy; he and only
he, guided by God and Nature, had the "firmness of judgment, perspicacity
of discourse, integrity of mind, [and] nobility of spirit" to have brought the
novelties to light, all of them, on his own.ë" And this formulation of the case
was a shortened and softened version of de Filiis' original draft, which even
Galileo could see would give unnecessary offence.'?'
Galileo chose Welser, newly lynxed in 1612, as the recipient of the
announcement of a double marvel: a new production in the heavens and a

192
GALILEO
mistake by GaWeo, "an unexpected wonder ... which has recently come to
disturb me."202 Despite Calileo's assurances, Saturn's fortunes had changed
drastically: he was now again solitary. Should the enemies of reason take
heart? Galileo predicted that the strange and unexpected event would be
undone after the winter solstice of 1614 (as it was) and that, no less than
Venus' phases, it "agrees in a wondrous manner with the harmony of the
great Copernican system, to whose universal revelation we see such favora­
ble breezes and bright escorts directing us, that we have little to fear from
darkness or crosswinds." Apparently Galileo assimilated Saturn's blobs
to Jupiter's moons and estimated their period from the interval between
his first view of them and their disappearance. Calculation of the date of
their reappearance involved the relative motions of the earth and Saturn as
well as the supposed period of the blobs and so related to the Copernican
system.ë"
Just before this declaration of faith, as he was objecting to Scheiner's appli­
cation of the word "stars" to spots, Galileo recalled the lunar explorer Astolfo.
The connection he made was a far-fetched allusion to the stars, in this case to
the eyes of the evil sorceress Alcina, who had the bad habit of turning disused
lovers into myrtle trees. That was Astolfo's plight when Ruggiero, dismount­
ing from his flying horse on Alcina's island, stopped to chat with him. The
siren came to Ruggiero that evening, wrapped in nothing much and smiling
through "joyful twinkling stars" that made him feel as if hot sulfur coursed
through his veins. Fortunately he had an antidote to her meretricious paralo­
gisms. He had Angelica's ring, the Ring of Reason, with which he disengaged
himself after a most enjoyable evening. Escaping from Alcina and her peri­
patetic followers, Galileo-that is Ruggiero-ran to the far side of the island,
where her sister, a rival sorceress, cultivated sound philosophy.-v'
5.4 FAMILY AFFAIRS AND FORMER
FRIENDS
Family affairs
Knights-errant travel light. Galileo divested himself of his daughters as soon
as they became nubile. In 1613 he placed them in a nunnery of the Poor
Clarcs in Arcetri just outside Florence, where they would spend the rest of
their lives. It had not been easy-not because the separation pained him

CALCULATED RISKS
193
particularly, but because the girls did not meet two principal criteria for
perpetual incarceration. For one, they were under age; for another, they were
sisters. He could solve the problem of age by placing the girls first as board­
ers. The prohibition against establishing natural siblings as religious sisters
in the same monastery could only be set aside by dispensation from Rome.
Through his contacts with cardinals including the reliable del Monte, and, it
is said, the decisive intervention of Castelli, Galileo obtained his dispensa­
tion. After three years of monastic life, at the age of 16, Virginia took her
vows and the name Maria Celeste (Plate 9); Livia did the same, a year later, to
become Suor Arcangela.?"
Galileo did nothing unusual in disposing of his children. The cost of mar­
rying off two illegitimate daughters to families good enough for a grand
ducal philosopher would have been prohibitive. Galileo may well be criti­
cized, however, for not allowing them to investigate and choose their con­
vent, as his new friend Barberini recommended to a niece contemplating the
contemplative life. Galileo did not have Barberini's means, but he had a good
income and was almost or entirely out of debt when he had to place the girls.
He had shown himself generous, overly generous, in providing for his sisters.
Very likely the Poor Clares recommended themselves because its abbess, the
sister of Calileo's friend Belisario Vinta, pressed Galileo to have his daugh­
ters take the veil during her term of office. Life among the Poor Clares was
hard. Virginia, who had a calling for it, passed to a better one at the age of
33. Livia, who chafed under monastic discipline, had to bear it longer. She
outlived her father, who left her a very small legacy to buy some comfort in
her last years.?"
Galileo was no misogynist. He thought that women could be as intelli­
gent as other people. "Women have excelled in every art I in which they've
carefully taken part." Thus Ariosto, praising women's ability at arms as well
as with the pen, preparatory to describing Astolfo's adventures with some
Amazons. Galileo did not try to develop his daughters in either geometry
(which, since it defeats many, can stand for war) or poetry, although while he
was considering a convent he had the example of Margherita Sarrocchi, who
exceled at both, before him.?" That was a pity since at least one of the girls,
Virginia, had a talent as a writer now obvious to everyone.ë" The monastery
was the easier option. Galileo made it available not only to his daughters but
also to his great niece, Virginia Landucci, who thanked him most fulsomely
for it. But then she did not choose the Poor Clares."?

194
GALILEO
The story of this niece well illustrates the mix of generosity and hard­
ness in Galilee's character. He had maintained a poor girl, Anna di Cosimo
Diociaiuti, in a convent. When his nephew Vincenzo Landucci proposed to
marry Anna, Galileo agreed to continue her subvention of 6 scudi per month
to help support the couple. He did not want to continue it after Anna died
in 1633; but Maria Celeste, who supervised the payments, allowed them to go
on as charity to the Landucci family. When she died in 1634, Galileo stopped
the money; whereupon Vincenzo, as litigious as his father, sued and won on
the ground that Galileo had encouraged the marriage and had a responsibil­
ity for the consequences. A few years later, Galileo converted the debt by
paying Landucci 50 scudi down and defraying Virginia Landucci's convent
costs. That was an entirely satisfactory solution to him. As we know, the
maintenance of poor girls in nunneries or through dowries was an estab­
lished form of charity,"?
Marina Gamba did not live to see her daughters settled. She died in 1612.
Galileo then prepared confusion for historians by placing his son Vincenzo
with a married woman named Marina. Lorenzo Pignoria made the arrange­
ments and acted as a conduit for Florentine scudi for the boy's care and Vene­
tian pills for Galileo's pains. Vincenzo was to do well in life. Legitimized by
Cosimo, educated in medicine at the University of Pisa (thus fulfilling his
grandfather's plan for his father), Vincenzo became a responsible Florentine
citizen, and, less successfully and noisily than his father, a man of science and
letters. He would be a comfort to Galileo in his old age."! In that he differed
from his uncle Michelangelo, who continued to drain Calileo's resources. It
will cost you nothing to help out your brother, Michelangelo wrote in 1611,
recalling that he had promoted Galilco's glory by advertising the sidereal dis­
coveries around Munich."! He did not appeal in vain.
Among the inconveniences Galileo could not leave behind was his poor
health. He was ill for most of the winter 1610/11 and again in the summer
after returning to Florence from Rome.213 What was his problem? His friends
advised him to cut down on wine (none except with meals said Cigoli, only
with moderation added Sagredo and Castelli), and no doubt overindulgence
in food and drink did its damage.?" Whatever the cause of his recurrent
fevers, depressions, pains, and palpitations, they altered his physical appear­
ance. The Venetian ambassador to Rome, Simone Contarini, who had
known Galileo during Paduan times, was struck by the deterioration in his
appearance when they met in 1615. Contarini linked the evident decline in

CALCULATED RISKS
195
health with an increased apparent religiosity. "He frequently takes the sacra­
ments and is very much changed from what he was."215 The probable etiol­
ogy of this increased observance will soon be clear.
The only member of his extended Venetian family who relocated near
Galileo was his quasi-son and disciple Benedetto Castelli, who had left
Padua in 1607 for a teaching post from which he developed the first Galil­
ean apostolate. "My students venerate Your Lordship's rare virtues, which
are unique in our time." We know Castelli's enthusiasm over Sidereus nun­
dus and his suggestion about the phases of Venus. His place, as he saw it,
was with the celestial messenger. He requested a transfer to the Benedictine
abbey in Florence."? He arrived there in April 1611 and immediately made
himself useful in compiling data about the Medici stars. Soon he was help­
ing to meet objections to On floating bodies and to draw the trajectories of
sunspots. In 1613, he became professor of mathematics at the University of
Pisa, where, in time, he had Vincenzo Galilei and two of Galilee's nephews
as students, and trained two excellent mathematicians in the Galilean cause,
Bonaventura Cavalieri and Evangelista Tor ic ell i. 217 The post gave him access
independently of Galileo to the Tuscan court. In 1626 Castelli entered the
service of the Barberini as advisor on hydraulics to the pope and tutor to
one of the papal nephews. Despite his many successes as administrator and
expert, Castelli tended to sell himself short where Galileo was concerned. "I
know very well that everything I am I am through you and the reputation I
have of being your disciple.'?"
Old friends
Cremonini and Galileo at first stayed in touch through Paolo Gualdo,
whose reports may reflect his taste for practical jokes. In May 1611 Gualdo
wrote that Cremonini spoke most affectionately about Galileo though pre­
paring to publish a treatise De caelo ("On the heavens") against him. Gali­
leo replied expressing feigned trepidation, to which Cremonini answered
that he had no need for concern since the new De caelo would not mention
his discoveries. According to Gualdo, Cremonini refused to look through
a telescope. This behavior, made famous in Galileo's later lampoons, has
become the trademark of the purblind philosopher. But Cremonini's rea­
son for not trusting the telescope was that he had looked through one. The
image confused and dizzied him. He inferred that only people with quirky

GALILEO
eyesight and unrestrained imagination could see what Galileo had claimed
to see."?
In any case, for Cremonini as for many others, Galilee's observations could
not make an effective challenge to Aristotle's physics. Cremonini reduced
the epistemology at stake to a single question. If the moon is a big rock, what
keeps it from falling down? Aristotle's system might be wrong, and Cali­
leo's observations indicated problems in it; but unless Galileo could provide
a physics adequate to account for standard phenomena, the inconvenient
evidence from the telescope would remain just an inconvenience. No astro­
nomical system, including Ptolemy's, satisfied Cremonini's strict demand
for a science of first principles.?" Galileo appreciated the difficulty raised by
Cremonini, which amounted to finding the physical principles on which to
anchor a demonstratio potissima of the Copernican system. He could not do
it. And without a replacement for Aristotelian physics he had no chance of
bringing philosophers with him. "Yea verily [wrote Campanella], you cannot
philosophize without a true and confirmed system of the constitution of the
universe. We [it is Campanella in papal mode] expect Your Lordship to pro­
vide one.'?" Philosophers will not leave one bone until tossed another.
Cremonini's solution to the problem of a realistic astronomy, which was
to reassert Aristotle, brought him once again to the active attention of the
Inquisition. Revisions were required to his De caelo; the pope, still Paul V,
demanded to see the revisions before publication and ordered Bellarmine
to dictate to the Venetian inquisitor the sorts of corrections required. Cre­
monini procrastinated. A new pope, Gregory XV, a friend of the Jesuits,
was less patient than Paul. He ordered that all Cremonini's writings be
placed on the Index, but his decisiveness did not bother or deter the errant
philosopher.i" While scrutinizing Cremonini, the Holy Office did not
overlook his friend Galileo. During his visit to Rome in 1611, the Inquisi­
tion, alerted perhaps by Bellarmine to errors in faith that might arise from
the new discoveries, decided by formal decree to see whether "Galileo
Professor of Philosophy and mathematics ... is named in the case against
Dr. Cesare Cremonini."223 "Oh, how much better Galileo would have done
[Cremonini sighed to Gualdo] if he had not taken up these caprices and left
the freedom of Padua."?"
Where a new idea appears in Galileo's writings it is wise to look for it in
Sarpi's notebooks. Fra Paolo had considered the problem of solar fuel before
Galileo took it up in connection with sunspots. Following a Stoic idea, he

CALCULATED RISKS
had likened the sun's physical economy to the burning of oil by a lamp.>»
Galileo thought that the spots might be the food, if not the excrement, of
solar consumption, and spied the food's provenance in the planets. Sunspot
activity appeared confined to a narrow band around the ecliptic, which sug­
gested an exchange of solar light for planetary exhalations. This ingenious
theory, proposed in the third letter to Welser, did not make it into the printed
edition of Observations on sunspots, which had problems enough without it in
passing the censorship.?" Galileo did not drop the idea, however. He coupled
the notion of a material bond between sun and planets with the discovery
of the solar spin to obtain the motive power to sweep the planets around.
Apparently he had in mind something like Kepler's anima motrix, by which
the turning sun drives the planets as the beams from a lighthouse would
ships-if the beams were made of steel. 227
Galileo informed Sarpi early in 1611 of his latest findings: the phases of
Venus and their implication, the discovery of a way to obtain the periods of
the Medici stars, the unchanging appearance of Saturn and his companions.
The signs in the Roman sky, as he read them, were favorable. The Jesuit math­
ematicians, "forced by the truth ... have confessed and admitted everything."
Among the holdouts, the most obstinate were the philosophers of Padua,
that is, their mutual friend Cremonini and his followers. Continuing in this
paranoid or melancholic vein, Galileo feared that the philosophers would try
to "exterminate mathematics" at Padua, that they would choose a cipher as
his successor, "so that if ever something beautiful and true were discovered,
it would be suppressed by their tyranny.'?" Sarpi answered through Mican­
zio: what you have done is very fine, but enough; stop fretting and return to
your important work, which is perfecting your (our?) science of motion."?
A satisfactory theory of motion would challenge received physics at its core.
There was where the principles of a new philosophy lay. To Sarpi, who con­
tinued to ask after him, and to Gualdo, Sagredo, and other Venetian friends,
Galileo's Copernican campaign was a quixotic sideshow,"?
From the Venetian point of view, the ongoing celestial discoveries weak­
ened the case for them all. Was there not something almost magical and
even dishonest about this incessant revelation of distant things?"! Certainly,
they enriched the range of hypotheses for academic discussions; but they did
not establish heliocentrism as a demonstrated realistic theory to be foisted
on philosophers and theologians. In its state and the world's state, it was
not worth a major fight with the duplicitous occupants of the Vatican. Sarpi

GALILEO
acted on this conviction in 1616. At the time, Venice was at war with Austria
and Sarpi had several works in hand demonstrating the machinations of
the papacy, including his devastating History of the Council of Trent, published
anonymously in England in 1619, and an exposé of plots against Venice by
Rome.232 So in 1616, when the Congregation of the Index condemned cer­
tain Copernican works, Sarpi advised that, stupid as it was, the Serenissima
should accept it. It did not threaten the Venetian printing industry or any­
thing else with a significant constituency. "Since so few people apply them­
selves to astronomy, there is no reason to fear a scandal.'?" Galileo and Sarpi
were no longer in touch.
Sagredo could not understand his friend's fancy for Florence any more
than he could his Copernican compulsion. "Where will you find freedom and
self determination as in Venice ... ? Serve your prince [if you will]; but here
you had command over those who order and govern others, and you did not
have to serve anyone but yourself, as if you were monarch of the universe."
At court jealousy is always ready to tear down virtue. "Who knows what
the unfortunate and incomprehensible accidents of this world can effect?
Especially when exploited by the deceits of evil and envious men who sow
and cultivate false suspicions in the mind of the prince,'?" Though hurt by
Galileo's desertion, Sagredo maintained his end of their weekly correspond­
ence. The letters are jovial, licentious, scientific, gossipy, and opinionated.
The friends exchanged gifts, medicine, plants, objets d'art from Sagredo, dogs,
wine, and sausages from Galileo. They discussed heat, thermometry, lenses,
telescopes, magnetism, comets, and the calculation of Easter.:" And they
assassinated characters. Two of Sagredo's judgments are arresting. Kepler
was not as good a mathematician as Galileo, indeed, not good enough for
a call to Padua; and "Della Porta has the same place [among the learned] as
church bells among musical instruments.'?"
Sagredo's death in 1620 cut Calileo's last material tie to Venice. It was in
any case as fragile as glass. Galileo had dropped his mechanic Mazzoleni as
brusquely as his mistress Marina, and had to depend on others to procure
Murano glass for his telescopes. He does not seem to have installed in his
dwellings in and around Florence any of the grinding machines he had in his
house in Padua but depended largely on Sagredo for finished lenses."? Most
of the artisans Sagredo commissioned were mirror makers or polishers of
pietra dura by trade and had neither the skill nor the interest to develop reli­
able techniques for freeing optical glass from twists and blemishes. Yields

CALCULATED RISKS
199
were low. In a representative try, a friend of Sagredo's cast 300 lenses, of
which he deemed 22 suitable; of these Sagredo took only three and none of
them was perfect. He then commandeered a glassworks and tried to forge
lenses of rock crystal. In optical properties they outdid glass but the yield of
good ones was if anything poorer. Often the best lenses came from broken
pieces of mirrors. From these Sagredo fashioned opera glasses, which, he
said, made women short distances away look more beautiful. Fuzziness has
its uses. Galileo tried in vain to attract specialists from Murano to Florence.
Cosimo did better. He obtained a few to run the glassworks he set up in 1618,
which also kept Galileo supplied with lenses. It appears that he had a busi­
ness in telescopes for twenty years or more after leaving Padua.?"
The petty court jealousies of which Sagredo had warned Galileo may be
illustrated by a spat between Salviati and a low-level Medici over whose car­
riage had precedence. The Medici won, the insult stung, and, despite attempts
at mediation by Christina and cardinals Bandini and Barberini, the quarrel
smoldered for over three years until in January 1613, in the presence of the
grand duke, the teapot tempest petered out. Toward the end of the year,
having patched up his relations with the court and nursed Galileo through
the writing and publication of the Observations on sunspots, Salviati set off to
see the world. He went first to Venice, where he may have met Sagredo, and
to Padua, where he talked at length with Cremonini, who again expressed
his affection for Galileo, "except in theory." He then took ship to Spain. The
country did not agree with him. He died suddenly in Barcelona in 1614, not
yet 32.239

Galileo's published attacks on traditional physics worked most powerfully
and transparently where they destroyed distinctions between celestial and
terrestrial affairs. Sidereus nuncius and the Letters on sunspots integrated the
earth into the heavens and earthed the heavenly bodies: the moon's surface
copied the earth's with rocky irregularity, the sun's atmosphere ours with
intermittent clouds; Venus showed herself as opaque as the moon, and Jupi­
ter more earthy than earth in the number of his satellites. The distinction
between a heaven made of incorruptible perfectly spherical bodies imbed­
ded in frozen quintessence, already weakened by earlier detection of novas
and comets without parallax, now could survive in its original purity only
in minds not authorized to think for themselves. On floating bodies, which
did away with levity and reduced the list of factors relevant to buoyancy to
a single entry, specific gravity, was to terrestrial physics what Sidereus nuncius
was to cosmology.
Although obliteration of the distinction between celestial mechanics and
terrestrial physics destroyed the wall on which the traditional world picture
hung, it did threaten the structure of received religion in principle. It did so in
practice, however, owing to the interdisciplinary fusion of Catholic doctrine
with Aristotelian philosophy sanctioned by the Council of Trent. The upper
hierarchy of the church had been trained in this fusion, and many of the men
still in charge in 1615, notably Bellarmine and Paul V, were rigid defenders of
Tridentine dicta and papal prerogatives. Still, squabbles among the professors
that did not touch on matters of faith generally did not excite the censors;
and just as Platonic and other deviant philosophies escaped without official
200

MISCALCULATED RISKS
201
censure, so, no doubt, the great questions of the fluidity of the heavens and the
rockiness of the moon would not, in themselves, have commanded the urgent
attention of the Holy Office.
What aroused its vigilance was the effort to make Copernicanism the
framework of an alternative world system. The challenge of the sun-centered
universe to the traditional cosmos was not the heart of the matter, although
no doubt it meant much to people who had professed the old way for decades.
Nor was the Copernican geometry the main point: only mathematicians had
cared about the ways in which astronomers arranged orbits, spheres, epicy­
cles, equants, and eccentrics in their calculations. What concerned the Holy
Office was the formal opposition to a stationary sun extracted from such
passages in scripture as Joshua 10:12. Why should a man informed by God
command the sun to stand still if it had not been moving? But even this con­
sideration might not have forced the issue had not some volunteers, includ­
ing Galileo, undertaken to twist the plain words of scripture to allow, and
even to favor, the sun-centered universe. The volunteers ignored a primary
decree of the Council of Trent. "In matters of faith and morals pertaining to
the edification of Christian Doctrine, no one, relying on his own judgment
and distorting the Sacred Scriptures according to his own conceptions, shall
dare to interpret them contrary to the sense which Holy Mother Church, to
whom it belongs to judge their true sense and meaning, has held and does
hold, or even contrary to the unanimous agreement of the fathers."
6.1 FREELANCE EXEGETES
Galileo was alerted to opposition to his as yet unpublished Copernicanism
during his wooing of the Jesuits in 1611. The future lynx Welser, peering from
Augsburg, knew that Galileo had been talking up Copernicus in Rome. He so
informed Gualdo, who in turn warned Galileo: "Your actions are observed
minutely, and are being published around the world." Galileo understood that
his enemies might push theological objections to heliocentrism and wrote
Cardinal Carlo Conti, whom he had met in Rome, for an assessment of the
significance of the scriptural argument. The cardinal answered that a heaven
subject to destruction fit the bible better than eternal hard quintessence; a
spinning earth presented few problems, a revolving one and a stationary sun
many more. Conti advised Galileo not to force the issue.' There were other

202
GALILEO
opinions. "IfI were God I would not suffer such a race of human ignoramuses
[as your enemies] to live," Galileo's former student Daniele Antonini, now
well launched on the military career that would cost him his life, wrote from
his barracks in Brussels. "I guess that the dear Lord permits them to act as
buffoons for mother nature." Galileo settled on putting his Letters on sunspots
through the press shielded by Conti's powerful scriptural argument for the
corruptibility of the heavens.
Despite Cesi's standing in Rome and his impeccable religiosity, he could
not obtain permission to publish the Letters as Galileo wished. Galileo wanted
to begin with Jesus' rebuke to those who have ears but have not heard, "the
Kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force" (Mat­
thew 11:12). The application to world systems was too transparent. Galileo
responded to the censors by removing the biblical context and tried, with
success, the paraphrase, "Already the minds of men assail the heavens, and
the more valorous conquer them." Galileo wanted to claim "divine good­
ness" as the ground of his success; he had to settle for "favorable winds."
That was the easy part. Galileo desired also to argue that the bible agreed
better with Copernicus than with Aristotle or Ptolemy. On these points the
censors refused to negotiate. Although Cesi had strengthened the argument
that the bible favors a corruptible heaven with passages from scripture and
the fathers, he had to concede. Scripture could not be mentioned, nor Conti's
argument.' The Letters on sunspots consequently came out without scriptural
confirmation of the Copernican confession with which Galileo ended them.
The censors did not object to the confession. They were not concerned with
astronomical systems but with biblical interpretation.
Hermeneutics in Florence
The matter of the compatibility of Copernicus and the bible returned, in a
manner Galileo believed he could not ignore, late in 1613. Just after taking up
his professorship at Pisa, Castelli received a friendly admonition from the
archbishop-overseer of the university not to "enter into opinions about the
motion of the earth, etc." To which Castelli replied that he planned to fol­
low the example of his master Galileo, who had not mentioned it during 24
years of teaching in Pisa and Padua. The reassured archbishop allowed that
if Castelli wished he could touch on similar questions as "probable.'? A straw
in the November wind. A month later the new professor lunched with the

grand ducal family and, among others, a Pisan philosophy professor, Cosimo
Boscaglia. The conversation turned to Jupiter's moons. Christina muttered
that they had better be real. To be sure, she had seen them in the heavens
and also on earth, in the form of four Florentine gentlemen who played the
Medici stars in an extravaganza held in 1612 in honor of the Duke of Urbino,"
Nevertheless, she entertained doubts because Galileo linked his discoveries
to Copernicus' possible heresy. How could anything be true that implied
false doctrine? Christina asked Boscaglia for his opinion. The philosopher
replied, to the whole table, that the new phenomena were genuine, and to
Christina, privately, that the Copernican implications were worrisome. After
the meal Christina summoned Castelli to her rooms. Cosimo, Maria Madd­
alena, Boscaglia, and Galileo's supporters Antonio de' Medici (a natural son
of Francesco I and his second wife Bianca Capello) and Paolo Giordano II
Orsini (a future patron of Scheiner) also attended. Christina put the case that
scripture rendered the earth's motion impossible. Castelli in reply "play[ ed]
the theologian with ... finesse and authority .... Only Her Ladyship contra­
dicted me, but in such a way that I thought she was doing it in order to hear
me [out]." Boscaglia remained silent. Antonio de' Medici assured Castelli of
his good will toward Galileo. The tale appeared to have a happy ending."
Thinking that his disciple might again be called upon to defend the faith,
Galileo sketched out a general method of meeting biblicist objections to the
conclusions of "sensory experience and necessary demonstrations." The
method would become standard Catholic hermeneutics long after he had
suffered for proposing it.'" Many scriptural passages are silly, Galileo wrote
Castelli, even blasphemous if taken literally, like those assigning God arms
and legs, and all-too-human emotions. In such cases another interpretation
should be sought. The same consideration applied to the bible's occasional
observations touching natural phenomena; and in these cases, where "sen­
sory experience or necessary demonstrations" can settle the facts, the testi­
mony of scripture "should be reserved for the last place." We must keep in
mind that the Holy Spirit accommodated its message in the Old Testament
to the limited capacities of an ignorant people. Today, however, a few people
are clever enough to use God's gifts to see things as they are. "I do not think
it necessary to believe that the same God who has furnished us with senses,
language, and intellect would want to bypass their use and give us by other
means the information we can obtain with them." To place scripture first in
matters not pertaining to faith is foolish as well as "disorderly." It incurs the

204
GALILEO
risk of binding faith to assertions about the physical world that may turn out
to be false."
If God made the world heliocentrically, Catholic exegetes better informed
about the world system than Hebrew savages should be able to interpret
biblical references to astronomy more plausibly on Copernicus' model than
on Ptolemy's. "It being obvious that two truths can never contradict each
other," the Joshua story correctly understood convicts Aristotle's cosmol­
ogy of falsity and absurdity. Really? Well, according to the Greeks, the sun's
diurnal motion is caused by the rotation of the sphere of the stars. Arrest­
ing the sun could only stop its annual motion; and that, being from west to
east, could only shorten the day created by the sphere rotating from east to
west. And if God had stopped the sun while allowing the stars to continue to
move, He would have altered the relationship between sun and stars forever.
In Galilee's Copernican world, however, God could shut down the system
and prolong the day by stopping the earth's spin without introducing any
confusion when normal operation resumed.'?
This accomplished hermeneutics revealed that Joshua's words could
have been spoken by a Copernican biblical literalist and that theologians
would not require supernatural insight to reinterpret standard texts. Gali­
leo accepted that a satisfactory interpretation was both possible and nec­
essary, for he believed as surely as Bellarmine and the majority of Catholic
exegetes of their time that every statement in scripture is in some sense
true. Although the Holy Spirit had to talk down to reach Moses' unedu­
cated masses, unlike many popularizers He never descended to patent
untruths. As humankind progresses, the correct meaning of His utter­
ances gradually comes to light. "The Lord is subtle but not malicious."!'
Owing to God's decision not to confuse the bible's moral message with
an exposition of the world system, the efficient philosopher investigates
nature without reference to scripture. After efficient philosophers and
mathematicians have arrived by sensory experience and necessary dem­
onstrations at true propositions, an authorized exegete can reinterpret the
bible and hail its unveiled teaching as confirmation of the true proposi­
tions. Thus, having demonstrated that Joshua 10:12 indicated a Coperni­
can universe, Galileo appealed to Joshua 10:13 ("the sun stood still in the
midst of heaven") to confirm the central position of the Copernican sun.
To the believer, this circle was not vicious. It brought together two truths
that had to be one."

Like many men of science, Galileo did not bother with administrative
matters. Who was to work out the correct exegesis when philosophers and
mathematicians had determined that the literal word of God could not be
defended? Certainly not the man of science eager to assert his independence
from scripture! The crux, as Borro and Cremonini had maintained, was to
separate philosophy from theology and keep them apart. That was Galileo's
goal too. But as he thought he knew some truths about nature, he could not
forebear to show how the bible should be read when it conflicted with them.
His concordist effort in effect redid the Thomistic synthesis with different
ingredients and, in so far as he practiced it, returned Galileo to the prison
from which the argument for independence might have freed him."
Calileo's Letter to Castelli came into the possession of a group Galileo
derided as "the pigeon league" because Ludovico delle Colombe ("of the
doves") helped energize it. Among its members were several Dominicans
including Ludovico's brother Raffaelo, the leading preacher in town. The
delle Colombe brothers, who together represented the interdisciplinary Tri­
dentine ideal, had been antagonists of Galileo since Ludovico had opposed
him over the nova of 1604. In 1610/11 they struck both philosophically and
theologically. Ludovico proved the immobility of the earth on physical prin­
ciples and Raffaelo declared, on mere principle, opposition to novelties of
all kinds and the inquisitiveness that created them. "They are the most dan­
gerous expressions of human pride." Among the instances he mentioned
were Galileo's old lectures on Dante, then still occasionally discussed at the
Accademia Fiorentina. Not even Hell was safe from the unwholesome curi­
osity of mathematicians."
Truly unwholesome. The speculations of mathematicians are a sort
of drunkenness. "[They] cannot grasp even close-up and very simple
things ... What is clearer than Deus firmavit orbem terrae qui non commovebitur,
and still the Copernicans say that the earth moves ... Therefore if he who
drinks the wine of the science of the world does not temper it with what
is written, Aqua sapientiae salutaris potabit illum, he will fall into delirium and
madness."? Did anyone in Florence know a drunken, delirious, crazy astron­
omer? Raffaelo gave the answer himself, from the pulpit in the Florentine
Duomo. The madman in question claimed to see spots in the sun. "Did not
the ancients say of a man who seeks defects where non exist, Querit maculam
in sole? The sun has no blemish, nor does the mother of the sun, the Virgin
Mary,":"

The informal pigeon league had the important support of the Archbishop
of Florence, Alessandro Marzi Medici, of Don Giovanni de' Medici, and, prob­
ably, of the Grand Duchess Christina. The archbishop and the grand duch­
ess also conspired in the wider project of strengthening clerical influence
in the grand duchy by eroding the power of patrician officials like Vinta."
Among the clerics they favored the Dominicans Niccolo Lorini, a familiar
figure around the court, and Tommaso Caccini, an ambitious preacher, who,
though only 35, had been a hound of God for almost 20 years. (Plate 12). He
took on Galileo in 1611, perhaps at the suggestion of his patron the Arch­
bishop. Tornmaso's yapping bothered his brother Matteo, the head of the
Florentine House of Caccini, more than it did Galileo. With the help of the
Salviatis and Maffeo Barberini, Matteo managed to get his noisy brother out
of town for a while. Egged on, probably, by Raffaelo delle Colombe, and in
any case unrestrainable, Tommaso returned in 1614 to deliver the Advent ser­
mons in Santa Maria Novella."
Having decided on his own that the propositions of a moving earth
and standing sun were heretical, Caccini gathered what evidence he could,
including the Letter to Castelli, that Galileo and his disciples believed them
and, indeed, many things worse. His research methodology featured eaves­
dropping. One day he overheard a private discussion between a student
of Galileo's, a young Florentine noble named Giannozzo Attavanti, and
a Dominican master, Ferdinando Ximenes, who instructed Attavanti in
casuistry. They were discussing in the hypothetical mode whether God is
substance or accident, and whether He has human senses and emotions. Lis­
tening at his spy hole, Caccini heard enough to infer that Attavanti held the
opinion he defended hypothetically (an accidental, sensual, emotional God)
and had learned it from Galileo. On a previous occasion, Caccini had heard
Attavanti and Ximenes discussing Copernican theory. He had then rushed
into Ximenes' cell and declared, "it was a heretical proposition to assert that
the sun stands still and its center does not move." He further declared that
he wanted to preach about it." He took the book of Joshua as the text for his
Advent sermons. When he arrived at Joshua 10:12, he barked at Copernicans
for promoting a theory in flagrant contradiction to Holy Scripture."
Caccini's virulent sermon made a scandal. The Dominican General wrote
Galileo to apologize; so did Lorini; and Matteo blasted Tommaso in terms
that can only be used between brothers. You fake religion and zeal to cover
your animosity, Tommaso. Or was the attack your idea? "How thoughtless

MISCALCULATED RISKS
207
you have been to let yourselfbe taken in by those pigeons, or idiots, or doves!"
You have ruined your reputation. "A grave mistake! A gross stupidity!'?'
Matteo redoubled his efforts to remove Tommaso from Florence. He need
not have bothered. Exactly a month after his nasty sermon against mathema­
ticians and Galileists, Tommaso Caccini showed up in Rome to testify before
his fellow Dominican, Michelangelo Seghizzi, the Commissary General of
the Holy Roman and Universal Inquisition. He deposed as follows. "With
the modesty which befits the office I hold," he had preached to the multi­
tude that the Copernican view was "discordant with Catholic faith," indeed,
heretical, as it ran counter to the opinion of all scholastic theologians and
all the Holy Fathers. "After this discussion I counseled them that no one was
allowed to interpret divine scripture in a way contrary to the sense on which
all the Holy Fathers agree.'?" Asked by Seghizzi about Calileo's reputation
regarding matters of faith, Caccini replied, "[by some] he is regarded with
suspicion in matters of faith because they say he is very close to Fra Paolo,
of the Servite order, so famous in Venice for his impieties; and they say that
letters are exchanged between them even now." Galileo also corresponded
with people in Germany, as did other members of an academy he belonged
to, a further indication of his unreliability."
Caccini knew more, and worse. Galileo's letter to Castelli contained "ques­
tionable doctrines in the domain of theology." Some Galileists believed that
God was an Accident and that the saints had not worked miracles. Pressed
by Seghizzi for his sources, Caccini replied that Galilee's Copernicanism was
notorious in Florence and could be found in his book on sunspots, and that
Attavanti (Caccini could name no other) was the misled Galileist. As for the
Castelli letter, Caccini volunteered that he had seen a copy in the possession
of Lorini, from whom he had learned about Galileo's ongoing correspond­
ence with Sarpi. 26 Lorini had not neglected to inform the Roman authorities
about the Castelli letter. Early in February he sent a copy of it to the Domini­
can prefect of the Congregation of the Index, Cardinal Paolo Camillo Sfron­
dati, for delivery to the Inquisition. That was only to do his duty, he said, to
act as a hound of the Holy Office. All of his brothers at S.M. Novella who had
read the letter agreed that it contained many rash or suspect propositions,
to wit: Holy Writ sometimes speaks inappropriately; scripture holds last
place in disputes over natural effects; biblical exegetes often err; scripture
pertains to faith and nothing more; and "in questions about material phe­
nomena, philosophical or natural argument has more force than the sacred

208
GALILEO
and the divine one." Unpardonably, like so many Protestants, the Galileists
want to interpret scripture in their own way. "They speak disrespectfully of
the ancient Holy Fathers and St Thomas." "They trample underfoot all of
Aristotle's philosophy, which is so useful to scholastic theology." All true. So
evident were Galileist errors and pretensions that Lorini felt no need to add
more. "As St Bernard said, [in Rome] the holy faith has lynx eyes.'?'
Knight-errantry in Rome
The Holy Office sent Lorini's version of the Letter to Castelli to a consultant,
who saw nothing that "diverge[ d] from the pathways of Catholic expression"
except three short phrases in the Castelli letter, two of which must have been
written by a negligent or malevolent copyist, as they are much stronger than
Galileo's wording, and the third of which offers to "assume and concede"
Joshua 10:12.28 The inquisitors perceived that Lorini might not have sent a
faithful copy of the letter and wrote to Florence for one. Since the original
was less damaging than the copy, it seemed that the storm might subside if
the parties stayed calm." Galileo opted for a pre-emptive strike. He asked
Piero Dini, then serving in the Vatican bureaucracy and living with his car­
dinal uncle, Ottavio Bandini, to forward correct copies of the Letter to Castelli.
"The most immediate remedy would be to approach the Jesuit Fathers, as
those whose knowledge is much above the common education of friars."
After all, Galileo wrote, he strove to save uninformed decision-makers
in Rome from falling for the frauds of his detractors; his motive was not
personal but patriotic. Surely the Jesuits would help him to overcome the
"wickedness and ignorance of my opponents." Galileo always had trouble
distinguishing the ignorance of his opponents from their wickedness. To set
them right, he was putting the finishing touches on a formal statement of his
hermeneutical methods and conclusions, which would circulate as a letter to
the Grand Duchess Christina. 3D
The Jesuits declined to come to the rescue. Grienberger saw something
sophistical in Galileo's reasoning and Bellarmine doubted that humankind
could reach truth in astronomy. He did not foresee a ban against the Coper­
nican theory, he told Dini, but, perhaps, a directive to regard it as a hypoth­
esis, that is, a useful fiction. Early in his career, Bellarmine had concocted a
cosmology from the bible and the fathers, the only way, according to him,
to reach truth in the matter. A stationary sun seemed irreconcilable with the

MISCALCULATED RISKS
209
bible. The most difficult text for Copernicans, he confided in Dini, was the
beautiful psalm that begins, "The Heavens declare the glory of God." The
difficulty follows a few lines later: "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the
sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as
a strong man to run a race." Dini replied that the Galileists could interpret
it favorably. Bellarmine urged restraint. No one should rush to conclusions,
he advised, and offered to read whatever Galileo had to say. "As you can see,
things are rather unclear because everyone is on guard about a business of
such importance." Dini returned to giving copies of the Castelli letter to
friendly cardinals including Barberini and del Monte."
Bellarmine's apparent flexibility increased Galileo's missionary zeal. He
replied to Dini that Copernicus would not have labored so valiantly to dem­
onstrate a mere hypothesis. He thought his system true and we, who have
even better reasons to believe it than he did, should either accept it as true
or probable, or dismiss it altogether. Furthermore, it is nonsense to say, as
Bellarmine did, that because astronomers employ concepts like eccentrics
and epicycles all their constructions are fictions. For epicycles, interpreted as
orbits around a body other than the earth, do truly exist, as we can deduce
from the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. As for eccentrics, Mars'
path around the earth most certainly is not geocentric for the planet is twice
as distant at conjunction with the sun as at opposition." This clever and mis­
leading response, which implicitly takes force-free epicyclic rotation as the
principle of planetary motion, helps explain why Galileo could not accept
Kepler's ellipses.
There remained Bellarmine's prize text. To neutralize it, Galileo devel­
oped the celestial physics he had begun with his paradoxical identification
of sunspots as excrement and continued in his explanation of Joshua's mira­
cle. We know from Genesis that God made light before he made the sun to
be its vessel. From the sun and the universal background radiation left over
from the initial fiat lux, all bodies in the universe obtain their fertilization
and growth, and the planets have their principle of motion. The bridegroom
running his course is the radiating sun, which, like a bridegroom, is eager to
fertilize, rejoicing in his power of penetration ... To reduce the offense of this
exegetical caricature, Galileo followed the advice of Roman friends to qualify
it, and his essays in theology generally, as conjectures submitted to higher
authority with "the humility and reverence due to the Holy Church and all
its very learned fathers, whom I respect and honor and to whose judgment

210
GALILEO
I submit myself and everyone of my thoughts." In practice, however, most
of the higher-ups were ignoramuses. Hence God had sent Galileo for their
instruction. "Divine love may sometimes deign to inspire humble minds
with a ray of His infinite wisdom, especially when they are full of sincere
and holy zeal.'?'
Prophets do not deal in hypotheses. Not for them the magic spell of the
four-letter talisman, the tetragrammaton HYPO, which converts a true, manly
thesis into a tranquilizing hypothesis. Only the uninformed or the malevo­
lent could think that Copernicus' theory was a hypothesis. Moreover, taking
heliocentrism to be hypothetical demeaned the human mind as perfected
in mathematician-philosophers. When by sensory experience and necessary
demonstration they reach certainty, they cannot amend their convictions;
"it is not within the power of the practitioners of demonstrative sciences to
change opinion at will." Exegetes must give way. They can change their inter­
pretation; the philosopher cannot change nature." If they ducked these plain
facts, Bellarmine, Grienberger, and the rest would desert the truth as well as
Galileo.
On 7 March 1615, the very day on which Dini reported that everyone,
including Bellarmine, was stepping gingerly around the Copernican ques­
tion, Cesi sent Galileo a pamphlet that prompted its premature resolution. Its
author, Paolo Antonio Foscarini of Venice, was Principal of Calabria for the
Carmelite order and a professor of theology then lecturing in Rome. He was
also the author of an encyclopedia. Putting together its section on cosmol­
ogy, he had recognized that Copernicus might have been closer to the true
system than Ptolemy. Further thought, closer acquaintance with Galileo's
work, and the mistaken idea that all lynxes were Copernicans, convinced
him that heliocentrism was probable and that the church might err griev­
ously by condemning it. Like Galileo, he wrote to protect the church from
itself. Unlike Galileo, he believed that a close reading of scripture could reveal
the truth about the natural world. He was a true concordist." Had he only
known how to derive the Copernican theory from the bible! He contented
himself with the lesser task of showing that every known biblical passage
apparently opposed to heliocentrism could be construed either neutrally or
in its favor.
Like Galileo, Foscarini exploited the principles of accommodation and of
priority (demonstrable science has precedence in matters not touching faith
and morals) and, as Galileo would do, ran into trouble specifying usable tests

MISCALCULATED RISKS
211
for propositions amendable to demonstration. Cesi rated Foscarini's Letter­
the pamphlet had the form of a letter to the General of the Carmelites-a
timely godsend, "unless," he added, "it be harmful to increase the anger of our
adversaries, which I do not believe." He decided to bring out a Latin edition
with more passages and construals that would convince everyone. "[ Coperni­
eus'] opinion will be permitted and approved so fully that anyone who wants
to hold it can do so freely, as in matters that are only physical or mathemati­
cal." Other lynxes urged caution." Although Foscarini presented his views
with due humility and in the spirit of charity, the Tridentine decrees applied
more directly to his published Letter than to Galileo's semi-private musings.
Moreover, Foscarini was a monk subject to discipline. His letter required an
answer.
Galileo had Foscarini's pamphlet with its rich citations to Augustine and
other saintly exegetes before him when revising his wordy, worthy letter to
Christina." Very likely he was familiar with the arguments, since the theol­
ogy of Sarpi's circle inclined toward the Protestant elements in Augustine's
thought. So prepared, and appealing to the military spirit of the devout duch­
ess, Galileo presented the struggle over Copernicus as a battle between good
and evil. The pigeon league and birds of similar feather, ignorant, incompe­
tent, embittered, obstinate, self-interested, vindictive, malicious men, unable
to wield the instruments of science, that is, disciplined observation and nec­
essary demonstrations, have drawn "an irresistible and fearful weapon," the
sword of scripture. 38 Against them stand diligent philosophers, acute mathe­
maticians, famous exegetes, and the good, holy, fair-minded fathers in Rome
who, with the help of God and Galileo, will guard the church from reckless
condemnation of the truth." Citing authorities from Augustine to Trent, and
emphasizing that Copernicus had had the support of popes and bishops,
Galileo tried to convince Christina that the church would expose itself to
mockery and its sacred documents to scorn if it opposed truths obtained by
properly ascertained natural knowledge."
In astronomy especially, scripture cannot stand up to "sensory experi­
ence and natural demonstration" (SEND). The writers of the Old Testament,
which contains all the passages to which cowardly philosophasters and the­
ologasters appealed, did not see fit even to mention any planet but Venus.
The sluggish sun of Joshua and the bounding sun of David were not intro­
duced to instruct moderns in cosmological theory. Similarly the unanimous
agreement of the fathers, who never considered carefully the constitution of

212
GALILEO
the world system, weighs nothing against SEND. To declare the Copernican
version heretical on the basis of their accumulated obiter dicta would be a
usurpation of the prerogative of popes and councils to declare heresies as
well as a gross and ridiculous error." All of which Galileo submitted to those
to whose superior judgment on matters so far from his profession he was
always ready, he said, to defer."
In order to gain a fair hearing for his application of his exegetical princi­
ples, Galileo made the damaging concession to Christina that when SEND
did not hold, when the reasons given for a particular physical proposition
are only probable, then the literal reading of scripture should prevail." On
this test, Joshua should trump Copernicus; for, although SEND established
essential and growing support for Copernican theory, it gave no unimpeach­
able proof. Nonetheless, in Galilee's reckoning, Copernicus trumped Joshua.
The resolution of the contradiction lies in an equivocal distinction between
propositions likely forever to elude SEND (whether stars are animate) and
those likely at some time to submit to it (whether the earth moves). Galileo
gave no criteria for deciding to which category a given case belonged. The
distinction was less a guide to epistemologists than a sop to theologians;
and, unintentionally, a demonstration that the SEND test set a standard higher
than Galileo's cosmology could reach. However, he could reinterpret biblical
passages to agree perfectly with Copernican theory, indulging in the sort of
paradoxes he loved, and he ended his letter to Christina with his compromis­
ing explanation that Joshua lengthened his busy afternoon by stopping the
spinning of the earth."
Fatal interdiscipline
The unidentified censor to whom Foscarini's letter went for review found
that it "excessively favors the rash opinion" of Copernicus, allows it probabil­
ity though it contradicts the obvious meaning of scripture, twists the sacred
texts, "and explains them contrary to the common explication of the Holy
Fathers, which agrees with the more common, indeed the most common,
and most true opinion of almost all astronomers.":" The charge of rashness
greatly offended Foscarini, who dug three senses of "rash" from standard
theology and showed that none of them applied to him. He reemphasized
that the bible spoke to common people and that the Fathers knew nothing
about astronomy. He protested, exactly on target, against hitching scripture

MISCALCULATED RISKS
213
to secular ideas that might prove false. "[I]n matters pertaining to the sci­
ences acquired by human effort, no one ought to be so addicted to a philo­
sophical sect, or to defend some philosophical opinion with such tenacity,
that he thinks that the whole of sacred scripture should henceforth be under­
stood accordingly ... Therefore we should not be so tenaciously committed
to the philosophy of Aristotle or to Ptolemy's world system ... Nor should
the passages of scripture be interpreted according to the meaning of these
philosophies only.":"
Foscarini sent a copy of this sensible defense and of the original letter to
Bellarmine, who replied in his kindly, tough-as-nails way, and signed himself
"as a brother." He congratulated Foscarini and Galileo on their prudence in
speaking about Copernican theory only as a hypothesis, as he thought that
Copernicus had done. (We should regard this praise as Bellarmine's advice
rather than his belief.) To interpret it as true would be very dangerous, "not
only because it irritates all the philosophers and scholastic theologians, but
also because it is damaging to the Holy Faith by making the Holy Scrip­
tures false." The septuagenarian Bellarmine followed this opening shot with
a fusillade that showed, if nothing else, that the Curia should have a man­
datory retirement age. He argued as if his opponents were the Protestants
against whom he had done battle in the previous century. The Council of
Trent had forbidden interpretations contrary to the consensus of the Holy
Fathers. "Ask yourself then how could the Church, in its prudence, suggest
an interpretation of scripture which is contrary to all the Holy Fathers and to
all the Greek and Latin commentators." It will not do to say that their agree­
ment about matters irrelevant to faith and morals does not count. There are
no such matters in scripture. Every word is an article of faith, if not in sub­
stance then by source. "Thus anyone who would say that Abraham did not
have two sons and Jacob twelve would be just as much of a heretic as some­
one who would say that Christ was not born of a virgin.":"
From this frozen fundamentalism Bellarmine thawed to admit that should
SEND of the earth's motion and sun's rest ever be found, the church would
have to proceed cautiously in interpreting the apparently opposed scrip­
tural texts. However, no such demonstration existed. "And in case of doubt
one should not abandon the sacred scriptures so interpreted by the Holy
Fathers." Did not Solomon himself write, "The sun rises and sets, and returns
to its place," Solomon, "inspired by God," and also wiser than anyone else in
the human sciences? "All this wisdom he had from God."48 Foscarini planned

214
GALILEO
a reply but did not live to deliver it. Death took him unaware, in 1616 or 1617,
only two-sevenths of the way through the encyclopedia that had stimulated
his contribution to the Copernican cause.
Although the Holy Office conducted its business in secret, Galileo did not
have to guess that it took an interest in him. On its orders, the Archbishop
of Pisa asked Castelli for a correct copy of Galilee's letter and admonished
him, for his own good, to give up belief in the earth's motion. "Overcome by
such benevolence [Castelli wrote Galileo], I could do no other than reply that
I was eager to comply with his suggestions, and that it only remained for me
to accommodate my mind to the reasons that I might hope [to receive] from
his profound wisdom and sound learning. He took for me but a single reason
from his stock ... : since all created things are made for the service of man, it
clearly follows as a necessary consequence that the earth cannot move like
the stars ... He went on to say ... that it was soon to be made known to you
and His Serene Highness and to everyone that these ideas are all silly and
deserve condemnation."?
This bulletin roused the bull. Galileo's friends directed him to keep his
mouth shut. Cesi: do not try to vindicate yourself against Caccini, hold your
peace about Copernicus; Bellarmine thinks that the theory is heretical since
the earth's motion opposes scripture. Barberini: be more cautious, do not
stray beyond physics and mathematics, allow theologians their territory,
give no opening to the enemy. Anything you say will be distorted, the car­
dinal said; you put mountains on the moon and soon people say you put
humans there too, and ask how they could have arrived on the ark." Grien­
berger: prove the earth's motion before trying to square it with scripture."
Ciampoli: relax, your enemies though noisy are few. Galileo could not relax.
He longed to rout the obstinate, instruct the ignorant, and slaughter the
slanderous. "[B]ut my mouth is shut and I am ordered not to go into the
scriptures." It was unreasonable, intolerable! "This amounts to saying that
Copernicus' book, accepted by the church, contains heresies and may be
preached against by anyone who pleases."? Galileo suffered this frustration
until November 1615, when, perhaps having wind of the Florentine inquisi­
tors' interviews of Ximenes and Attavanti, he gained Cosimo's permission to
go to Rome to "defend himself against the accusations of his rivals." Cosimo
behaved throughout the affair more as an indulgent and supportive friend
than as a prince concerned about his standing. He directed his ambassador
in Rome to accommodate Galileo, a secretary, a valet, and a small mule. His

secretary, Curzio Picchena, wrote the superintendent of the Medici Villa,
Annibale Primi, that Galileo was to have everything he needed for his mis­
sion and wanted for his wellbeing."
The lesser and the greater mule arrived in Rome on 10 December 1615 to
the annoyance of Ambassador Guicciardini. He knew that Galileo meant
trouble. Galileo had stayed with him for a few days in 1611 while celebrating
with the Jesuits and (Guicciardini recalled) alienating consultors and cardi­
nals of the Holy Office. Bellarmine had told him at the time that if Galileo
stayed much longer the Inquisition would have had to take a position about
his opinions. To Guicciardini's good advice that he lower his profile and
expectations, Galileo had paid no heed then. Now the stakes were higher.
"I do not know whether he has changed his mind or his attitude, but I do
know that some Dominicans prominent in the Holy Office and others think
ill of him; and this is not a place to come to dispute about the moon or, at
this time, to uphold or bring new ideas.'?" Galileo had not changed. At 52
he was more obdurate than ever, impatient, and dismissive of advice; "he is
fired up over his opinions, and has a passion about them that he lacks the
strength and prudence to curb." Rome would not be taken by so mad an
Orlando. "The Prince here [still Paul V] abhors literature and these clever
ideas, and cannot listen to novelties or subtleties." Almost everyone, the
sympathetic and informed as well as the ruthless and ignorant, followed the
pope's lead."
Galileo had two goals in mind. One was to exculpate himself from charges
of impiety and recklessness; the other, to demonstrate that his opinions were
not erroneous. Towards exculpation, he brought with him the potent stain
remover of Cosimo's testimonial to his character. "I know him well," Cosimo
wrote the cardinal nephew Scipione Borghese, "he is a good man and very
observant and zealous in religion." No one could doubt the sincerity of a
courtier so close to a pious prince. Cosimo appealed to Cardinal del Monte
to introduce Galileo to "intelligent and discreet people" to whom he could
demonstrate his "correct and pious intentions.t'" That required many visits
to cardinals and other important individuals, and the increased expression
of religious sentiment noticed by the Venetian ambassador. Galileo bore the
fatigue with the help of the "loving care" of Superintendent Primi and the
prospect of "securing and increasing my reputation."? Early in the new year
Galileo could report that he had penetrated the snares set for him by his per­
secutors. A month later he could announce that he had finished his first task:

216
GAll LEO
the people who counted now recognized his "frankness and integrity" and
the "diabolical malignity and iniquitous intention of my persecutors.':"
There remained the bigger task, shouldered "as a zealous Christian and
Catholic," the task of saving the church from the serious error into which
prelates deceived by Galileo's enemies might lead it. He promised himself
a threefold increase in reputation when he succeeded. 59 His method was
the Ancient Mariner's. He talked and kept talking, brilliantly; he took on
all comers, like a chess master playing a dozen opponents simultaneously,
or like a cat among pigeons. He played with and humiliated his victims by
sharpening their arguments apparently to invincibility before annihilating
them. God Himself assisted in these parlor tricks. "I am consoled in seeing
how much the blessed Lord enjoys the integrity and purity of my mind."
"I trust in God that, as he gave me the grace to uncover the frauds of [my
enemies], he will give me the means to foil them, and prevent any decision
that would bring scandal to Holy Church."? An eyewitness to these perform­
ances, Galileo's old friend Querenghi, probably spoke for many in admiring
Calileo's manner while rejecting his message. "Outside the world of these
mental fireworks, we can stand firmly in our place without flying away with
the earth like ants on a rising balloon."?'
Pressed by both friends and adversaries for a demonstration that would
make the Copernican world plausible to them, Galileo wrote out early in
January 1616 the kinematical theory of the tides adumbrated in Sarpi's note­
books for 1595. When in his extremity Galileo had to deliver a proof of the
Copernican theory, he could proffer one that had passed the scrutiny of Fra
Paolo." Galileo's "Discourse on the tides" has the form of a letter to Alessan­
dro Orsini, who then was about as old as the theory and a cardinal of exactly
18 days standing. Apparently Galileo could not enlist any of the senior car­
dinals he cultivated to receive and disseminate this demonstratio potissima.
Untested but enthusiastic, Orsini undertook to explain to the pope that the
tides are to the seas what sloshing is to water in a barge, if the earth-barge
sails on a Copernican itinerary."
If the inquisitors saw Galileo's sloshbucket tidal theory, they were not taken
in by it. It agreed neither with received philosophy nor with the physics Gali­
leo had invented to treat sunspots (clouds rotating with the sun) and earth
spin (the atmosphere turning with the earth). The theory could not account
for observations of tides in particular places because of the complexity of the
secondary causes. In fact, it misfired altogether, as it seemed to work as well

217
without as with the annual motion. On Galileo's reckoning, the spin alone
introduced a disparity of motion between any pair of diametrically opposite
points on the earth's equator. The annual revolution merely picked out one
particular diameter-that along the line from the sun to the earth-against
which to reckon the "acceleration." It was, moreover, a very peculiar accelera­
tion as it required a sea bottom to suffer the "curious effect of having its parts
moving at different speeds at different hours of the day."?' But in his emer­
gency, Galileo clung to his and/or Sarpi's theory and, as was his wont when
challenged, never gave it up.
Galileo ended his discourse on the tides with a pungent and even bitter
reference to its purpose. What would happen if Copernicus' "hypothesis,
previously corroborated only by philosophical and astronomical reasons
and observations, were declared fallacious and erroneous by virtue of more
eminent knowledge"? Obviously, the discourse on tides would be declared
null and void. There would then be three paths to follow. The eminent
authorities could demonstrate where the discourse failed philosophically
and astronomically; or they could say that the matters treated were among
those God wanted to keep secret; "or, finally and more advisedly, remove
[me] from these and other fruitless inquiries.'?" The stakes were high. Young
Orsini went on his mission. Paul sent for Bellarmine. They decided that
Copernicanism was erroneous and perhaps heretical. 66
The eleven theologians empanelled by the Holy Office to evaluate
Copernican theory returned their unanimous verdiet on 24 February 1616
after five days of deliberation. They judged the assertion that "the sun is the
center of the world and completely devoid of local motion" to be "formally
heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy
Scripture, according to the literal meaning of the words and according to
the common interpretation and understanding of the Holy Fathers and the
doctors of theology." The proposition of the earth's motion qualified for
the lesser censure of "at least erroneous in faith." Moreover, the proposi­
tions failed, this time equally, to conform to the world system to whieh
the theologians had yoked their doctrine. " [They are] false and absurd in
philosophy."? There was no room in this formidable interdiscipline for
a salutary opposition between science and religion. The consultors had
no reason to ponder the accommodationist argument: in their view, the
findings of philosophy concurred perfectly with the results of traditional
exegesis."

218
GALILEO
The cardinals of the Holy Office accepted the advice of their consultors.
The pope thereupon ordered Bellarmine to warn Galileo to abandon his
opinions; if he should not accede to this friendly warning, Bellarmine was
to issue a formal "precept" or injunction against him "to abstain completely
from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing
it." If he did not acquiesce to the injunction, he would go to jail. The follow­
ing day, 26 February 1616, Galileo appeared before Bellarmine and Seghizzi.
To the confusion of subsequent history, the unsigned minute describing the
interview does not agree with the papal order. Bellarmine duly warned Gali­
leo that the "abovementioned opinion" conflicted with scripture and advised
him to abandon it. Then, before Galileo could express his voluntary acqui­
escence, Seghizzi proceeded, succesive et incontinenti, to the second step and,
before Bellarmine and other witnesses, "ordered and enjoined the said Gali­
leo ... to abandon completely ... the opinion that the sun stands still at the
center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach,
or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing." Galileo accepted
the injunction and agreed to obey it.69 He had no attractive alternative.
It was easier to condemn Copernican work than to acquaint the faithful
with the news. The Index of Prohibited Books came out irregularly, at long
intervals; the latest edition available for consultation in 1616 was Clement
VIII's of 1596. The right to publish interim condemnations belonged to the
Master of the Sacred Palace (as chief censor in Rome) and to the Secretary of
the Congregation of the Index. The first to act in 1616 was the master, whose
order, printed but never published, concerns only three items: Foscarini's
Letter, banished outright for its attempt to show that Copernican ideas "agree
with the truth and are not contrary to scripture"; Copernicus' De revolutioni­
bus and a commentary on Job that interpreted the verse, "[H]e shaketh the
earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble," in a Copernican
sense, suspended "until corrected.'?" The order mentions neither heresy
nor Copernican works in general. The Congregation of the Index persuaded
the pope to suppress the master's version in favor of a sterner prohibition.
Its decree disposes of the three items on the master's list as he did; bans all
books teaching Copernican theory; and refers to the offending doctrine as
"the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture.'?'
The Congregation of the Index announced this ruling-the only official doc­
ument concerning the decision of 1615/16 published at the time-on 5 March
1616.72

219
Cardinal Bonifazio Caetani's assistant Francesco Ingoli, who had dis­
puted publicly with Galileo in 1615/16 and earned appointment as consultor
to the Holy Office for his performance, received the assignment to purge
Copernicus. He recommended leaving the core of the work intact despite
its reliance on the earth's motion because of its utility for calendrics, and
cleansing it for Christians by crossing out passages where Copernicus
spoke of his hypothesis as a "theory" or otherwise asserted the truth of
his system. The Congregation of the Index received Ingoli's recommenda­
tion in 1618 and, after the mathematicians of the Roman College had signi­
fied their approval, published them in 1620. They did not become generally
available before the publication of the second edition of Clement's Index
in 1624.73 It appears that only Italian owners, and not all of them, marked
their copies as ordered. The entire business shows an enviable faith in the
effectiveness of the verbal distinctions beloved in the schools and in con­
fessional disputes. Anyone could read the corrected condemned doctrine
and anyone but Galileo could discuss it, in principle, provided only that he
called it a hypothesis."
Copernicus' De revolutionibus may have been the first book devoted almost
100 percent to what we would call science to be condemned, even tempo­
rarily, by the Congregation of the Index. Earlier, natural science had been
hit sometimes as parts of books banned as magic, divination (necromancy,
geomancy, fatalistic astrology), or heresy (mortality of the soul), or in books
judged obscene (gynecology), or in writings by proscribed authors (Protes­
tants), but only as collateral damage." Since the condemnation of Coperni­
cus would not only break new ground but also ban a book permitted for 70
years, Galileo thought he had reason to believe that his reason would pre­
vail. He misjudged the fleeting conjunction of personality and doctrine in
the Rome of Paul V. He also neglected the lesson of his own experience. Of
the twelve Catholic authors of books touching natural knowledge who were
questioned or detained by the Inquisition before 1616, Galileo knew or just
missed knowing at least half: Borro, Bruno, Campanella, Cremonini, della
Porta, Giulio LibrU6
Ambassador Guicciardini informed Cosimo about the failure of Galileo's
mission. "Everyone feared that his coming here would be prejudicial and
dangerous."? And everyone perceived the failure after the publication of
the decree of the Index-everyone except Galileo, who represented it as a
justification of his efforts to serve the church. Caccini and his followers had

220
GALILEO
labored to have Copernican theory declared heretical; Holy Church decided
on the lesser fault that it disagreed with Holy Writ; Galileo had won. Only
Foscarini was banned. Copernicus' book would lose a few phrases where it
claimed compatibility with Scripture. "I am not mentioned, nor would I have
gotten involved in [the business] if ... my enemies had not dragged me into
it." Galilee's behavior throughout had been exemplary; "a saint would not
have handled [the affair] with greater reverence or with greater zeal toward
Holy Church." Saints spend time wrestling with the devil. On this score Cali­
leo too could claim sainthood. "My enemies ... have not refrained from any
machination, calumny, and devilish suggestion.":"
Five days later Galileo wrote home again. He had had a long audience
with the pope. "Timid with equals, ungrateful to benefactors, supercilious
with inferiors, and passionately fond of money," Paul V had orchestrated
the inquiry into Galileo's beliefs, ordered Galileo alone among mathemati­
cians and philosophers to receive instruction directly from Bellarmine, and
persecuted Galileo's friends Cremonini and Sarpi." Galileo applied to his
persecutor for protection. Paul replied that neither he nor the Holy Office
would listen to slanders and that, as long as he lived, Galileo could feel safe."
The unheeded slanders continued and rumors that Galileo had been disci­
plined or made to recant started up. Castelli and Sagredo wrote in alarm. In
response, Galileo did something prudent. He applied to Bellarmine for a cer­
tificate of good standing. Bellarmine generously wrote that Galileo had not
abjured or received penance, but was informed that the Copernican theory
"is contrary to Holy Scripture and therefore cannot be defended or held."
Perhaps this certificate, which has become famous, was as much a favor to
Cosimo (Bellarmine was a Tuscan) as to Calileo."
The decisions of 1616, though not enlightened, were not immoderate.
The misfortune for the church was that the pope, Bellarmine, and doubtless
others at the Holy Office believed that they had to act. From their Tridentine
perspective, Calileo's attempt to set up an independent school of cosmology
and biblical criticism looked like the budding of a new head of the Protes­
tant hydra; and (to stay in the animal kingdom), once the pigeon league had
pecked out the danger, the thought police had to look into it. A coincidence
decided the timing of the showdown: the simultaneous activity in Rome of
Caccini, unburdening himself to the Inquisition, and Foscarini, trying to pre­
vent it from heeding him." The consultants to whom the Holy Office sub­
mitted the question of the tenability of Copernican theory had little leeway

MISCALCULATED RISKS
221
in their considerations. We can appreciate as inevitable their qualification of
a stationary sun and moving earth as absurd in philosophy. That was pre­
cisely what Galileo thought. But whereas the consultants foisted the absurd­
ity on Copernican theory, Galileo placed it on Aristotelian philosophy. Had
the expert consultants and their inquisitorial clients only understood the
direction of the argument, they could have achieved the uncoupling of the­
ology from philosophy desired as heartily by the Borros and Cremoninis as
by the Galileists.
The promiscuous use of the charge of heresy by the Roman hierarchy,
on which Sarpi liked to dwell, confused the status of Copernicanism as
decided in 1616. The consultors to the Holy Office went too far in qualifying
as "formally heretical" the proposition that the sun does not move unless
they meant no more by it than "contrary to the literal meaning of scripture."
They had no power to declare any belief heretical. Neither did the cardinals
of the Holy Office, who ought to have struck out the reference to heresy in
their consultors' report before adopting it. But they were no more indulgent
than they were alert. Three of them-Bellarmine, Sfrondati, and Ferdinando
Taverna-had participated in the proceedings that had condemned Bruno.
Their intention or oversight was compounded by the presence of the pope
at their decisive meetings. Since popes might have the power to declare here­
sies, Paul's involvement and approval have supported the opinion that in 1616
the Roman Catholic Church declared Copernican cosmology a heresy."
This does not appear to be the way in which either the Master of the
Sacred Palace or the Congregation of the Index interpreted the situation. Nei­
ther referred to heresy in describing the offense of Copernican writings. One
member of the Congregation, Maffeo Barberini, may have opposed impos­
ing any sanctions at all. "That was never our intention," he said later in his
papal we, "and if it had been up to us, that decree [of the Index] would not
have been made." Barberini looked at the Copernican system from a point of
view that made it ineligible to be a heresy." He owed this insight or its confir­
mation to "his faithful Bellarmine," his theological advisor Agostino Oreggi.
Like Bellarmine, Oreggi believed that when the bible spoke about the natural
world its word was law. Where it did not, as in the disposition of the light that
shone before the creation of the sun, we are free to speculate, but no more.
God did not consult man about creation. "Where wast thou [lob] when I laid
the foundation of the earth? declare if thou hast understanding, who hath
laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest. Whereupon are the foundations

222
GALILEO
thereof fastenedr''" Oreggi-Barberini understood that we cannot decipher
God's plan any more than Job could. In His omnipotence, He could make
and remake the world in a thousand ways we cannot even imagine. We can
never know for certain how he did or does it.
Barberini, who was a lawyer but no theologian, adopted this excessive vol­
untarism (so called for stressing God's will, voluntas) as a sort oflegal restraint
on philosophizing. The doctrine was not fresh, as it goes back at least to
the time of Adam, who had it from the Angel Raphael. Shut up the book of
nature, Raphael had advised Adam, after you have reckoned the months and
years and seasons, for God will not reward further researches.
From man or angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by those who ought
Rather admire: or if they list to try
Conjecture, he his fabric of the heav'ns
Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide."
Conjectures that provoke divine chortles do not make heresies. Barberini's
voluntarism did not allow Copernicanism to be true or false. Both Galileo
and the consultors to the Holy Office erred in taking it to be more than a
mere hypothesis.
Barberini knew that Galileo held dangerous views on this subject. In On
Floating Bodies, he would have found that Galileo sought the "true, intrinsic,
and entire cause" of natural phenomena." Ifhe had also read his friend's Let­
ters on sunspots, he would have learned that not even Omnipotence could have
made the spots appear as they do by a mechanism different from Galilee's,
all others being "manifest impossibilities and contradictions.t'" In Christian
charity, Barberini undertook to inform Galileo about the hypothetical char­
acter of all claims to natural knowledge. Their conversation, dating, prob­
ably, from 1615 or 1616, and reported over a decade later by Oreggi, went
something like this:
Bar. Even if the Copernican theory fit all relevant phenomena per­
fectly, would you deny that God might have constructed the
universe on principles entirely different from those Coperni­
cus adopted? I do not mean whether another universe might

MISCALCULATED RISKS
223
be possible, but whether, all appearances remaining the same,
ours might be produced by many different means. Rephrased
in Aristotelian terms, can the "accidents" of bodies-their
colors, shapes, motions-remain the same if their essences
change?"
Gal. It is not my business to inquire into all the ways that God
might have done something, but the way that, in His wisdom,
he chose to do it.
Barb. How do you know that in His wisdom he does not now and
again transubstantiate earth from platform to planet, and the
world from Tychonic to Copernican, or vice versa, without
our knowing it; or annihilate the whole works while continu­
ing their appearances; or expand or contract the universe and
everything in it by the same proportion, without changing
anything as perceived by our senses?"
"Having heard all this [so Oreggi concluded his anecdote] the very learned
mathematician fell silent. For which he earned praise for [his] intelligence and
his behavior."?' Silence is not acquiescence, however, but "the best composi­
tion and temperature [so advises Francis Bacon] ... if there be no remedy."?
Galileo could not concede that the grail he sought lay beyond the reach of
humankind.
From later events it appears that Barberini did not know of the special
warning given Galileo by Bellarmine. The probable reason for the unusual
admonition, which would not have been necessary if everyone understood
that belief in a stationary sun was a heresy, was that Galileo had tried to
set up a critical philosophico-theology in place of the uncritical interdis­
ciplinary Thomism he thought he had destroyed. If that is a correct read­
ing, Galileo did well to escape relatively unscathed from the predicament in
which he had put himself. As he said, he was not mentioned by name. Had
he published his Letter to Christina, it would have been condemned along with
Foscarini's Copernican apology. Galileo's devoted enemies in Florence, espe­
cially Archbishop Marzi Medici, thought that he had got by too lightly, and
commissioned new fire-breathers to preach against him." To be sure, the
admonition against teaching Copernicus, if taken literally, would have been
a bitter pill. Galileo sought ways to avoid swallowing it while Bellarmine and
Paul prepared for a better life. They both entered it in 1621.

224 GALILEO
6.2 POETICAL INTERLUDE
Guicciardini was delighted to see his troublesome guest leave for Florence.
Galileo would not listen to him or to Cardinal del Monte or other friends, but
remained belligerent. "He [was] in a mood to castrate the friars." Guicciardini
had to live another two months with his firebrand before he could persuade
Cosimo to order Galileo home. No good could come of his belligerence, Guic­
ciardini predicted, correctly; "he can only lose if he fights the fratri."94 There
was a second reason that the ambassador wanted to rid himself of the father
of modern science. Galileo and Superintendent Primi sponsored "strange
and scandalous doings" when they got together, "a riotous life" for which the
ambassador had to pay." No doubt the bibulous evenings included the liter­
ary types among whom Galileo found many of his patrons and supporters.
Literary lynxes
In 1620 the literary world had the thrill of reading the Poemata of Maffeo
Barberini, published in Paris by the French polymath litterateur Nicolas
Claude Fabri de Peiresc. The poems Peiresc printed included verses on Mary
Magdalene, Saint Louis IX, and Galileo. The lines regarding the last of this
odd trio appear as illustrations in a poem on the variety of human life and
its deceptions." People go off in many different directions, the cardinal sang,
looking here and there,
Some at the Scorpion's heart, or into the Dog's face,
Others stare rather at Jupiter's Clan,
And his father Saturn's, discovered,
Learned Galileo, with your glass.
Yet, things are seldom what they seem:
Not always does a thing that blazes
Externally also shine within: in the sun we see
Black spots (who would believe it?) uncovered
By your art, 0 Galileo.97
Placing the spots within the sun was to go a step beyond Galileo.

225
Barberini sent Galileo a copy of his Poemata with a warm inscription
warmly reciprocated. The two Florentines could acknowledge and appreci­
ate one another's merits as their unfettered ambitions had not yet brought
them into competition. Like Galilee's literary criticism, Barberini's poems
were products of leisure hours." And like Galileo's poems, Barberini's do
not please modern taste. "Barberini's Poemata ... , [are] desolately empty of
any poetic inspiration. They are a string of commonplaces of insupportable
banality.'?" Good or bad-and many discriminating contemporaries discov­
ered nuggets among them-they were praised mercilessly after Barberini
became pope. As obscure early works of winners of the Nobel Prize for
Literature shoot up in value retrospectively, so Barberini's poems rose into
reprints immediately upon his elevation and saw a dozen or more revised
and enlarged editions during his lifetime, some set to music. The resultant
accolades-"a new David ... a new Apollo"-helped puff up a vanity already
greater than Calileo's.'?"
Among Barberini's discriminating contemporary admirers were several
lynxes. Although not of Cesi's band, the future pope was close enough
to them to be regarded, with a little poetic license, as a patron and fellow
traveler. Around 1618 he developed an important connection with two
young literary lynxes, Strozzi's protégé Ciampoli and Cesi's cousin Vir­
ginio Cesarini, both of them then on the threshold of spectacular careers
at the Vatican and devoted service to Galileo (Plates 7 and 11).101 After
a year spent in Padua at Calileo's suggestion, Ciampoli had freed him­
self from the libertas patavina to spend time with Barberini, then, in 1611,
legate in Bologna, and with the bibliophile Cardinal Federico Borromeo,
still Archbishop of Milan. They represented different but complementary
approaches to Catholic renewal, Borromeo the old-testamentary and dis­
ciplinary, and Barberini the uplifting and poetical.':" This, anyway, was
the conceit invented by Ciampoli, who presaged a glorious future for the
church under Moses' staff wielded by Great Federico and David's lyre
strummed by Great Maffeo. This future Ciampoli opened to Borromeo
(whose chances of becoming pope he evidently estimated as higher than
Barberini's) in a Poemetto sacro dispatched in 1616. "To live a king, 'tis but
one way I For to this truth the soul doth swear I 'A kingdom's thrall,
beauty decays I Virtue alone dominates fate' ."103
While Ciampoli sought to follow both Moses of Milan and David of Bolo­
gna, Galileo recommended him to the Lynx of Rome. Ciampoli quickly

226
GALILEO
jumped into an orbit around Cesi, in whose cousin Cesarini he found some­
one to whom he could devote himself entirely. Cesarini, five years Ciam­
poli's junior, had everything this world has to offer but good health. The
son of a duke, closely related to the Orsini and the Farnese, rich, brilliant,
sensitive, he had improved his natural gifts through study with the Jesuits.
At the Roman College he impressed not only Barberini but also Bellarmine
as a prodigy in erudition. The great controversialist saw in the young man
"another Pico"-at the age of 23 the first Pico (Pico della Mirandola) had pro­
posed to defend 900 theses on all subjects against all comers-and tried to
enlist him in the pious work of destroying the teachings of that pest from
Padua Cremonini. When he met Ciampoli, Cesarini was deeply committed
to Aristotelian philosophy as mediated by the Jesuits and to a moralizing
poetics in the tone of Ciampoli's Pocmetto.'?'
Although Cesarini had been intrigued by the Starry message when his
teachers at the Jesuit college in Parma had enthused over it, he did not take an
interest in astronomy until Galileo came to Rome. The brilliant disputations
for Copernicus and against all opponents that Galileo conducted there had
the same effect on Cesarini as the mathematical lessons Galileo gave Cosimo
had had on Ciampoli, and with the same result. The learned youth under­
went a sort of baptism (washing out his mind, he said, as mineral waters
purged his body) and opened the pages of Euclid. Soon, despite a lingering
adherence to Jesuit philosophy, he became lynx material, or so the Roman
lincei, including Galileo, decided at a meeting in the spring of 1616. In 1618
Cesarini and Ciampoli, who shared the homoerotic orientation of the found­
ing lineei, were admitted together. Cesarini quickly reached the academic van
as vicar of the Roman lincei during Cesi's protracted residence at his family
seat in Acquasparta between 1618 and 1621.105
Ciampoli and Cesarini enrolled in Calileo's campaign against received
philosophy at first in so far as they saw themselves engaged in a similar
fight against authority in poetry. Although Galileo liked their fighting spirit,
he could not have approved their targets, which included the classic Ital­
ian poetry he loved. They wished to write in Pindaric odes, at once pious
and lyrical, moralizing and inventive. In this they claimed Barberini as their
cicerone, "the great Maffeo, who joined together the strings of David with
the Argive harp."'?" In March 1619 Cesarini sent Barberini a recipe for an
extract of cedar, which, when mixed with a little limoncello, was very useful
to poets. "It is a most potent diuretic." Perhaps it was responsible for the

MISCALCULATED RISKS
227
effusion with which Cesarini acknowledged one of Barberini's inspiring
productions, worthy, he wrote, of the happy times before Cesar. "Although
I'm sick in bed, I do not want or dream of any other brook to slake my thirst
than the inexhaustible fountain of your genius."!" Ciampoli and Cesarini's
heroic-moralistic poetry in turn inspired Barberini.'?" Their output has won
only a modest place in literature. A standard authority dismisses Ciampoli's
work as conventional blather about sacred, moral, and funereal subjects,
or about the vacuity of the human condition, "not deserving the name of
poetry." Cesarini's moralistic productions receive higher marks owing to
their occasional expressions of honest melancholy inspired by his debili­
tating illness. The moral verses of their appointed leader Barberini rank as
more skillful than heartfelt, "dignified but not lyrical.'"?"
Though writing uplifting verses in a Grecian style for his friends and
patrons remained Ciarnpoli's ambition, he needed greater security than
poetry and Strozzi's continuing subvention could bring. His active net­
working brought him into the entourage of Alessandro Ludovisi, who suc­
ceeded Paul V in 1621. The new Pope, Gregory XV, was the first incumbent
of St. Peter's chair trained by the Jesuits. Among his accomplishments
during his short time in office were the canonization of the Jesuit saints
Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier, the establishment of the Congrega­
tion for the Propagation of the Faith, and the appointment of Giovanni
Ciampoli of the fluent pen as his Secretary for Latin correspondence.
Ciampoli introduced Cesarini into the pope's household as a gentleman
in waiting."?
Meanwhile the Roman lynxes had commissioned a piece of literature that
made Cesarini famous. Together with Cesi, they pushed Galileo to answer a
counterattack on him by a Jesuit he had provoked under circumstances soon
to be related. The three lynxes decided that the answer, entitled the Assayer
(Saggiatore), would appear in the form of a letter to Cesarini; and Galileo wrote
him into the work as if he were collaborating in judging the Jesuit, who, to
add to the fun, was a distinguished member of the college that had praised
Cesarini as a new Pico. Without the editorial help and frequent goading of
the Roman lynxes, Galileo might not have written the Saggiatore, in which he
embedded, among much unfair criticism, some beautiful expressions of his
method of philosophizing. I I I
The production of the Assayer and subsequent interactions among Ciam­
poli, Barberini, and Galileo, illustrate with particular clarity the importance,

228
GALILEO
indeed, the necessity for innovative natural science to link itself to literature
in Italy during the early modern period. As shown by Ciampoli's career,
ability to write poetry gave entrée to academies and powerful patrons, and
might end with a position of influence and a command of patronage within
and outside the omnipresent church. As we know, Galileo first made contact
with patrons like Strozzi through Florentine literary acadernies.!" And, as
we also know, among the first to extol his discoveries were poets. This mode
of promotion did not cease with the decree of 1616. A poet could sing things
a philosopher could not say. Two examples must suffice.
The first comes from the Adone of the bold and verbose Neapolitan Giam­
battista Marino, at home equally in courts and prisons, who stuffed his
poems with sensual images, clattering metaphors, and the stories, mytholo­
gies, tropes, clichés, and paradoxes of all the humanist poets from Petrarch
to Tasso. The sensuality and subject matter, which made Marino anathema
to Barberini's circle, might have recommended him to Galileo except that
Marino liked the sort of word play (32 consecutive oxymorons in one case),
foreplay (Venus' endless chase of Adonis), and neologisms that Galileo had
lambasted in his comments on Tasso.'!'
Marino's Adonis takes the opportunity to examine the dark regions of the
moon while rising in Dante's manner toward the stars. He considers several
explanations of the mottling, including delle Colombe's polished crystal with
mountain's inside, before his better informed traveling companion tells him
that if his sight were stronger he would see seas and rivers, cities, hills, and
plains. That will come to pass. "You'll be able to shorten the longest spaces I
with a little tube and two crystalline lenses."!" The engineer of this miracle is
a new and better Columbus:
Exposing the bosom of the deep sea
Not without violence and anger
The Ligurian Argonaut discovered in this lower world
A new clime and a new land.
You [Galileo], second Typhus not of sea but of heaven,
Spying out what turns and what holds
Without any risk, for all peoples everywhere,
Will discover new truths and new things.'!'
The risk-free environment for new truths may exist only in the poetical
imagination.

The future tense ("Galileo will discover") belongs to a gimmick, often
employed by Ariosto and Tasso, whereby a past seer predicts the completed
future. It allowed the Venetian poet Giulio Strozzi, who had seen Galileo in
action in Rome in 1611, to move from discovery of the Medici stars to rev­
elation of the Copernican system. Strozzi's seer is the wizard Merlin, who
invented the telescope and discovered Jupiter's moons, Apollo's spots, and
Saturn's companions. With these clues, Merlin worked out that the planets
revolve around the sun. Being wise as well as clever, he kept his discoveries
from people too ignorant to appreciate them. That was everyone. Eventually,
he prophesied, the time would be ripe for rediscovery and revelation. "The
time will come ... when the finest mind of Tuscany will renew my famous
glasses."!" The arts and sciences would then flourish with a race of Merlins
inspired by Galileo.
Literary lion
Poetry is a medicine on its own as well as a sugar coat for unpleasant truths.
"Therefore [Sagredo instructed Galileo] continue to read Berni and Ruzza­
nte, and set aside Aristotle and Archimedes for a while." Galileo never lacked
poems to read. Poets good and bad submitted their work for his judgment.
Not infrequently he himself was their subject, "Galileo, who first opened the
closed gate beyond the earth."!" Buonarroti and several promising younger
poets met in an informal poetical seminar in Galileo's house in Florence.I"
Occasionally he attended meetings of the Accademia Fiorentina, of which
he was elected consul in January of 1620.1l9 Rhetoric rather than geometry
would be the weapon of his missionary struggle.
Before 1616, the books that Galileo published under his own name were
reports of new phenomena (Sidereus nuncius, Letter on sunspots) or develop­
ments of old theory (On floating bodies). Although the Italian works some­
times stooped to sarcasm and insult, their purpose was not to offend but
to present discoveries and persuade readers of their reliability and of Gali­
leo's right to claim them. The three books Galileo wrote between 1616 and
1632 deliver little new in science, but many innovations in the art of persua­
sion. The first of these books, Discorso delle cornete (Discourse on comets), was
published in 1619. Tellingly, a literary man, Mario Guiducci, unveiled it, in a
lecture to the Accademia Fiorentina. It has two off-stage participants, Galileo
and Orazio Grassi, the Jesuit mathematician under attack. The second, the

230
GALILEO
Assayer (1623), again has two off-stage personae, "Lothario Sarsi," the pseu­
donym under which Grassi replied to "Guiducci," and Cesarini, to whom
Galileo turns frequently for a laugh at "Sarsi." The third book, Galileo's rhe­
torical masterpiece or, to use Campanella's words, "philosophical comedy,"
the Dialogue on the two chief world systems (1632), brings the three interlocutors
of the Assayer on stage, with "Salviati" as Guiducci, "Sagredo" as Cesarini, and
"Simplicio" as Sarsi.!" Galileo remains in the wings, to manipulate the actors
in their oppositions and digressions (comedies within a comedy, as Salviati
put it) and to receive their praises.
We have a commedia dell'arte, a series of duels among masked men. Sarsi
(Grassi) attacks Guiducci (Galileo); Galileo as assayer defends Guiducci, that
is, himself, against Sarsi; Salviati sometimes wears the mask of Copernicus
(he says so himself) while also masquerading as Galileo; Sagredo, while
pretending to be a neutral commentator, is another avatar of Galileo. Only
Simplicio is what he appears to be, a gentle idiot, stuffed with the learning
of the schools, unable to think for himself, as immovable as the Aristotelian
earth, in short, a comic caricature of all the philosophers who had had the
effrontery to dismiss the revelations of Galileo. Participants in a masquerade
can speak and act more extravagantly than they do in ordinary life. Galileo
took full advantage of the license, asserting, via Guiducci or Salviati, many
doubtful and outlandish things, and not a few white lies. His many exag­
gerations of the instances and accuracy of his measurements fit well here. In
his philosophical comedy, bodies of different sorts all fell at the same speed,
"within a hair's breadth," in hundreds and even thousands of trials; pendu­
lums of different amplitudes swung in unison, "within a heart's beat," after
hundreds or even thousands of oscillations; an inked ball described a perfect
parabola when rolled on a sloped plane; and so on.!"
And what shall we make of the extravagance of the Pisan Drop, the crea­
tion point of the planets, said to answer perfectly to calculations? Or of the
bizzarria (oddity), to which we will return, that a freely falling body does not
accelerate but only changes its direction of motion? Salviati takes the trou­
ble to demonstrate this bizzarria and Sagredo accepts it as a marvel. Modern
readers also wonder at it. Was Galileo, the master of experiment, the facile
geometer, the slayer of Aristotle, dishonest, as Arthur Koestler would have
him, or just a charlatan, as Paul Feyerabend preferred? Neither. Galileo as
stage manager is the creator of ingenious fancies, mathematical caprices, an
epic poem, a set of stories. Sagredo asks Salviati to describe the curve of a

sensical bizzarria; nature too is part of the masquerade.v? Galilee's comedic

satire. and gross caricature of the Assayer.123 As if to signal its epistemologi­
cal level. Galileo inserted into it more quotations from Ariosto than he did
in any other of his books.!"
The poetical lynxes grew more important for Galileo as some of the more
scientific ones distanced themselves from him after 1616. Johann Schreck,
astronomer and botanist, to Johann Faber, head of lincean botany: ''I'm
amazed that Galileo is pushing the motion of the earth so hard, as if it were
not enough to say that it is an hypothesis useful in astronomy, whatever its
truth. To my great inconvenience the edict will prevent me from using it to
calculate eclipses for the Chinese."!" A one-time lynx, Schreck had to resign
his membership when he joined the Jesuits and their mission to China. Luca
Valerio also resigned. As an employee of the Vatican compromised by his
intercession with his cardinal patron on Galileo's behalf and behest, Valerio
thought it best to cancel his connection with a group identified with his old
friend. Like Kepler, Valerio blamed Galileo for bringing on the condemna­
tion of 1616.126
That left more room for poets.
6.3 ILL OMENS
The edict of 1616 hit the Jesuits as well as the Galileists. The enthusiasm of
their mathematicians for telescopic astronomy ran against the tendency of
their general, Claudio Acquaviva, to see the fight over novelties in the heav­
ens as a second front in the struggle against heretics. It is truly written that
generals always fight the last war. In 1611 Acquaviva had demanded that his
troops, particularly those in the combat zone of the classroom, stick to Aris­
totelian philosophy as corrected by St Thomas. Disappointed over the lax
observation of this command by the rapidly increasing and diversifying body
of Jesuits, which grew from 5,000 to 13,000 during his reign, he renewed it
in December 1613 in even stronger terms: "whoever teaches views contrary
to St Thomas or who introduces new things into philosophy on his own ini­
tiative or from obscure authors is ordered to retract them immediately." As
appears from the case of Grienberger, this order made it very difficult for the

232
GALILEO
Jesuits of the Roman College to support Galilee's views on floating bodies,
let alone his Copernican religion.'> The decree of the Congregation of the
Index further restricted the adventures of Jesuit astronomers by discourag­
ing positive allusions to the Copernican theory or its defenders. Informed
professors who felt a responsibility to their subject found themselves in a
painful conflict. Between 1616 and 1620, when they issued their first Sphaera
after Clavius' last, the Society's mathematicians sought ways to remain true
both to their general and their pedagogy.128
Giuseppe Biancani, the author of the new Sphaera mundi (1620), tied his
book to Clavi us' farewell injunction: "in view of what Galileo diligently and
accurately set forth in the Nuncius sidereus, astronomers should see how the
celestial orbs are to be constituted so that these phenomena can be accounted
for." Biancani's solution, worked out partly in correspondence with Grien­
berger, was to adopt Tycho's system and justify it and other statements about
the constitution of the world by appeal to "the best astronomers" or "the
common opinion of astronomers." The closer to physics, the more diffident
the statements. Are the stars carried by a rigid firmament, like rivets in steel?
Probably. Do the planets move through the heavens like fish in the sea or
birds in the air? "Incompertum mihi est, I do not knoW."129 Under this cover, Bian­
cani delivered a very good textbook, filled with information indifferent to the
choice of world systems (calendars, eclipses) and descriptions of the new phe­
nomena-the mountainous moon, spotted sun, horned Venus, companions
of Jupiter, bumps of Saturn. The sun sits in the middle of the other planets,
except for the moon, as if their Lord, "according to the common opinion of
astronomers." Copernicus, Tycho, and Kepler all teach that the planets circle
the sun as the moon does the earth.130 The statement was strictly true and pat­
ently false, a perfect, even a Jesuitical equivocation, since the earth is a planet
to Copernicus and a unique something else to Tycho.
Biancani ended his celestial survey with comets. Again he follows Tycho
in placing them in solar orbit above the moon. The arrangement agreed
with observations by Jesuit astronomers in many parts of Germany and
Italy of the brilliant comet first seen in late November 1618. Analysis carried
out at the Roman College showed that it sailed along a great circle in the
sky, around though not centered on the sun, at a distance to be determined.
There was this difficulty, however, that if circumsolar in the manner depicted
by Tycho (Figure 6.1), comets should show phases like Venus. Why do they
not? Furthermore, the traditional cosmology had no place for them, their

sudden appearances, slow declines, bizarre shapes, and free motion beyond
the moon. Could cosmology be patched to suit? "You see, dear reader, there
are many important questions to answer."!"
Baleful comet
The great comet of 1618 had given Grienberger and his colleagues the oppor­
tunity to engage the entire Roman College in the problems presented by the
new astronomy. During the Christmas vacation of 1618/19, they arranged
for four lectures on the comet, one each by a theologian, a mathemati­
cian, a philosopher, and a rhetorician. The philosopher tried to relate the
phenomena to Aristotelian principles, but showed some flexibility toward
them, which, to be fair, Aristotle did as well, since the best that he could

234
GAll LEO
say about his account of comets was that it was not impossible. The theolo­
gian also showed openness toward Galileo and his ideas.t ? The mathemati­
cian, Orazio Grassi, deduced the whereabouts of the comet from parallax
measurements and did not scruple to place it beyond the moon. A student
of Maelcote and Grienberger, Grassi was far different in real life from the fat
pig, rash idiot, and utter fool Galileo made him out to be in the Assayer.l33
By 1618, when he was 35, the utter fool had succeeded Maelcote and received
a charge from Acquaviva to set up a school of architecture. Grassi's fencing
with Galileo took place in odd corners of a religious life devoted to turn­
ing out mathematicians and churches for the glory of God. This is not idle
rhetoric. We have from Grassi an extended metaphor linking the Virgin Mary
and the Stella Maris, on the one hand, to salvation and mathematicians (as
navigators) on the other. Galileo's mathematics reached only to the heavens,
Grassi's to the Heaven that counts. In 1622, as Galileo put the finishing touches
on the Assayer, Grassi staged an operatic ascent to paradise.!" The occasion
was the canonization of Saints Loyola and Xavier. In Grassi's libretto, car­
loads of actors representing the various Jesuit provinces from Italy to China
brought gifts to the celebrants while a chorus of angels sang and danced in
clouds. The spectacle, set in ancient Rome, demanded the building and burn­
ing on stage of a large pyre in accordance with the rite that made gods of dead
emperors. Grassi designed all the machinery. The princes and prelates liked
what they saw and spread the fool's fame. One of the audience, the cardinal
nephew Ludovico Ludovisi, who had labored with his papal uncle to achieve
the canonization of Loyola and Xavier, was impressed enough to insure that
Grassi would have the place of principal architect of the church he commis­
sioned at the Collegio Romano. By no coincidence, the façade of Grassi's San
Ignazio, perhaps the greatest church built in Rome during the seventeenth
century, resembles his sketch for the stage set for the operatic apotheosis of
the Jesuit saints. Both of these curiously associated works can still be enjoyed,
San Ignazio in Rome and the opera on a CD issued in 2003.135
The lecture on the comet that Grassi published early in 1619 was even­
tempered, competent, useful, and, perhaps, a little brave, as it asserted
against Aristotle, straightforwardly and nonhypothetically, that comets are
celestial objects. In the playful, strained rhetoric admired by the Society,
Grassi remarked that the comet of 1618 was the first news from the sky since
the celestial messenger's, without, however, mentioning the messenger's
name.!> Instead, he gestured toward Tycho by suggesting that the comet

MISCALCULATED RISKS
235
might occupy an orbit between the moon and sun. To support these con­
clusions he observed that if it were the sort of burning sublunar exhalation
specified by Aristotle, it would have to consume fuel in incredible quantities
to maintain the size indicated by its vanishing parallax. Furthermore, like
the fixed stars it showed little or no magnification through the telescope, an
effect, Grassi said, of distance. He thought this argument important and con­
troversial enough to add that people who did not accept it had given insuf­
ficient attention to optical principles. Again, no mention of Galileo, who,
however, centering everyone's orbit on himself, would read the remark as
an insinuation that he did not know how his telescope worked."? Otherwise
Grassi's undogmatic lecture had nothing in it to arouse Galileo's ireYs
Galileo was not in a good mood when he received a copy. He had been
sick all winter, as he had been the winter before; a trip to and an ex-voto
left at the ex-home of the Virgin at Loreto during the intervening summer
did not return him to health.!" Also, he had then recently received a set­
back in his cherished project of making the Medici stars the pilots of the
seas. He had realized as he perfected their schedule of eclipses that he might
have in it a solution to the problem of finding longitude on shipboard. The
solution required knowledge of the time at some fixed location. The Jovian
system could serve as the clock. Observing the positions of the moons at
local time t1 and finding from the table the time t2 of the same configuration
as calculated for Florence, the navigator immediately had his longitude L in
degrees from the meridian through Florence as L = 15 (t2 - t1), the times being
measured in hours. Thus the theory. In practice the tables had to be accurate
to say 2 minutes of time (giving an error of half a degree at sea) and, what
was much more difficult, the observer had to be able to measure to the same
accuracy through a Galilean telescope from the deck of a pitching ship.
While in Rome in 1616, Galileo had discussed his invention with Spanish
officials and offered to go to Spain to show it to King Philip III. The terms were
stiff: 3000 scudi for the trip and necessary instruments, a royalty of 4,000
scudi per year for himself and 2000 per year to his heirs after his death, and
appointment to the royal order of San Iago. In return, Galileo would update
the tables every year and provide a method to steady the gaze of the naviga­
tor. This was headgear (celatone) with a single telescopic sight, leaving one eye
free to find Jupiter and the other fortified to track the moons. Castelli tested
the apparatus at sea, a labor of love as he suffered from seasickness. During
1617 Spanish interest cooled and Galileo preserved his record of never ven-

GALILEO
turing out of Northern Italy."? A pity. A stint in Spain might have kept him
out of serious trouble.
When Grassi's lecture arrived, Galileo was desultorily sorting his papers
on motion with the help of Guiducci, who was looking for a topic for lectures
he was to deliver as consul of the Accademia Fiorentina. People were asking
for an opinion about the comet, some of whom, like Archduke Leopold V
of Austria-Tyrol, could not be put off. Eureka! The archduke could have his
answer, Guiducci his subject, and Galileo an outlet for his black bile if he
wrote a lecture on comets for delivery and publication by Guiducci.!" As
Viviani almost said, this ill-advised Discourse on comets "gave rise to all the
controversies and injustice that Galileo suffered from then on." The judg­
ment was correct, the application wrong. Viviani ascribed the offense to
Grassi's rejoinder, not, as was the case, to Calileo's provocation.l?
"Guiducci" opened the campaign by repairing Grassi's omission of the
name of that "noble and sublime intellect who adorns the present age." This
anonymous ornament had to suffer persecution, and also robbery, by inflated
ignoramuses, who puffed themselves up with ideas they did not understand,
"pretending to be Apelleses, when with poorly colored and worse designed
pictures they have aspired to be artists, though they could not compare in
skill with even the most mediocre painters." Like his fellow Jesuit Scheiner,
Grassi was a false Apelles. His performance was "suspicious," his reason­
ing weak, his optics "idle." The mathematicians of the Roman College who
approved his lecture could be no better than he. "Let those others be assured
that we shall justly pass upon them the judgment which they have wrongly
made against US."143 What judgment? The extravagance of the accusation
suggests that Galileo's main motive in going after Grassi was to repay Jesuit
mathematicians for deserting him in 1615.
Galileo-Guiducci proceed to judgment. Aristotle suffers as usual for his
errors about comets, fire, exhalations, meteors, orbs, and orbits, though
they do not figure in Grassi's lecture. Tycho, the great Tycho, who first
persuasively applied parallax measurements to comets, is an idiot, "inex­
cusably" negligent, "astonishingly wrong," "[lacking] even ordinary intelli­
gence." Grassi is a swindler as well as an idiot. He deduced the place of the
comet by parallax and its orbit by projection, and confirmed the finding by
physical arguments; but we must reject them all, root and branch, because
he did not establish that "all other possibilities [ are] vain and fallacious."!"
This was to erect against Grassi the same impossible standard of proof

MISCALCULATED RISKS
237
that Barberini had urged on Galileo and Bellarmine had employed against
Copernicanism.
Galileo-Guiducci suggested a model that certainly would not pass the
Barberini-Bellarmine test. It portrayed the comet as an exhalation from the
earth that mounts in a straight line toward the zenith of its source, moving at
a constant speed, and, when high enough, shining in the night sky by reflect­
ing solar rays. This new application of Galilee's old wrong theory of the nova
of 1604 had the advantages of raising doubts about standard theories and
of capturing comets in the forceless physics with which he was comfort­
able. The comet's irregular motion became merely apparent and its observed
distancing from the sun simply geometric (Figure 6.2). Since on this theory
some of the trajectory must lie beneath the moon, why do they never show
parallax? Well, if comets moved with the observer, like rainbows and moon
rings, they would be no fitter for parallax observations than Grassi. He knows

nothing of optics! He thinks that bodies enlarge the less the greater their dis­
tance from the observer. How can that be, Galileo-Guiducci ask, referring,
tellingly, to terrestrial observations at distances effectively "infinite" (with the
telescope adjusted to viewing the moon). They add, captiously, that a tel­
escope lengthened for closer viewing (and so giving greater magnification)
is not the same instrument as the same telescope shortened for astronomi­
cal use, and, erroneously, that without magnification stars invisible to the
naked eye cannot become visible through the telescope.':" A better answer,
given by Grassi, is that the objective lens gathers more light than the unaided
pupil does and so can make an otherwise invisible star perceptible. Galileo's
instrument could not magnify stars.
Lecturing by proxy to a literary academy gave Galileo a platform from
which to insinuate Copernican ideas and destroy competitors without
asserting anything himself or endangering his mouthpiece. He has Guiducci
teach that comets form a material bond between the terrestrial and celestial
region; that all true planetary motions must be in the same direction (true
for Tycho and Copernicus but not for Ptolemy); that Venus encircles the sun;
and that spin and revolution (motions that do not alter relations among a
body's parts) are tantamount to rest. And, with inspired dissimulation, Gui­
ducci admitted that his otherwise very plausible, almost certain theory of
comets could not be brought into agreement with observation without an
additional cause he feigned not to knoW.146 Grassi would understand the
admission as a veiled hint at the earth's motion.
The intensity of Galileo-Cuiducci's rebuttal of Grassi's assertion that
the telescope does not magnify stars suggests that something more than
optics and amour propre was at stake. Here is a possible explanation. A prin­
cipal argument against the Copernican system, which Tycho had regarded
as conclusive, derived from its implications about the size of stars. Tycho's
instruments could detect angular distances of around one arc-minute but
could not find any annual parallax in the fixed stars. On Copernicus' theory,
the maximum parallax X of a star a distance s from the sun is = dis, where
d is the diameter of the earth's orbit. The apparent size a of a star at this
distance is cid, where c is the star's diameter. Pretelescopic astronomers sup­
posed that a for a star of the second or third magnitude was about 1 arc­
minute. Assume that one of these stars has the just undetectable parallax of
around 1/. Then X = a and c = d. If Copernicus was right, such a star rolled
onto the ecliptic plane would just fill the entire orbit of the earth. That was

MISCALCULATED RISKS
239
too monstrous to credit. Both Scheiner and Ingoli urged this objection as
fatal.147
Galileo had pointed out in Sidereus nuncius that stars shrink when viewed
through the telescope owing to loss of the irradiation or scintillation with
which the naked eye endows them. However, according to Galileo, the tel­
escope also magnifies them, stripping them perhaps to invisibility but then
restoring them to greater brilliance by enlarging their naked disks. (For the
planet Venus, Galileo deduced a true magnification after removal of scintil­
lations of about 2.5 through a 20-power telescope.) Thus although he knew
that the naked stellar disk had an angular width of well under a minute, he
accepted that it was perceptible and guessed that it amounted to 5" for a star
of the first magnitude and to 5" 16 for one of the sixth. In the latter case, a =
xln and c = terrestrial radii (t.r.) on the usual assumption that d = 2400 t.r.,
which did not seem incredible. In this way, Galileo thought that he could
answer Tycho's challenge to Copernicus and retain the idea of finite stellar
disks.':" Why did he not escape the problem altogether by agreeing with
Grassi that the stars had no perceptible size when viewed through the tel­
escope? It was not Galileo's style to accept corrections from others.
In his influential Astronomia pars optica (1604), Kepler had suggested that
comets move not in a Tychonic circle but in a straight line, the appar­
ent curvature in their paths being an effect of the earth's rotation.':"
Galileo-Guiducci had adopted this idea with some modifications, though,
of course, they could not say so; but, to a knowledgeable astronomer
like Grassi, the connection between the unspecified additional cause that
would bring their cometary theory into line with observation and Kepler's
model was obvious.l'" In 1619 Kepler reaffirmed and refined the model,
from which, as he put it, he could derive as many arguments for the annual
motion as there were comets in the sky. lSI That left Galileo-Guiducci badly
exposed.
"The Jesuits are much offended by [your discourse]." Thus Ciampoli
informed Galileo of the reaction he might have desired. That was in July
1619. In December the good fathers were heard to mutter "annihilate" when
Calileo's name came Up.152 The patient Grienberger was shocked at the harsh
treatment of Apelles, Grassi, and the mathematicians, nay, the mathematics,
of the Roman College. They had not attacked Galileo (nor, for that matter, did
Biancani in the Sphaera being printed when Guiducci addressed the Accademia
Fiorentina), but rather treated him well and openly. "I cannot imagine what

GALILEO
was in his mind that he could think himself attacked and prefer to suspect
than to excuse if perhaps something was asserted not entirely agreeable to
his opinions."153 Grassi too was flabbergasted: "I do not know what reason
he has for vilifying the good name of this Collegio Romano" and for writing
in so "exasperated and angry a spirit."!" But he understood perfectly that
Galileo opposed him because he followed Tycho. Galileo had no room for
Tycho's awkward compromise, quite apart from the question of cometary
orbits. Those who took refuge in the Tychonic asylum would reject Galileo's
staging of the war of the worlds as a fight between progressive modern sci­
ence and outmoded ancient ignorance. The Jesuits' adoption of the Tychonic
system, a false system invented by a false Christian, was a strategic blow to
Galileo. His reaction to Grassi's lecture on comets betrayed his realization
that the new respectability of Tycho's system made his mission-if he should
have a chance to resume it-much more difficult.l"
According to these considerations, Galileo's vehemence against Grassi's
innocuous lecture betrayed irritation at an imagined insult and fear that the
Jesuits might succeed in placing Tycho on the pedestal from which he, Galileo,
had just toppled.Ptolemy,'> Two further considerations will help to explain
the quixotic behavior that placed Galileo on the path to the windmill. One
is psychological. He answered so harshly (so he wrote in his copy of Grassi's
reply to Guiducci) for the same reason that he was so eager to renew the
fray: "for the truth."!" He could not defend the truth, the Copernican system,
openly. An unhorsed Quijote, he had to depend on a Sancho Panza like Gui­
dueci. He was sick, muzzled, frustrated, melancholic, irrational. Never one
to nuance character, Galileo put competent Jesuit astronomers in the same
box with the Horkys and delle Colombes. As Aristotle had observed, and
Cesi had echoed in a recent statement of the aims of his academy, "By nature
all men desire to know." Applying the observation to Jesuit mathematicians
and philosophers, Galileo inferred that they thwarted the higher as well as
the lower dictates of human nature. They sought knowledge and yet obeyed
the orders of ignorant superiors, as if they were dead weights forcibly pre­
vented from seeking the center of the earth. The true natural inquirer, freed,
as Cesi hoped he had made the lynxes, from artificial constraints to fulfilling
their natures, "swore in the words of no master."!"
The second consideration is that Calileo's behavior was not irrational but
carefully calculated. He responded not as a philosopher, world builder, or
frustrated prophet, but as a "competent courtier." To cut the Jesuits with

MISCALCULATED RISKS
241
their many scattered mathematicians down to his size, Galileo devised a
theory that eliminated one of their competitive advantages. If comets were
immune from parallax, Grassi would obtain no advantage from the Soci­
ety's far-flung observers. Throwing out aggressive challenges to individual
combat knocked Grassi off balance. He would fall for the ploy and try to
answer in kind, since he too was caught in a patronage network. But he had
no chance in literary combat, or exchange of insults, with Calileo.!" Galileo's
worry that he might lose prestige with his patrons could have augmented his
already robust concern for his reputation. The ingenious notion that he put
forward his cometary theory specifically to destroy the value of the Jesuits'
parallax observations, and not because he thought it probable, or because it
agreed with Copernican theory as construed by Kepler, may be more Machi­
avellian than Galileian.
There was one more round in the exchange between Grassi and Guiducci
before Galileo delivered the knock-down rhetorical blow in 1623. Grassi pro­
posed to weigh Guiducci-Galileo in An astronomical and philosophical balance.
To shield himself and the Jesuits from the inevitable return thrust, he pre­
tended to write as his student "Lotario Sarsi Sigensano." Guiducci-Galileo
easily discerned "Oratio Grassi Salonensi" in this transparent but imperfect
anagram; for Grassi was not from Salona but from Savona, and Salona is
precariously close, orthographically speaking, to Salone, an ancient place
famous for its pigs. Rhetorical play on "Grassi" and pigs was hard to resist;
but after a trial in draft Guiducci decided to spare Grassi the insult and reply
to Sarsi as if he existed."?
Sarsi made three weighings. The first set aside Guiducci as a front, a mere
Sarsi, as indeed he was. Galileo sent out Guiducci's book as if it were his
own, and Archduke Leopold and other recipients of it replied to Galileo as
its author.'?' The first weighing also assayed Galileo's manners and methods.
As to manners: "[you] much preferred to lose a friend than an argument."
Touché. Turning to methods, Sarsi neatly observed that the parallax argu­
ment, bringing mathematics against Aristotle, should have pleased Galileo;
that the telescope did not operate on the stars as Galileo thought it did;
and that his pose of ignorance about the missing "cause" of the apparent
motions of comets was a dissimulation. Then, hitting Galileo on the wound
inflicted by the Holy Office, Sarsi recalled that saving the phenomena in the
manner of Kepler, by means of a moving earth, is "in no way permitted to
us Catholics."162 The second weighing found Galilee's Aristotelian notion of

242
GALILEO
an exhalation, his assimilation of comets to rainbows, and his referral of the
twist in comet tails to refraction, wanting on optical grounds and physical
principles. Grassi's line of reasoning enabled him again to drop his balance
on the open wound. "If the earth is not moved, [Galileo's] straight motion
does not agree with the observations of the comet; but it is certain that
among Catholics the earth is not moved." This was not to accuse Galileo
of disobedience or unfaithfulness, but of something far worse: incoherence,
equivocation, and incompetence in logical argument.!"
The third weighing evaluated arguments against Aristotelian physics dis­
charged en passant by Galileo-Guiducci. "My whole desire here is nothing
less than to champion the conclusions of Aristotle"-and nothing more. "I
shall not delay over the question whether the remarks of that great man are
true or false." The main conclusion at issue derived from the assumption
that the concave surface of the sphere of the moon (not the moon itself,
but the hypothetical orb peripatetics had invented to bear it) could drag
around the fire and air immediately under it in its rotation. Neither Grassi
nor Galileo believed in the existence of the orb about which their masked
avatars disputed. For the sake of argument, however, they supposed that
its effect on fire could be simulated by that of a rotating body on a candle
flame or a suspended leaf placed near or in it. Would the flame or leaf
tremble? Galileo: no, or very feebly, if the body's surface is rough. Grassi:
yes, and a little roughness can be supposed in the non-existent orb since,
as Galileo had discovered, the moon itself is covered with prickles. Also,
Galileo's explanation of the sunspots as cloud-like material rotating with
the sun assumed just the sort of drag that Aristotle had supposed; and fur­
ther, if we were allowed to mention it, Galileo's concept of the non-existent
diurnal motion implies that the earth conveys its atmosphere with it. In
any case, Sarsi observed, the experiments required patience. The transfer
to enclosed air of motion from its rotating container would take much
longer than a similar transfer to water. Ciampoli witnessed these experi­
ments and reported their outcomes to Galileo.'>'
Aristotle taught that air friction could heat bodies to incandescence.
Galileo denied it. Grassi made the tactical error of adducing the evidence
of ancient poets and philosophers, and "other men also of great authority
and trustworthiness." From the Byzantine lexicographer Suidas he gathered
the quaint example that Babylonian soldiers used to cook eggs by whirling
them rapidly in a sling. Seneca had reported the melting of lead pellets shot

through the air. Aristotle himself attested to the heating of flying arrow
tips. A modern historian had described the disintegration of lead linings of
careering cannonballs. Sarsi: "Who believes that [such] men ... would wish
egregiously and impudently to lie?" Coming still closer to Aristotle's method
of kindling comets, Sarsi resourcefully invoked the eerie ignition of vapors
rising over cemeteries on hot days.':"
Finally, against Galileo's denial that bodies can be seen through flame,
and, consequently, that comets, whose tails do not occult stars, cannot be
burning matter, Father Grassi allowed himself a little fun. The man who
prided himself on his mastery of experiment, on his "facility in the expla­
nation of very difficult matters by very simple demonstrations," had over­
reached. "I have found each experiment entirely false-may Galileo spare me
for speaking the truth." Grassi pointed out that printed type close behind a
candle flame could be read through it and that the visibility of other objects
depended on their distance from the candle and the eye, on their nature,
and on other sources of illumination present.!" Perhaps to ignite Galileo,
Grassi illustrated the transparency of flame by a story from scripture. Bad
King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, having ordered his people to worship a
golden statue, did not take kindly to the report that the Jews Shadrach, Mesh­
ach, and Abednego, who held high office under him, had not bowed down
as instructed. Nebuchadnezzar commanded them to do so with the induce­
ment that, if they refused, he would throw them into a burning fiery furnace.
They refused. The infuriated king had the furnace heated seven times hotter
than ever before. It fried the executioners but not the doomed men. "Lo!''
said Nebuchadnezzar, "I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire,
and they have no hurt: and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."167
Guiducci did not try to answer Grassi's physical arguments. Instead he
wrote a letter of complaint to a prominent professor of rhetoric at the Roman
College, Tarquinio Galluzzi, who may well have been his teacher when he
was trained there "with incredible and paternal love." The letter's main inter­
est lies in Cuiducci's claim to authorship of the Discorso and in inflamma­
tory ad hominem arguments against Grassi (immodest, biting, cutting, at best
a copier of Galilean style) and Scheiner (plodding, inartistic, thieving, at best
a copier of Galilean discoveries). Guiducci compared himself to a Clavius,
who made a creative composition largely from the work of others, and to
an Andrea del Sarto, who did not disdain to copy a picture by Raphael.
By following Galileo, Guiducci exceeded Grassi by the same margin that

244
GALILEO
Michelangelo outperformed Apelles.w For the rest, Guiducci downgraded
Galilee's comet theory to a possibility introduced merely for discussion, dis­
posed of Grassi's experiments as "very fallacious and not free from suspicion
offraud," and neatly bettered Grassi in exegesis."? In a verse in Daniel omit­
ted by Grassi (and also not present in the King James version), an angel put
out the fire when Shadrach and his friends entered the furnace. Guiducci
genuflected ironically in the direction of Trent. "I do not mean to place my
interpretation upon this, and I defer the matter completely and entirely to
the declarations and expositions of holy doctors and professors of divinity;
let them judge ... [whether] King Nebuchadnezzar saw the holy ones amid
the flame ... and let them say also whether or not it is praiseworthy to cite
Holy Scripture in this manner."!" Checkmate.
Since Cuiducci's letter did not answer Sarsi's main optical and physical
arguments, and since the Jesuits advertised Grassi's Balance as a defeat for
Galileo, his friends, notably the lynxes Cesi, Cesarini, Ciampoli, and Stellutti,
urged him to respond. This represented a change in strategy. Cesi and Stel­
lutti had advised Galileo to avoid confrontation in general, and they regret­
ted that he had chosen to offend the Jesuits and close a door through which
his science might have entered the schools. Cesi had worked to keep the door
open by sending Bellarmine an erudite concordance of modern astronomy
and the utterances of the Fathers. Bellarmine had responded with praise and
the friendly advice that Cesi find something better to do. The best would be
to behave so as to end up in heaven, "where and when everything immedi­
ately will be clear. "171
While awaiting this enlightenment, Cesi pressed Galileo to answer Grassi's
Balance, quickly, lest the ignorant think the Roman College had defeated the
great lynx and destroyed the pretensions of the others. Ciampoli was the
most exigent, anticipating a devastating and novel riposte, "it being under­
stood everywhere that nothing comes from your hand but precious jewels
entirely unknown to others."!" The literary lynxes met to discuss the mode
of the reply-whether through Guiducci or another disciple, or in the form
of a letter to a third party. Although Galileo took his time (some two years
where Grassi had taken six weeks), he was not reluctant to pursue a course
that would bring defense of his amour propre into line with the desires of his
friends and patrons. He followed their advice in going after Sarsi rather than
the Roman College and in choosing Cesarini as correspondent; but he could
not bring himself to avoid the "pungency" that the lyncean editors could

not hope to remove. We are reminded again how provincial or peninsular
Galileo's purview was: his subject may have been the universe, but his audi­
ence was a few dozen highly-placed literate Italians whose good opinion he
prized.':"
Unfair balance
The Assayer is a heroic poem in prose, a "Sarsiad," a protracted tale of right
against wrong, good against evil, innocence against deceit. It is also a mock­
ing or mockery of a scholastic analysis of an Aristotelian text, divided into
53 snippets of the original each followed by an extensive commentary in
the lively style of the staged debates with which Galileo amused letterati in
Florence and Rome. Where Sarsi was content to peck around "like a blind
chicken" to find passages to weigh in his crude balance, Galileo would
behave as a "man ought to do" in assaying the work of others, leaving no
word unturned.!" "Now read this, your Lordship," Galileo says of each tidbit,
as if he were exhibiting an idiocy.v" Why bother with such stuff? Quoting
a line from Ariosto, Galileo intimated that he was condescending to argue
over truths he already possessed. Noblesse oblige. The line referred to a fight
between Orlando and Mandricardo over Orlando's sword. "Mine it is by
right, let us stage a chivalrous duel for it."176
The captatio benevolentiae-Galileo's opening intended to obtain the good
will of the reader-has nothing to do with chivalry or the matter in hand.
It is the old complaint, increasingly tinged with paranoia, that people had
either stolen his discoveries or, if too weak for plagiarism, deprecated and
dismissed thcm.!" This strident refrain follows awkwardly on three prefa­
tory hymns of praise to Galileo from two lynxes and, of all people, the book's
censor, the Dominican Niccolo Riccardi, who thus entered a story in which
he would playa major part. He had made his reputation in Spain, where he
cut so grand a figure as a preacher that the king himself, Philip III, came to
hear, and dubbed him "Father Monster," some say because of the size of his
belly and memory, others because of a head hard enough to crack walnuts.
In weighing the Assayer, the monster reckoned himself "fortunate to be born
when the gold of truth is no longer weighed in bulk and with the steelyard,
but is assayed with so delicate a balance." You may have had predecessors
and emulators, 0 Galileo (thus Johann Faber, hymnist, fellow lynx, and pon­
tifical pharmacist), "but you surpass the others by as great a distance as the

GALILEO
celestial stars are separated from the earth." The faithful and laborious Stel­
lutti added an appreciative ode in 24 verses, which concluded with the curi­
ously non-Copernican image, "You from whom [Heaven] much received I
shall, so long as it may turn I shine as bright as the stars that burn."!"
As an assayer Galileo seldom gives honest weight. He quibbles, bamboo­
zles, misleads, and misrepresents with such brilliance and invention as to
pass himself off as the injured party and, moreover, modest, unassuming,
and inevitably right.!" The incongruous opening, in which Galileo set­
tles scores with the thieves and belittlers among the imaginary legions of
his persecutors, is a good example of his even-handedness. After a generic
accusation he goes after Simon Mayr with lance and mace, fire and sword,
that Simon Mayr who, Galileo was convinced, had put up Capra to his infa­
mous plagiarism and, in his Mundus Jovialis (1614), had redoubled his offence
by claiming independence of Galileo in spying on the satellites of Jupiter.
The crime was the more foul because Kepler had preferred Mayr's values
of their periods to Galileo's. from which, to be sure, they differed but little,
and because-the thief's impudence knew no boundsl+-Mayr had corrected
Galileo's finding that the satellites' orbits lie in planes parallel to the ecliptic.
Galileo struggled to avoid the fact by converting it to an effect of perspective;
but, as he said elsewhere, nature prefers its way to ours. Fortunately he was
spared witnessing Mayr's names for the satellites-lo, Europa, Ganymede,
Callisto-supersede "Medici stars." In accusing Mayr ("myoId adversary,
and invidious enemy not only of me, but of the entire human race"), Gali­
leo neglected that Mayr reported many things that he could not have stolen
from the starry messenger."?
In his old fight with Capra, Galileo had condemned the theft of intellectual
property as worse than murder. With your life you lose interest in everything
else, while the victim of the theft of intellectual property feels constantly the
loss of "the honor, fame, and merited glory, which he obtained not by inher­
itance or from nature, fate, or chance, but from [his] own studies, efforts,
and long vigils."!" Galileo had not hidden his views about plagiarism. How
then could he not have foreseen Scheiner's likely reaction at thinking himself
classed among the thieves, or the Roman College's anger at seeing one of its
professors staged as too perfect an imbecile for this imperfect world? The
Assayer amused Calileo's friends, multiplied his enemies, and brought him
new readers who could appreciate the brilliance of the style and the asides

MISCALCULATED RISKS
247
that have made excerpts from it chestnuts in the history of science and in the
teaching of Italian literature.
Perhaps the most celebrated of these famous asides is the admonition
that philosophy is not fiction, as, for polemical purposes, Galileo has Sarsi
think, not a romance like the Iliad or Orlando Furioso, "books in which the
least important thing is whether what is written in them is true."!" Oh, no,
Sig. Sarsi, "Philosophy is written in this grand book-I mean the universe­
which stands continually open to our gaze. It is written in the language of
mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical
figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word
of it." This famous dictum too is a fiction, to which Galileo clung and on
which he built: triangles and circles do not take you far in the analysis of
nature. Historians have pointed to Plato's creation story Timaeus as a prob­
able source for Galilee's reduction of nature to elementary geometrical fig­
ures, although Timaeus had in mind that the particles of which he supposed
the elements composed had the shape of the regular (or Platonic) solids. Since
the faces of these five solids are either triangles or polygons reducible to tri­
angles, Timaeus managed a metaphorical triangulation of the universe.!"
But it is more likely that Galileo had in mind the matter in hand, which was
a criticism of Sarsi-Grassi for slavishly following Tycho, who, in Galileo's
version of the facts, could not tell a triangle from an icosohedron.
To annihilate Tycho's reputation completely, to expose his "foolish fab­
rication" and "fantasies," Galileo derided the demonstration indicated in
(Figure 6.3). A and B represent Copenhagen and Prague, 0 a fixed star. Tycho

made DAB a right angle, and so it is, very near, since OCB is a right angle
and the chord AB virtually zero in comparison to the distance 00. Since the
difference in latitude between A and B is 6°, LAOO = LZAO = 3°. The zenith
distance of the star 0 at Copenhagen therefore had to be 3°. Tycho errone­
ously wrote that 0 fell in the constellation Aquila, the Eagle, whose zenith
distance when on the meridian at Copenhagen is over 48°. Hence, eagle-eyed
Galileo deduced, Tycho did not know even the rudiments of geometry, and
Sarsi, whose supposed errors in mathematics Galileo delighted to catalogue,
was a fool to follow him. "Sig. Sarsi, philosophy is not fiction."!" That was
too much for Kepler. The Imperial Mathematician countered that in his haste
Tycho had made use of a diagram he had drawn for one purpose for another,
and had written down the wrong star. But there was nothing wrong with his
geometry!"
"To return to the subject," as Galileo often had to say to the virtually
present Cesarini, a second famous aside from the Assayer tells the tale of a
hermit who knew musical sounds only from bird calls. One day he decided
to go back to civilization. He soon discovered musical instruments, sing­
ing crickets, and many other sources of pleasing sounds. "Thereupon his
knowledge was reduced to such diffidence that when asked how sounds
are generated he used to reply tolerantly that although he knew some of
the ways, he was certain that many more existed which were unknown and
unimaginable."!" Galileo accepted that humans could not attain to a Theory
of Everything, but not the implication of modesty in pursuit of what might
be knowable. True philosophers find truth without fanfare. Like eagles, they
fly alone and are seldom seen. The crowd of philosophers know no truth and
flock like starlings: "[they] fill the sky with shrieks and cries wherever they
settle, and befoul the earth beneath them." Kepler was an eagle, a strong and
independent intellect, but very different in his philosophy from Galileo. That
was to be expected. Eagles are loners. Thence arises a significant problem.
Being an eagle will become increasingly challenging as previous eagles leave
ever fewer discoverable truths. "Hence the less attractive [science] will be,
and the smaller will be the number of its followers." The number of disgust­
ing chattering starlings will grow, however, since magnificent claims, falla­
cies, frauds, and chimeras will always be more popular than true knowledge
and the number of fools is infinite.':" The vast domain of the unknowable
will remain the domain of the Super Eagle, God Himself, to whom alone all
things are known.!"

"Well, Your Excellency, let us turn to substantive matters." Sarsi had tried
to reply to Cuiducci's quibble that a telescope lengthened to see things up
close is not the same instrument it was when shortened to view distant
objects. What was Sarsi's reply? A trombone is the same instrument what­
ever the position of the slide! What a sophism! Would Sarsi say that a short
thick organ pipe that sounds a low note is the same as a long thin one made
from it that sounds a higher one? Who knows. Would Galileo say that the
lute he is playing multiplied into different instruments as he stopped the
strings at different frets? As we know, this silly argument covered an embar­
rassment. Although Galileo understood the justice of Sarsi's explanation
of the light-gathering capacity of telescopes, he could not admit that it was
the effective cause of the promotion of stars from invisible to perceptible
status. He may have worried that conceding this point would have called
into question not only his omniscience but also the reliability of discoveries
interpreted through his understanding of the working of his telescopes."?
His dismissal of poor Sarsi is pure bombast. After remarking, correctly, that
the telescope gathers light and magnifies simultaneously, Galileo wrongly
concludes that if one of these processes gives a perceptible effect, so must
the other. "In order to hold a different opinion, [Sarsi] would be obliged to
show that the telescope sometimes unites the rays [gathers light] without
enlarging the angle [magnifying], but that this happens only when the fixed
stars are being observed. This he will never show to the end of time, for it is
a most foolish fiction, or, to be blunt, a falsification."?" Thus Galileo cleverly
made his mathematical error into his adversary's moral failing. Cleverly? It
may be that Galileo truly did not understand how his telescope made invis­
ible stars visible.'?'
In a related error, Galileo berated earlier astronomers for not noticing
that the angular diameters they assigned the planets were much too large.
As usual, he converted error into sin, "hardly excusable," nay "inexcusable."
Kepler replied that as the old star gazers lacked telescopes to identify and
remove the irradiation that had misled them, they had no reason or way to
attack the problem.':" With the telescope, Galileo had determined that Venus'
apparent size varies by a factor of 40 and that of Mars by a factor of 60 owing
to changes in distance and phase, and, to emphasize the importance of the
finding, he had advertised that it destroyed the Ptolemaic system. Kepler
countered that all the competing systems predicted changes in the size of
planetary disks and that phases, not sizes, cooked the Ptolemaic goose.""

250
GALILEO
With Ptolemy dethroned and Copernicus prohibited, Tycho would seem to
have no competition in Italy. Galileo tried to defeat this logic by removing
Tycho from the competition: his was not a serious system, but a sketch and a
caricature of one. Kepler observed that it had the same status as its competi­
tors, as it was an amalgam of the twO.194 Here Galileo opened himself to the
same ridicule to which he subjected Sarsi. Be sure, Sig. Sarsi, when attacking
a position to make it as strong as you can; otherwise its supporters will deny
they held it as you describe it and slip away, leaving you stunned and empty­
handed, like Ruggiero trying to grasp the invisible Angelica.'?'
There remained the charge of Copernicanism that Sarsi insinuated lay in
or behind Galileo's cometary theory. To repudiate it, Galileo insisted that
since he had admitted that he did not know the cause that might save the
theory he presented as a mere possibility, he did not understand how Sarsi
could know that that cause was motion. The decree of 1616 had foreclosed
this possibility: it remained only to demolish Kepler's claim that every comet
is a proof of the Copernican system.':" Well Sig. Sarsi? Can you do it? If you
cannot, "If the movement attributed to the earth (which I, as a Catholic and
pious person, consider to be most false and vain) lends itself to yielding expla­
nations for so many widely diverse appearances observed in the heavenly
bodies, then I should not be sure that so false a thing might not deceptively
correspond with the appearances of the cornet."!" Some unknown person
perceived this cloudy statement as a defense of Copernicus and referred it
to the Holy Office. The task of evaluation ended in the hands of Giovanni di
Guevara, a learned man close to the Barberinis and the lynxes. The matter
went no further.':"
Galilee's response to the third weighing, in which Sarsi fielded experi­
ments in defense of Aristotle's cometary theory, yielded two golden asides
dear to Galileists. One concerns the stories Sarsi yanked from antiquity
about the melting of arrow points and the cooking of eggs. If you want
to know how flying arrows heat up, Galileo advised Sarsi, you must read
your Ariosto. Observe the clash of Mandricardo and Ruggiero. So violent
was their collision that the splinters of their lances burst into flames-not
because of the friction of the air, but because the impact carried the debris
into the sphere of fire, from which it fell back incandescent, "[as the histo­
rian] Turpin writes, truthfully at this point."!" After this deft exploitation
of Ariosto's irony, Galileo applied an equally light logic to egg cookery.
Sig. Sarsi, he said, I've tried the experiment and it failed. Rather than doubt

MISCALCULATED RISKS
251
ancient authority, however, which would be presumptuous, we must
assume that our experiments omitted something present in theirs. "Now
we do not lack eggs, or slings, or sturdy fellows to whirl them ... And since
nothing is lacking to us but being Babylonians, then being Babylonians is
the cause of the eggs hardening.'?"
"Now, Your Excellency, to return to the matter at hand ... " The second
famous aside digresses from a long argument against Aristotle's claim that
motion creates heat. Balderdash, screeches the eagle, the dissolution of solid
bodies releases the very fine particles of fire they contain, and these, on pen­
etrating animal bodies, produce within them the sensation of heat. When
the dissolution occurs via friction, it might be said, though improperly, that
motion causes heat. In every case, however, part of some body must be con­
sumed, and a fine emanation released, for warming to occur. This was all
Galileo needed to argue that a comet cannot be a dry exhalation ignited by
motion through the air, since in the process no solid body disintegrates.?"
He did not stop here, however, but applied his insight into heat to consume
the foundations of Aristotelian physics. "Your Excellency ... , I must give
some consideration to what we call 'heat', for I suspect in general people
have a conception of this which is very remote from the truth." They think,
with Aristotle, that it is a "real attribute, property, and quality which actually
resides in the material by which we feel ourselves warrned.v'"
In fact, fire particles possess no qualities but shape, motion, and size. We
manufacture the sensation of heat when they pervade our bodies, a pleasant
warmth or a disagreeable pain depending on their speed and numbers. It is
exactly the same with odor and taste, only the particles have sizes and shapes
different from those of fire. Sound is merely our ears' response to vibrations
of the air. As to vision, it is caused by the ultimate atoms of fire. 203 In the spe­
cial vocabulary applied to Calileo's distinctions, motion, shape, and size are
"primary qualities" and the sensations they produce in our minds through
our senses, "secondary qualities." The distinction goes back to the ancient
atomists whose theory Aristotle had rejected for a fistful of good, though not
unanswerable arguments. Philosophers began to flirt seriously with atom­
ism again in the sixteenth century. The Catholic church did not like it, as it
smacked of materialism and had no obvious place for an immortal soul. As
will appear, Galilee's enemies were not slow to capitalize on this latest of his
hostages to fortune, with which they would associate the particulate struc­
ture of water in On floating bodies.

252
GALILEO
As a practiced propagandist, Galileo knew the value of repetition. Through­
out the Assayer he uses words like "puerile" and "childish" to characterize Sar­
si's arguments; accuses him, sometimes justly, of misrepresenting Guiducci;
and constantly refers to Sarsi's errors, "repeated error[ s ]."204 Of these the one
hardest hit is, of course, Galileo's own mistake about the angular width of a
naked star. Galileo ends his five weighings with an inspired account of the
effectiveness of the telescope in removing irradiation as a function of the
size of the enlarged image. For planets the removal is complete. For even
the grandest star, the dog star, a little fulgor remains. Do you not agree then,
Sarsi, that invisible stars become visible by enlargement, just as the planets
are magnified? How can you not agree? You must agree, Sarsi. "Therefore
yield, and be silent.'?" That is the way a knight does science.
Grassi rejoined nonetheless, but Galileo did not again deign to contest the
sword of Orlando with him. Very pugnacious marginal comments in Gali­
leo's copy of Grassi's Ratio (1626) show, however, that Galileo condescended
to wrestle with him in private. In public Galileo had no need to take further
action, since the lynxes judged that he had saved their honor and his. Cesi
wrote, "I think that everyone knows full well that your Lordship has no need
to joust, or obligation to enter any arena ... Mons. Ciampoli agrees, as do
other courtiers and literati who love and esteem [your] work.'?"

Vainglory
Pope Gregory XV died on 8 July 1623. Eleven days later, having heard Ciam­
poli deliver the sermon traditionally given to prepare them for the task, 54
cardinals undertook to determine whom among them God wanted to lead
them all. The conclave, protracted for 18 days in sweltering heat, was a trial
of the fittest. Eight cardinals did not survive the ordeal. Finally the Span­
ish faction yielded and the Francophile Christian humanist Maffeo Barberini
emerged as Pope Urban VIII. Ciampoli had not known his own strength. "My
oration had ... a better result than I could have hoped for."
7.1 THE POPE
Any competent astrologer who knew Barberini's geniture could have com­
puted his success. The sun, the lord of his horoscope, stood just beyond
the midheaven, regarding at trine the rise of the solar constellation Leo and
happily aspected by Jupiter and the moon. When the conclave began, Bar­
berini's sun dawdled in Cancer while the cardinal nephews of the previous
two popes maneuvered Borromeo, del Monte, and other aging favorites, and
ignored their healthy young colleague Barberini. As the sun moved into Leo
and conjunction with Jupiter and Saturn, and malaria thinned the electorate,
the heavens spoke and so did the cardinals. Habemus papam! The new pope,
who took the name Urban in reference to his and Rome's urbanity, left the
253

254
GALILEO
conclave more certain than ever of his solar lineage. He had an image of the
sun painted on a wall of his bedroom in the Vatican to collect solar rays and
remind him of his power.'
Literary Rome was ecstatic at the rise of the poetical pope. The "marve­
lous conjuncture" (as Galileo put it, in reference to the happy event and the
astrological signs) returned to the Holy See a knowledgeable and generous,
indeed, a spendthrift patron of the arts. Urban's combined income as head of
the Roman Catholic Church, and, as he liked to be styled, "King of Rome," was
around 2.5 million scudi annually. The principal beneficiaries were his broth­
ers and nephews, three of whom he transformed into cardinals, others into
dukes, princes, and governors. Altogether they consumed around 12 million
scudi (25 per cent!) of papal income during the two decades of Urban's reign.
And this was perhaps no more than a tenth of the total proceeds from ben­
efices, bribes, fees, retainers, and the pope's pocket. The most powerful of
Urban's relatives, the cardinal nephew Francesco Barberini, was an ideal alter
ego of the egoistic pope: an intelligent, reliable, and resourceful executor of
his uncle's wishes, he was a humanist in his own right, an excellent scholar
in Latin and Greek, a patron of the arts and sciences, and the owner of the
largest library in Rome after the Vatican.' In acknowledgement of Francesco
Barberini's achievements and the hope of his protection, Cesi invited him to
join the lynxes; in confirmation of the Barberinis' closeness to the academy
and the new regime's respect for learning, he graciously accepted. Further
to togetherness, the cardinale nipote took lynx Cassiano dal Pozzo, one of
the editors of the Assayer, as his private secretary, and since dal Pozzo was a
knowledgeable botanist, his chief gardener,"
Friends who came to congratulate Urban did not go away empty-handed.
Although he claimed to have little to bestow, the deaths of the cardinals mar­
tyred in the recent conclave freed substantial assets for redistribution.' Among
the old friends thus rewarded were Giovan Battista Strozzi, who derived a
double benefit from his visit to the Vatican. The pope gave him a pension of
300 scudi and Strozzi took away a like amount from his protégé Ciampoli,
whose lavish lifestyle under the new regime he did not approve. Ciampoli
objected to this retrenchment not because he needed the money but because
he was dependent entirely on Urban and the few hundred scudi he received as
a canon of Saint Peters. And Urban was not 100 percent reliable."
Another old friend who came to pay his respects and collect his reward was
Buonarroti, who, like Strozzi, judged the new court guilty of excess. "Music

VAINGLORY
255
always and always poetry I music and poetry morning and night I music in
every time and season." "I would rather hear frogs sing.'? Many of Urban's
own poems figured in this musak, in settings by Johannes Kapsburger, the
lutanist who wrote the music for Grassi's opera." The pope grew excessively
fond of his verses. Buonarroti again: "He raised me up [from the obligatory
genuflection] and recited to me a hundred of his poems, paraphrases or
translations of the psalms." Buonarroti requested copies. "He referred me
to Monsignor Ciampoli, who distributed them as if they were orders on the
treasury,"? At Urban's court, according to the poet Agostino Mascardi, "cul­
tivating literature is not a matter of decorum but of necessity." Not all poetry,
of course. Marino had hurried from Paris to Rome after Urban's election
with his new Adonis in hand. Its earthiness did not suit the pious classicism
of the new Parnassus, however, and he soon left for his native Naples. L'Adone
earned the honor of a place on the Index and on Urban's list of exemplary
bad poems. The pope did not want a rival as strong as Marino in Rome."
Urban's vanity about his poems, like his belief in astrology, opened him to
damaging manipulation.
The extent of the Barberinis' promotion of the decorative arts may
be gauged from the swarm of painted and sculptured bees in Rome, over
10,000 by a contemporary estimate, and by such masterworks as Bernini's
baldachino over the main altar of St. Peters and that immense monument to
nepotism, the Palazzo Barberini, now the Galleria Nazionale d'Arre Antica.
The main public room in this palace boasts an immense painted ceiling
depicting Divine Providence in the act of arranging Urban's bees, keys, and
tiara (Plate 13). The pope rated the ceiling, completed in 1638 after six years
of work, as the equal of Raphael's stanze in the Vatican."
To the heavy expenses of peace Urban soon added the grievous burdens
of war. He strengthened Castel Sant'Angelo and built or rebuilt frontier for­
tresses. They functioned more as staging for theft than as strongholds for
defense. In his need for money Urban did not disdain to rob his neighbors.
The first to suffer was the Grand Duke of Tuscany, not Cosimo, alas, who
had died in 1620, but in effect his mother Christina, who would dominate
the government until the heir, Ferdinando II, came of age in 1628.12 Although
Ferdinando did not care to oppose his bigoted grandmother in matters of
religion, he attempted to block Urban's theft of the Duchy of Urbino, which
he claimed through his betrothed child-wife Vittoria della Rovere and
other dynastic ties. Christina's acquiescence in the pope's rejection of her

GALILEO
grandson's claim dashed all protests. Urban tried to repeat the adventure,
with disastrous financial consequences, in Castro and Mantua."
"Whereas Clement VIII was usually found with the works of Saint Ber­
nard, and Paul V with the writings of the blessed Justinian of Venice, Urban
VIII had the latest poems or plans for fortifications on his work table." Thus
Leopold Ranke characterized the difference between Barberini and his
immediate predecessors, juxtaposing his humanism and his hardness, his
devotion to the arts and his ambition for power. Obsessed with being, and
showing, himself a great prince, he declined advice, made decisions capri­
ciously, and suffered from mood swings." A poet who took 500 pages to
summarize Urban's virtues ends with an unwittingly apt figure: "With sweet
urbanity he plans to rule the world / ... / And thus intending, he takes the
name of Urban / From the far west to the Indian Ocean / The world is urban,
and the heavens echo "Urbano."15 Since "urbano" also signified "of the city,"
urbanizing the world meant imposing papal Rome upon it. The powerful
Spanish colony in Rome led by the belligerent Cardinal Borgia did not care
for this vision of empire under a Francophile pope. No more did it please the
Society of Jesus, whose saintly founder, several of its generals, and many of
its members were Spaniards." Their quarrel with Urban chanced to come to
a head during Galileo's final bout with the Holy Office.
Galileo had shared the enthusiasm of the literati and lynxes at the dawn
of the new age and hastened to fulfill Urban's expectation of a congratula­
tory visit. Perhaps he did not know that one of Urban's first acts had been
to pressure the Venetians into foregoing a great monument to Paolo Sarpi,
who died in January 1623- It was not regard for Sarpi, however, that delayed
Galileo's trip for almost a year but, as usual, bad health and bad weather."
The lynxes kept his person and projects in Urban's mind by making the
pope the dedicatee of the Assayer of "our Galileo, the Florentine discoverer
not of new lands but of hitherto unseen portions of the heavens, containing
investigations of those celestial splendors that usually attend great wonders."
Ciampoli read Urban choice passages from the Assayer during dinner. The
pope enjoyed the hits at the Jesuits, read the rest of the book himself, and
expressed his admiration and affection for its author."
Galileo interrupted his journey to Rome at Acquasparta to rest and plan
with Cesi. During his stay there he received the news that Cesarini, who
had written of his ardent desire to see Galileo again, had at last succumbed
to his illness." Cesarini's sad and early death squeezed from his inseparable

VAINGLORY
257
companion Ciampoli a rare expresson of real emotion. "I had hoped [he
wrote Cardinal Archbishop Borromeo ] that our feeling for one another
would become an example at court and would be known throughout Italy,
showing the envious and quarrelsome that collaboration in literature is a
bond of love, not a cause of discord." Cesarini's death was also a great blow
to the cause of the Assayer.2o It brought to light hairline cracks in the bonds
among the lynxes and between them and the Barberini. Cesarini had asked
to be buried in Jesuit garb in a Jesuit church. Unknown to his friends, he had
dickered schizophrenically with the Jesuit General Vitelleschi for privileged
entry into the order while negotiating the imprimatur for Calileo's mali­
cious attack on it. A Jesuit lynx was, by Lincean ordinance, an oxymoron.
Thus the internal crack. Externally, Cesi wanted to implement his cousin's
request for a modest, if not Jesuit burial, and Urban wanted to erect a grand
monument advertising his favorite's rare literary accomplishments. Cesi
objected: since the society of lynxes ranked high above the literary acad­
emies of Rome in subject and aspiration, it would not do to give them equal
billing on Cesarini's tombstone. And since many of these literary academi­
cians were courtiers, and ran "a great peril of falling into the despicable
role of parasites or buffoons," they were not fit associates for a lynx dead
or alive. The prince and the pope compromised by burying Cesarini in a
dignified non-Jesuit setting (the Sala dei Capitani in the Palazzo dei Con­
servatori), under a marble that does not mention academies." As is often
the case, compromise created coolness between the compromisers."
7.2 THE KNIGHT
Third Roman campaign
Urban treated Galileo papally, gave him six private interviews, two medals, a
promise of a pension for his son Vincenzo, and, at parting, a jumble of gifts
of diverse value. These included a picture of unknown nature, two medals,
a sackful of Agnus Dei specially blessed by Urban, and an ornate letter, writ­
ten by Ciampoli, to Grand Duke Ferdinand II praising Galilee's genius and
piety." He did not obtain what he wanted, however, which was permission
to reopen the Copernican question." He tried to get a reading from several
cardinals. One of them, Frederick Eitel von Zollern, sounded out Urban.

GALILEO
He reported that the pope believed that the church had not and would not
condemn the Copernican theory as heretical. The pontifical reasoning as
rendered by the cardinal showed no relaxation from the position Barberini
had taken in 1616: there being no truth in the way astronomy saves the acci­
dents we see in the heavens, it made no sense to say that any of its systems
was wrong, let alone heretical. 25
In February of 1624, Cesarini had written Galileo that Father Monster
Riccardi desired the honor of his acquaintance. They met in Cardinal von
Zollern's rooms in late May. Lynx Faber too was present. Riccardi agreed with
the pope that Copernicanism was not a matter of faith and that astronomical
systems could not be right or wrong. He advised taking no advantage of these
epistemological truths, however, since a discussion of Copernicus would
only "rekindle a debate that has died down." As a censor who preferred peace
to precision, he recommended leaving the motion and arrangement of the
planets to the angels." Riccardi advised further that if Galileo could not keep
his peace, he should write out his ideas in such a way as to give no opening
to his enemies. Father Monster did not know Galileo very well.
Whenever Galileo visited Rome he displayed wonders: improvements
on Archimedes in 1586, telescopic marvels in 1611, show-off disputations in
1615/16, and now, in 1624, gigantic insects. He had with him a compound
microscope that he had perfected, again, as with the telescope, proceeding
from a Dutch original. Faber looked through it before Galileo gave it to Car­
dinal von Zollern for delivery to Maximilian of Bavaria. "I examined a fly
that Galileo showed me [Faber wrote Cesi]; astonished, I said to him that it
was another creator since it brought things into view whose existence previ­
ously was unknown." In the fall of 1624, Galileo sent Cesi a better instrument
and an indication of its merits. "I've beheld a great many tiny animals with
infinite surprise. Among them the flea is most horrible, the mosquito and
the moth very beautiful; and with great pleasure I've observed how flies and
other little animals walk on mirrors ... "27
The lynxes soon turned their fortified eyes to the little animals of great­
est interest in Barberini Rome. Combining their interest in natural sciences,
a reference to their most famous member, and an obeisance to their great
patron, they published a beautifully engraved broadside, Melissographia, for
the Jubilee of 1625 featuring magnified images of a bee observed by Stelluti.
The dedication mentions "the divine discovery of the new art," the genius of
the lineei, and, of course, the bees in Barberini's bonnet. The lynxes could not

VAINGLORY
259
leave them alone. Soon after the broadsheet they brought out a Latin poem
entitled Apes Dianiae (Diana's bees) illustrated with engravings of bee-bearing
ancient coins. The bond between the insect and the huntress was chastity,
bees being supposed sexless and Diana doubling as goddess of continence.
Both therefore projected the "chaste and virginal model" that Urban culti­
vated. The poem admirably instances the control of literary form prized by
the men among whom Galileo made his career. A third, mighty variant on
the bee theme, a gigantic broadsheet measuring 167 by 70 cm, the Apiarium
of 1626, decorates a treasury of literary, artistic, and scientific information
about bees with arcane references to classical learning and outrageous com­
pliments to Urban. The pope could not look at his escutcheon without being
reminded of lynxes and, as they put it in their Melissographia, "the power of
polished glass.'?"
Back in Florence in manic mood, Galileo decided that his discussions in
Rome did indicate that an essay or two, written in his unprovocative way,
might gain a new hearing for Copernicus. Two trial balloons resulted. One
was an important improvement in the theory of the tides, which removed the
obvious objection that it had no place for the moon and fashioned it into the
capstone of the great work on cosmology Galileo hoped to publish under
the catchy title, On the tides. The second balloon was an answer to Francesco
Ingoli, the author of the corrections to Copernicus issued in 1620.
On the tides is a dialogue between the resurrected (Salviati and Sagredo)
and the unredeemable (Simplicio). After rehearsing the tidal theory we
know, Salviati allows that it cannot be the whole story as it does not explain
the monthly variation, spring tides at full and new moon, neap tides at the
quarters. How does the moon influence the cause of the tides, the diurnal
and annual motions of the earth? "[H]ow many hours, how many days, and
how many more nights I spent on these reflections; and how often, despair­
ing of ever understanding it, I tried to console myself by being convinced,
like the unhappy Orlando, that that could not be true which had neverthe­
less been brought before my very eyes!'?"
The reference is to Orlando's discovery of abundant evidence of Angelica's
perfidy, which he tried to explain away, "deceiving himself with far-fetched
notions," "searching in his mind a thousand ways for not believing what he
could not help believe/'" Orlando could not square his discovery of the facts
with his theory of Angelica and went mad. Sagredo: "Thank God for not let­
ting you [go the way of] Orlando," or of Aristotle either, who, according to

260
GALILEO
unreliable testimony, jumped into the sea from frustration at not being able
to understand its motions." Aristotle would not have drowned himself had
he known the pendulum clock. Attend to it and the problem of the monthly
tide evaporates. A pendulum beats faster the shorter its length; a planet goes
slower the greater its orbit. Let the earth-moon system be the bob of a pendu­
lum. When the moon lies between the earth and the sun (at conjunction) the
effective pendulum is shorter than when the moon is in opposition. Hence
the pair moves more quickly around new than around full moon. Salviati:
"From this it may be clear that the annual movement of the earth in its orbit
along the ecliptic is not uniform, and that its irregularity derives from the
moon and has its periods and restorations monthly.'?' Sagredo: "You, Sal­
viati, have guided me step by step so gently that I am astonished to find I have
arrived with so little effort at a height which I believed impossible to obtain."
Against this singular solution was the little difficulty raised by Sagredo that
astronomers had not noticed any consequences of the supposed monthly
variation in the annual motion. Salviati: they have not looked and the effect
may be small. 33
Two of Galileo's prevailing misjudgments as a natural philosopher come
into view again here. Neglecting physical cause, he advanced his pendulum
analogy, which was no more than a metaphor, as an explanation. What is it
that binds the earth and moon so strongly together that they act as a single
pendulum bob? Galileo liked the analogy all the more for this weakness. In
the paradoxical way he loved, it gave the moon a role in the drama of the tides
"without [its] having anything to do with oceans and with waters.'?" It also
allowed him to sidestep the hidden connection between the lunar motions
and the diurnal tides, and to rap Kepler, who, "though he had at his finger­
tips the motions attributed to the earth ... has nevertheless leant his assent
to the moon's dominion over the waters."35 The second of Galileo's endur­
ing misjudgments also concerned Kepler. The arguments from which Kepler
deduced the elliptical form of the earth's orbit ruled out Galileo's monthly
variation as a cause of the inequalities of the earth's motion."
Galileo did not intend his definitive account of the tides as just another
bizzarria. As if in dialogue with Urban, Salviati asserted the impossibility of
any other explanation while conceding that the difference in simultaneous
accelerations of the two ends of a seabed, on which the explanation rested,
was most "remarkable." He also faced up to the uncomfortable question
whether the diurnal motion alone could produce tides. To obtain the desired

VAINGLORY
261
answer, Galileo made the gratuitous assumption that without a considera­
ble annual velocity the oceans would accommodate themselves to the spin
and cease to slosh. In a final application of the theory, Salviati beautifully
explains an imaginary annual variation in the strength of the tides arising
from the alignments of the diurnal and annual motions at the solstices and
equinoxes." No more can be known about the "fixed and constant" causes
of the tides except that theories invoking forces acting directly on the water
are vain imaginings:
These are so far from being actual or possible causes of the tides
that the very contrary is true. The tides are the cause of them; that
is, make them occur to mentalities better equipped for loquacity and
ostentation than for reflections upon and investigations into the most
hidden works of nature. Rather than being reduced to offering those
wise, clever and modest words, "I do not know," they hasten to wag
their tongues and even their pens in the wildest absurdities."
This was the biggest bluff of Galileo's career.
Having thus made his theory of the tides sufficient (Copernican motions
are enough), necessary (no other will do), and offensive, Galileo could turn
his attention to countering objections to a moving earth. A convenient target
existed in an essay composed by Ingoli as a follow-up to their dispute in
Rome in the winter of 1615/16. Since then Ingoli had made a career harrowing
Copernican astronomy. He had become a small hero for sustaining a coun­
terattack by Kepler, who dismissed his theological arguments and referred
him to the Epitome of Copernican astronomy, which Kepler had just published,
for answers to his mathematical and physical objections. Ingoli responded
by engineering the condemnation of the Epitome by the Congregation of the
Index. Thus he continued to prosper. When Galileo decided to tackle him in
1624, he held the conspicuous position of secretary to the Congregation for
the Propagation of the Faith set up by Pope Gregory XV in 1622.19 A client of
the Ludovisi, the benefactors of the Jesuits, Ingoli made a good target for a
Copernican who did not fear the consequences.
Galileo motivated his attack as a defense of the reputations of Italian
astronomy and Catholic theology. By showing that Ingoli's physical argu­
ments had no force, Galileo would demonstrate to heretics that the Holy
Office had not condemned Copernicus from a misunderstanding of the
natural world. It had made its decision solely on the basis of scripture. "We

GALILEO
Catholics continue to be certain of the old truth taught us by the sacred
authors, not for lack of scientific understanding, or for not having studied
so many arguments, experiments, observations, and demonstrations as they
have, but rather because of the reverence we have toward the writings of our
Fathers and because of our zeal in religion and faith."? This pious pretence
recurs in the preface to the Dialogue.
The first of Ingoli's arguments will suggest the level of most of the rest. It
attempted to prove that Copernicus' theory required that the sun be closer to
the earth than the moon-a silly argument based on word play and a bizarre
definition of parallax. Galileo opposed a lengthy, crystal-clear account of par­
allax (yet againl)." A quibble by Ingoli over heaviness and its natural place
produced something more interesting: all the planets, including the sun, have
heavy parts tending to their centers; the question was, which center coincided
with the center of the system. Galileo knew: the sun. "I have other evidences
not previously observed by anyone [how would he know that?], which are
necessarily convincing, about the certainty of the Copernican opinion." Mad
Orlando had returned. And immediately returned to his senses: "'necessarily
convincing' [Galileo added] as long as we remain within the limits of human
and scientific inquiry.'?"
Ingoli had brought up the standard physical objections to a spinning earth
and claimed in proof the malleable experiment of the rock let go from the
mast of a moving ship. Galileo countered with the doctrine that everything
on the earth participates in its motion, towers, loose balls, falling rocks,
clouds, and birds; the experiment of the rock-and-mast did not destroy but
confirmed the doctrine of shared motion. Then Galileo proposed a thought
experiment worthy of Einstein. Enclose yourself, a friend, a jar dripping
water vertically into a pot, a tank of fish, and a flock of small winged crea­
tures in the cabin of a docked ship. Play catch, jump back and forth, and
observe that the fish and flying things move easily in all directions. Now sup­
pose the ship under sail at constant speed. Everything will remain as before:
the jumping, ball throwing, flying, and swimming still take place as easily
toward the prow as toward the stern, and the water continues to drip verti­
cally." Galileo imagines Ingoli's objecting that, as no wind exists to drive
the heavy earth through the celestial spaces, the thought experiment is irrel­
evant. "Ah Sig. Ingoli," Galileo replies to his straw man, "you are incapable
of stripping yourself of the old ideas impressed in your mind, and so you
confuse heaven and earth and utter great inanities.'?" Circular motion is the

VAINGLORY
"congenital, proper, and completely natural behavior" of spherical bodies,
their "natural, primary and eternal inclination." A big heavy sphere like the
earth should enjoy trouble-free constant spin and revolution until it pleases
God to end its existence."
The campaign aborted
A few straws in the Roman wind in 1624 showed that it had not veered in
Galileo's direction. In the autumn, in the well-attended ceremony for the reo­
pening of classes at the Roman College, the main speaker compared freelance
philosophers and mathematicians who placed themselves above tradition to
the builders of Babel, spreaders of confusion, men who put the satisfaction
of their vanity above the interests of Christian solidarity. And did so when
Catholicism once again confronted heresy in the Gcrmanies!" On 21 Decem­
ber a great sower of confusion and discord, Archbishop Marc Antonio de
Dominis, was burnt in Rome together with his books. Fortunately for him,
he had been dead for three months. He had also been a mathematician, a pal
of Paolo Sarpi, and an apostate. He had fled to England, embraced reformed
religion, and received, as a sinner saved, the high post of Dean of Windsor.
There he made history by helping to publish Sarpi's anti-Roman History of
the Council of Trent. Troubled by the weather and perhaps his conscience, de
Dominis returned to Rome in 1622, recanted, and again received the benefits
of the saved sinner. For a short time he prospered. He resumed his arch­
bishopric and published a book on, of all things, the tides, for which Grassi
served as censor. A persistent interviewer from the Holy Office teased from
him that he did not hold entirely to the Tridentine decrees and thought that
a reunion of the Christian churches might be possible. Incarceration in the
Castel Sant'Angelo rewarded his frankness. He died while awaiting trial. On
papal authority, and in response to an uncharitable suspicion of poisoning,
lynx Faber conducted an autopsy. What he left of de Dominis was burnt in
the Campo dei Fiori."
A third straw was Grassi's furious reaction to the Assayer. Stellutti had
witnessed it, in a bookstore. Grassi was a dangerous enemy. He had guile,
ingenuity, and courage, all displayed in the ancient Roman setting of his
opera on the Jesuit saints and the original design of his church in the Roman
College. Today the most interesting feature of San Ignazio to most visitors
is the persuasive fake cupola painted on the inside of its flat roof. Grassi had

GALILEO
not designed a canvas trompe l'oeil to finish off his masterwork, however, but
a huge dome that would have blocked the morning light from the library of
the Dominicans and outdo the huge headpiece of the Theatines' church of
San Andrea della Valle." That was to take on too many powerful enemies
at once. Would he answer the Assayer? Galileo asked Guiducci to find out.
Grassi turned the tables by calling on Guiducci, declaring a wish to end hos­
tilities, and extracting the information that Galileo was more attached than
ever to his theory of the tides. In return, Grassi confided the dis information
that he would reply to the Assayer without raising any new questions. Galileo
felt himself outmaneuvered. Ciampoli advised against delivering the inflam­
matory letter to Ingoli. The Roman lineei, who now included the belletrist
Guiducci, put Galilean matters on hold."
Grassi's response brought something new and worrisome." It suggested
that Galileo's discussion of primary and secondary qualities committed him
to atomism and hence to a theory incompatible with Tridentine canons con­
cerning the sacred sacrament of the eucharist. The canons read, in an appro­
priately baroque translation:
Canon 1. If anyone denieth that, in the sacrament of the most holy
Eucharist are contained truly, really, and substantially the
body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently the whole Christ; but
saith that He is only therein as in a sign, or in figure, or virtue;
let him be anathema.
Canon 2. If anyone ... denieth that wonderful and singular conversion
of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, and of the
whole substance of wine into the Blood-the species only of
the bread and wine remaining-which conversion the Cath­
olic Church most aptly calls Transubstantiation; let him be
anathema."
Grassi capitalized on the menace of the tone of the whole and the mystery of
the phrase, "the species only of the bread and wine remaining."
The species signifies the properties of the bread and wine supposed to
persist after the priest's incantation, Hoc est corpus meum. The Aristotelian
system possesses technical terms in which the miracle can be dressed up to
appear less magical. A piece of bread unites certain "substantial qualities"

VAINGLORY
that characterize it as bread with "accidental qualities" like size, color, place,
and savor that distinguish it from all other pieces. Transubstantiation pre­
serves the accidents while transforming the substance of the bread. What
could be clearer? If, however, there are no such entities as real accidents (size,
color, savor) but only the substantial primary qualities of size, motion, and
arrangement claimed by the atomists, canon 2 cannot be fulfilled and the
atomist must be anathema. An anonymous denouncer pointed out to the
Holy Office the ominous bearing of Galilee's primary-secondary distinction
on the Tridentine teaching. Pietro Redondi, the historian who discovered this
document, attributed it to Grassi, who, however, had no reason to play the
sneak since he had pu-blished the problem through his alter ego Sarsi. The
accusation did not go far at the time, probably owing to the intervention of
Francesco Barberini. Nonetheless Sarsi's insinuation that Calileo's teachings
subverted a fundamental Tridentine decree alarmed the lynxes." Galileo did
not reply. He continued to work on De motu and to tend his garden and his
family.
Placing Virginia and Livia with the Poor Clares of San Matteo in Arcetri
did not relieve Galileo of responsibility for their care. They called upon
him frequently for protection against the hunger and cold that stalked their
"prison," as Maria Celeste called their refuge, usually for themselves but also
for other nuns on the edge of starvation or bankruptcy." Galileo always met
these requests, which directed his charity toward the monastic life that had
attracted him as a boy. During the 1620S and early 1630S, for which Maria
Celeste's moving letters to her father are extant, the plight of his daughters
kept the dark and light of Catholic experience constantly before his eyes.
Maria Celeste stoically describes her cold and hunger, and her distressingly
frequent illnesses, the loss of all her teeth, her misery in "this wretched
world"; and joyfully expresses her satisfaction in serving Galileo and the con­
vent in small things, and in contemplating "the reward that awaits us, after
the brevity and darkness of the winter of the present life, when at last we will
enter the clarity and happiness of the eternal spring of Heaven.""
Meanwhile there was this life and its winters to get through. One nun
tried to shorten her sufferings. Maria Celeste was there to tend and comfort
the failed suicide. Sister Arcangela suffered severe depression. Maria Celeste
asked Galileo for special food and wine for her, and, because she "often finds
interaction with others unbearable," moved out of the tiny cell they shared
"in order to be able to live in the kind of peace and unity befitting the intense

266
GALILEO
love we bear each other." This left Maria Celeste on the charity of another nun
with more space until one of the best rooms in the convent became available.
Galileo gave the considerable sum required to buy it." Maria Celeste dealt
with infirmities of the body as well as of the soul. She ran the convent drug
store, made potions, and gave medical advice. Galileo received both pills and
counsel. Her refrain: work less in the garden, especially on cold spring days,
and drink less wine on all days." She sugarcoated this advice with candied
fruits, of which Galileo was particularly fond. So poor, however, was she
that often she asked for the fruit and the sugar, and for plates and vessels to
transport them and the cordials she prepared in her laboratory."
During these years-he was now in his sixties-Galileo did not live in Flor­
ence but in the hills south of the Arno at Bellosguardo, about an hour's ride by
mule from Maria Celeste's convent of San Matteo. He devoted much of his time
to cultivating his garden, fruit trees, and vineyard, and looking after his chick­
ens, nephews, and grandchildren." His brother Michelangelo came to visit
in 1627. It was not a happy time. Galileo was ill and crotchety. Michelangelo's
wife Chiara also was ill. Trying to preserve some independence, Michelangelo
declined Galileo's offer to establish him in Florence and returned to Munich,
leaving Chiara and their younger children with Galileo. Two daughters went
back with Michelangelo. One of them, Mechilde, was so pretty and promis­
ing that the convent in which she studied Latin had waived her fees." That
helped. Michelangelo was always in need of money to feed, house, clothe, and
educate his family, and to keep himself in the wine he regarded as a necessity.
The brothers had something more than the lute in common.
What would happen to Michelangelo's needy young family if their ultimate
support died of his frequent ailments? Michelangelo allowed himself to raise
the question. "If you were to die (God forbid) without having arranged your
affairs ... the misery of my situation would be inexpressible." Galileo did not
like this reminder of his mortality. Michelangelo had to apologize. "I am very
weak-minded, as you know." But he was not too weak to remove Mechilde
from her convent when he discovered that the nuns had little Latin to teach
but many ways to exploit girls on fee waivers, or to call his family back to
Munich when Galileo complained that his young nieces and nephews dis­
turbed his philosophical repose. Their Bavarian reunion did not last long.
Poor, overburdened, overshadowed, weak-minded Michelangelo died in Jan­
uary 1630. Chiara and the children lived precariously on a pension provided
by the Duke of Bavaria and, probably, on help from Galileo."

VAINGLORY
Calileo's son Vincenzo married in 1629 and soon had a son who stayed with
Galileo while Vincenzo withdrew to avoid the plague then menacing Florence."
For once a Galilei married well. Vincenzo's wife, Sestilia, had been educated
properly in a convent. Her brother, Geri Bocchineri, a secretary to Ferdinando II,
an open and generous man, became a good friend to Galileo as well as to Vin­
cenzo. When Vincenzo returned to Florence, he was able to purchase a house
adjacent to the small one he already owned with financial help from Bocchineri
and Galileo. This improved accommodation, in the Costa San Giorgio upriver
from the Pitti palace, lay on the road to the village of Arcetri, where Galileo
moved in the summer of 1631 at the urging ofVincenzo and Maria Celeste." The
family thus reassembled could eat together provided Galileo brought the food to
the nuns' guests' dining table."
Galileo confided in Maria Celeste some of the hopes he pinned on Rome.
She energized her sisters to work for their fulfillment in the only way they
could. "We shall not fail to pray the Lord ... to bless you by letting you
achieve all that you desire, so long as [she knew her father] that be for the
best." The nuns hoped for something in return, for alms and the man, for
a small income and a proper confessor. Their current spiritual guide was
"more suited to hunting rabbits than guiding souls." Poverty enticed danger.
Priests unpaid for their services tended to recoup in kind, by coming unin­
vited to dinner and becoming overfamiliar with the flightier nuns. Galileo
seems to have succeeded in replacing the confessor but not in augmenting
the alms."
Galileo's contributions to the economy of San Matteo-food from his
garden, wine from his cellar, delicacies as required, wool and linen for
clothes and bedding, allowances and pocket money on request, larger sums
when needed (Maria Celeste's cell, Arcangela's overdraft for food for the
convent), an occasional loan to a needy nun-did not cause him to stint on
himself. 65 However, this outlay plus expenses for the rest of his family and
for the upkeep of Bellosguardo or Arcetri with its two servants probably left
him with little extra. He did not live extravagantly. He sold the produce of
his garden and vineyard when the yield exceeded his needs." Maria Celeste
thought him very generous. "We are overwhelmingly committed to you, not
only as daughters, but as the abandoned orphans we would be, Sire, if not for
you." "I ... confess myself indebted for an almost infinite multitude of bless­
ings conferred by yoU."67 She felt that she could ask him for any small gift or
service: relics from Rome, cloth for cuffs, music for a defective organ, repair

of the convent clock, though that was work "more suited to a carpenter than
to a philosophet''"
Dangerous dialogues
Despite the prolonged visits of his family, Galileo was relatively free from
illness, or unusually quiet about it, during the later 1620S. He complained
to Maria Celeste about his usual spring ailments in 1627 and 1628, and occa­
sional short indispositions, but they abated enough that he could complete
his treatise On the tides in good time when he returned vigorously to it in
September 1629.69 When in good form he made do with fewer than seven
hours of sleep a day. Exploiting this capacity and earlier texts like the letter to
Ingoli, Galileo swiftly created three "days" of philosophical comedy to pref­
ace the already written fourth day's dialogue on the tides." Day 1 demolishes
Aristotelian physics; Day 2, arguments against the diurnal motion; and Day
3, arguments against the annual motion.
Day 1 of Destruction takes on Aristotle's distinction between the ungener­
able and incorruptible heavenly bodies, rotating in their spherical perfec­
tion around the center of the universe, and the sublunar elements and their
combinations, perpetually exposed to the likelihood of transforming into
their opposites. Salviati approaches the distinction as Aristotle did in De caelo
by inquiring why the world has three and only three dimensions. Simplicio
replies that three is complete, perfect, etc., and that there are exactly three
natural motions, toward, away from, and around the center. Salviati prefers
the experimental route. Harking back to a Ptolemaic argument that Galileo
could have learned from his teacher Buonamici, Salviati declares that, since
no more than three mutually perpendicular lines can be made to intersect
at a point, there can be no more than three dimensions. The business has
nothing to do with three natural motions. Indeed, there is but one such if by
natural motion we mean one that can go on forever. Motion toward or away
from the center occurs only briefly in order to convey out-of-place mate­
rial to its proper distance from the center. Rocks can enjoy perpetuity of
motion as well as planets; for a rock is indifferent to motion by which it
neither approaches nor recedes from the earth, that is, a motion that seems
horizontal locally but in fact is an arc of a circle concentric with the earth. To

VAINGLORY
prove which Salviati tantalizes his friends with a glimpse of Galileo's theory
of descent along inclined planes."
Simplicio objects that, as his Aristotelian texts taught, the natural motions
toward, away from, and around the center of the universe are manifest to the
senses. Poor Simplicio! He has fallen for a petitio principii: it is just the exist­
ence of this center that is in question. Perhaps the universe has none. "If any
center may be assigned to the universe," however, says Salviati, more boldly
than Bellarmine would have liked, "we shall find the sun to be placed there."
Then the motions up and down, sursum et deorsum, can refer only to the earth's
center and can scarcely ground a universe. It is the same with the moon; out­
of-order lunar rocks fall to the lunar center, and similarly with other planets.
There is but one natural motion and no quintessence. Simplicio: Negantes
principia non disputandum est! What? Yes, you cannot argue with imbeciles who
reject the principles underlying the disputation. There are no such things as
moon rocks or planetary parts. Those bodies are incorruptible, unbreakable,
and perfectly spherical, encased in a firmament harder than adamant." That,
anyway, is what Galileo made Simplicio believe, although by then most peri­
patetics had replaced the hard spheres, which were the work of Arabic com­
mentators on Aristotle, with the softer heavens of Tycho Brahe."
The discussion had not advanced. Sagredo thought he knew why. Like
most philosophers, Simplicio feared freedom. "Who would there be to settle
our controversies if Aristotle were to be deposed? What other author should
we follow in the schools, the academies, the universities?" Abhorrence of
a philosophical vacuum no doubt is an important force in the world. "It is
wrong [said Aristotle, rightly] to remove the foundations of a science unless
you can replace them with others more convincing." Replying 2,000 years
later, Sagredo likened stubborn peripatetics to fine gentlemen who, having
invested heavily in their palaces, in pictures, mosaics, marbles, murals, refuse
to admit that the entire structure needed replacement, but try to shore it
up with jerry-built expedients, chains, props, and wedges. To which Salviati
added that to introduce a new philosophy, a reformer had to do much more
than refute one philosopher or another. "It is necessary first to teach the
reform of the human mind and to render it capable of distinguishing truth
from falsehood, which only God [and his prophets] can do.'?"
Salviati and Sagredo attack in the obvious way. What do you say, Sim­
plicio, about novas, comets, sunspots, moon mountains? Simplicio appeals
to delle Colombe's crystal moon and Scheiner's solar starlets, theories then

270
GALILEO
widely discredited and, in Scheiner's case, discarded by its inventor. Anyone
who does not see that the mountains and the spots lie on the surfaces of the
luminaries suffers from "the rankest ignorance of perspective,'?" Salviati and
Sagredo endeavor to teach Simplicio the true reason for the secondary light of
the moon, but it is difficult going because he keeps relapsing into incorrupt­
ibility and cannot bring himself to assimilate the moon to the earth." They
all reject the possibility of human life on the moon, a dangerous concept that
Galileo had always repudiated." This unusual concord breaks to allow the
gratuitous annihilation of Scheiner for referring moonglow to sunlight dif­
fusing through the lunar body and for plagiarism, deceit, and stupidity."
There were other familiar dragons to slay, too, delle Colombes, Chiara­
montis, and their like, who degraded the human mind by enslaving it to the
authority of old Greeks who lacked telescopes." To be sure, Salviati concedes,
we cannot know God's creation extensively, in all its details; but (replying
to Barberini?) "with regard to those few [things] which the human intellect
does understand, I believe that its knowledge equals the Divine in objective
certainty, for here it succeeds in understanding necessity." Simplicio: "This
speech strikes me as very bold and daring." And so it was. Sagredo: Let's go
for a ride in a gondola. "Tomorrow I shall expect you both so that we may
continue the discussions now begun."?
Day 2. They reassembled to hear Salviati present physical demonstrations of
the earth's diurnal rotation and destroy arguments opposing it. He turned
out to be too persuasive for his own good. As he admitted, he enjoyed show­
ing off and often had to run for cover. "[I] am impartial ... and masquerade
as Copernicus only as an actor in these plays of ours." "Be guided not by
what I say when we are in the heat of acting out our play, but after I have put
off the costume, for perhaps then you shall find me different from what you
saw of me on stage." "It should be almost as if we had met to tell stories.'?"
Under this armor Salviati and Sagredo blaspheme freely against peripatetics.
"Oh, the inexpressible baseness of abject minds," Sagredo sighs; "[nothing]
more revolting," echoes Salviati. 82 Having thus aroused the goodwill of his
adversaries, Salviati advances the main arguments pro-spin: it is more eco­
nomical for the earth to revolve than the entire starry firmament, especially
a firmament as solid as steel; and also more symmetrical, since if the earth
revolves and the heavens stand, celestial rotations fall into order, growing
progressively slower from Mercury to the stars."

VAINGLORY
Simplicia brings up the heavy artillery of common sense. If the earth
spun, birds and clouds would fall behind. Salviati replies that all objects in or
near the earth participate in its rotation. A motion common to all is as good
as nonexistent. Not so, cries Simplicio: has not Aristotle said, and count­
less peripatetics after him, that a weight dropped from the mast of a ship in
motion would fall astern and even to sea? Not so, rejoins Salviati, claiming to
have performed many times on this tiresome floating laboratory. Had he, or
rather Galileo, in fact done the experiment in question? Almost. On his way
to Rome in 1624, Galileo had enjoyed a boat ride with Cesi and Stellutti on a
lake near Cesi's villa. The discussion turned to Aristotle's claim. Galileo asked
for something heavy. Stellutti offered his keys. Galileo threw them vertically
upward. Would they return to the hand that sped them or fall into the lake?
Salviati amplified this quasi test with the thought experiment about the birds,
balls, and fish that Galileo had set out for Ingoli."
Meanwhile Sagredo was pondering the consequence that, since the
common motion has no effect on the behavior of the bodies that share it, the
weight from the mast must fall to the deck in the same time however great
the speed of the boat. What would the fall look like to an observer on the
shore? In a beautiful insight, Sagredo saw that the released weight is to the sta­
tionary observer what a cannon ball fired point blank is to the artilleryman,
the horizontal velocity imparted by the gun being analogous to the common
motion of the boat and all things on it. From the analogy it followed that
cannon balls shot horizontally over level ground hit the ground at the same
time irrespective of their range. "[That] seems a marvelous thing." Salviati:
"This reflection is very beautiful by reason of its novelty ... I have no doubt
about its correctness.?" There is no need for experiment in a well-constructed
natural philosophy.
Unwilling to be outdone, Salviati disclosed two beautiful reflections that
temporarily silenced Sagredo: "I cannot find words to express the admira­
tion they cause in me." The first considers the trajectory in space of a rock
dropped from a tower on the supposition that it can attain the earth's center.
Assume that it gets there along a semicircle that keeps it always in touch with
the tower AD (Figure 7.1) until it hits the ground at F. In a time t the earth
turns through an angle a = rot and the stone falls a distance BX. Since LA YX
� zu, the rock's speed along the tangent at X, vX' is to its speed before release
at A, VA' as zœt . YX is to rot . AO. But XY = AY = AO!2. So vx: VA = 1. In falling,
the rock moves from one circle to another without changing speed and, if

o
allowed to do so, would reach the earth's center in six hours independent of
the height of the tower. Hence, as Salviati argued �n Day 1, separated rocks
return to the earth along circular paths, conserving their tangential velocity
and allowing Galileo, as was his custom, to avoid bringing causes or forces
into play.
This first reflection is the bizzarria or oddity mentioned earlier as a playful
marvel in Galileo's philosophical comedy. If taken seriously, it results in a
velocity of free fall proportional to the time elapsed, as in Galileo's rule, but
far off quantitatively." Salviati professed a great interest in obtaining a value
of the constant of acceleration in free fall, a "problem," he said, previously
unknown to "any philosopher or mathematician whatsoever." To solve it,
Salviati gave another glimpse at Galileo's theory of motion-the spaces tra­
versed in equal intervals of time are as the odd numbers beginning with one.
Sagredo: "This is a remarkable thing ... Is there a mathematical proof?" Salvi­
ati: "Most purely mathematical," one of many such in the science "our friend"
has founded in place of a thousand worthless volumes. "Not a single one of
the infinite admirable conclusions within this science had been observed and
understood by anyone before [him]." After many experiments, Galileo had
decided that a falling body covers 100 yards in five seconds."
The second reflection, another extraordinary piece of kinematics, is even
less plausible than the first. Ptolemy had argued that objects not fastened to
the earth would be thrown off if the globe spun. Galileo countered that irre­
spective of the speed of rotation, no such extrusion can occur. The argument

VAINGLORY
273
invokes a theorem of Euclid's: the tangent (HG in Figure 7.2) is a mean pro­
portional between the secant FG and its external part GE, that is, GE:HG =
HG:FG. Suppose that in a unit of time the rock would reach G if it did not
fall towards E; and let the entire fall occur from G as if the tangential veloc­
ity v vanished there. Suppose further that t and therefore the angle a are
very small; FG then approaches the constant value 2a and HG2 � 2aGE. Thus,
since GE goes to zero much faster than HG no matter how large v is, for suf­
ficiently short times GE can always be small enough that the rock can regain
the earth or, better, never leave it. "Take note, Simplicio, just how far one may
go without geometry and philosophize well about gravity." Or, rather, just
how absurd a conclusion the theoretical physicist (filosofo geometra) can reach
by subliming to mathematics. Salviati tacitly takes HG, which measures the
velocity of extrusion in time t, as related to GE, the distance fallen toward
earth in the same time. But GE is determined by g, the acceleration under
gravity, HG by the velocity of rotation, two entirely independent quantities.
The velocity v can be as large as required but g cannot be changed. The usu­
ally shrewd Sagredo allowed himself to be hoodwinked. "The argument is
truly very subtle, but nonetheless convincing, and it must be admitted that
trying to deal with physical problems without geometry is attempting the
irnpossible.?"
Calileo's striking error here combines three typical misconceptions. First,
he could not think himself away from the earth anymore than Simplicio could
imagine himself on a planet. Consequently, just as he conceived the "horizon­
tal" on which a ball rests or moves indifferently to be a spherical shell con­
centric with the earth, so he tied the velocity of extrusion functionally to the
H

an unattached body cannot be

matter how fast the earth spins.

earth's gravity. Second, he swindled himself again by confusing space and
time, as appears from Figure 7.3, where HI, I],]K represent equal intervals of
time and IL, ]M, KN the velocities gained under gravity. He then interpreted the
diagram as it appears to be, a drawing of spatial relationships, taking IX, ]Y ...
as the equivalent of the subtangent GE in Figure 7.2 and HI, H] ... as the associ­
ated tangent HG. Since the subtangent goes to zero faster than the tangent, no
extrusion can occur," Third, he overreached. He needed only to demonstrate,
against Ptolemy and Tycho, that extrusion can be prevented by gravity, not
that, irrespective of the magnitude of the spin, it can never occur at all. The
idiosyncrasy of Galileo's black-and-white approach appears when comparing
his treatment of extrusion with Sarpi's. Fra Paolo understood that two inde­
pendent quantities were at play, the velocity of spin and the acceleration under
gravity, and that extrusion does not occur for us because on earth the latter
overcomes the former. If, however, the velocity of rotation increased indefi­
nitely while the gravity remained the same, eventually we would be thrown off
our earth like so much mud from a wagon wheel."
When not talking philosophy or praising one another, Salviati and Sagredo
treat Simplicio as the dolt in a Socratic dialogue, drawing from him the dem­
onstrations they put in him, patronizing him when he succeeds ("[you] have
shown yourself half a geometer") and insulting him when he fails ("if you
had paid attention ... you would not have thought up such a silly idea")." The
poor man is hopelessly ill-equipped. "If Aristotle is to be abandoned ... Sup­
pose you name some other author?" An excellent question: without texts

where does the investigator begin? Salviati has no answer. Instead he offers
a false dichotomy. "It is impossible that one of two contradictory propo­
sitions should not be true and the other false." Simplicio-he is simple­
acquiesces." Now, when Salviati proves that Ptolemy and Aristotle are
wrong, and opposed to heliocentrism, it will follow that Copernicus must
be right.
The second day concludes repetitiously by responding to three anti­
Copernicans whose arguments Simplicio reads out one by one. These old
sinners are Chiaramonti, Scheiner, and Scheiner's student Johann Georg
Locher. Scheiner and Locher had remarked that if stones falling onto the
earth from the sphere of the moon also participate in the earth's hypotheti­
cal spin they must execute spirals of varying complexity depending on their
angular distance from the equator. The same thing must be true of birds. In
order to stay suspended over their nests or to swoop down on their prey,

they must perform acrobatics of staggering intricacy. An imposing drawing,
on which Sagredo and Salviati exercise their sarcasm, depicts everyday space
traffic-birds, balls, and a snail (bird food?) going down, rockets, fireworks,
cannon shots going up (Figure 7.4), all improbably managing apparently
vertical motion by intricate unseen dances. How do they do it? Is the prin­
ciple intrinsic or extrinsic, natural or violent, compound or simple, angelic
or aerial, accidental or substantial? In every case neither prong of the dichot-
0my will do if the earth turns."
Here is another conundrum, aimed at Copernicus' teaching that sepa­
rated parts of the earth return not to the center of the universe but to the
great body of rocky matter. Would a stone at the center of a spherical cavity
concentric with the earth rise to the shell or stay put? Salviati: the cavity
would collapse. Again, according to Scheiner and Locher, the earth is far too
small for the tasks that Copernicus imposed on it. For in a year it would roll
out only 365 times its circumference. But the suppositious annual circuit is
1,200 times the earth's circumference. Copernicus requires almost four years
where one is seen to do. Simplicio likes the argument. What do you think of
that? Not much, says Sagredo, and threatens to go off in a gondola."
It is Chiaramonti's turn. He holds that Copernican theory would ruin phi­
losophy. All philosophers agree that knowledge begins with sense impres­
sions. Copernicans deny the testimony of their senses. If we follow them, "we
must necessarily suspect our own senses as wholly fallible or stupid ... Then
what truth can we hope for?" None, to be sure. Unfortunately for him, Chi­
aramonti descends from this secure position to disallow compound motion.
Wherefore? Because nature gives joints to bodies that have to perform more
than one motion simultaneously and the earth has no joints. Simplicio, who
has been reading out this nonsense, thinks it ingenious. Salviati: "Are you seri­
ous?" Simplicio: "I am giving you the very best that is in me." After disposing
of a jointed earth, Salviati points out so many trivial errors of Chiaramonti
about the Copernican system that even Simplicio blushes for his author."
Jointless or not, Salviati protests, everybody picks on the earth. It may be
dark, but so are the planets. Earth is no more the sink of corruption than the
moon or Jupiter. And if it were the muck pile of the universe, why should it be
placed at the center? Sagredo: that would be like placing the lazarhouse in the
middle of the city. Salviati: "Sagredo, you are too caustic and sarcastic."?
Sagredo calls it quits for the day. There would be no gondola ride. Sim­
plicio had to study Scheiner's arguments against the annual motion, Salviati

Chiaramonti's against the parallaxes of novas. As we know, Sagredo had
other ways to amuse himself at night. "Tomorrow we shall take up the dis­
course again ... hoping to hear great new things."?'
Day 3. While awaiting the arrival of Simplicio, Salviati and Sagredo amuse
themselves at the expense of philosophers who dishonor the human race by
slavishly following some author. "Their company may be not only unpleasant
but dangerous." They except Simplicio from the condemnation "as a man of
great ingenuity and entirely without malice." A pity he knows no geometry.
Lo! The man without malice or geometry enters, out of breath, having been
detained in a narrow canal where his gondola ran aground. He had used
the time productively by watching the tide ebb and flow, the tiny residual
trickles turning into rivulets without an instant of rest between fall and rise.
Salviati undertakes to explain the effect until reminded of his assignment
to report on Chiaramonti's arguments against the parallactic measurements
that placed the novas in the heavens."
Chiaramonti's main argument, a continuation of his Antitycho (1621),
turned on comparing the locations of the nova of 1572 as determined by a
dozen observers in different places and presented and analyzed by Tycho.
Taking the observations in pairs and calculating the implied parallaxes,
Chiaramonti found that some pairs put the nova under the moon, others
among the fixed stars, and still others beyond the firmament. There is no
truth in mathematics! To bring the matter to Simplicio's level, Salviati drew
Figure 7.5, in which ABE is the earth centered at D, A and B are the two
observers stationed, for ease of representation, on the same meridian of
longitude, DE is the intersection of the equator with the plane of the paper.
The observers measure the zenith distances a and ß of the star S. The
angular distance À between their stations as seen from D is the measurable
difference in their latitudes; and so the parallax angle, LASB = y, may be
determined. The method is simple: the sum of the angles in the quadrilat­
eral OBSA must be 360°; two of the angles are the supplements of a and
ß; hence y = (a + ß) - À. If S is very far away, observers at A and B see it in
the same direction, y � 0, and a + ß = À. If À > (a + ß), S has no place, or is
beyond the firmament; if y > Yo' the lunar parallax, S is below the moon. I
know all that, says Simplicio, as I've read in Aristotle that the sum of the
angles in a triangle is two right angles. Thank the Lord, Salviati replies, in
his annoying condescending way. "I was worried about not being able to

explain it in such a way that a pure philosopher and Peripatetic would get
a firm grip on it."99
Now the work begins, computing the distance to S in terrestrial radii
from the known angles and the law of sines. The computations, which baf­
fled Simplicio, will be obvious to trigonometers and of no interest to anyone
else. Salviati exhibits them in detail, making many computational errors in
the process. He premises that all the observations erred to some extent. The
job of the astronomer is not to select the pairs that put the star wherever he
wants but to calculate whether with minimal corrections most of the obser­
vations can be brought into agreement. Salviati's shrewd and commonsensi­
cal discussion concerns the manipulation of data rather than an analysis of
instrumental error. It comes to this: five of ten measurements place the nova
beyond the moon, and another five do so also with a total correction of 1O�
minutes of arc; to obtain ten measurements that place it halfway between
the earth and the moon required repairs totaling 756 minutes. Simplicio:
"the ineffectiveness of this author's proofs thus seems to me to have been
very clearly exposed."lOO However, they occupy only a small part of Chiara­
rnonti's big book. Perhaps his other proofs are better? They must be worse,

VAINGLORY
279
Salviati assures Simplicio, though he has not read them, since they suppose
observations more difficult than those already discussed. In contrast, other
observations-that the nova never changed its distance from any fixed star
and that every observer found its zenith distances at upper and lower con­
tinuation to be equal-confirm the true picture.'?'
Returning to Socratic mode, Salviati directs Simplicio to draw the posi­
tions of the luminaries and the planets. Put the earth and the sun wherever
you want. Now, where do the planets go? Simplicio dutifully puts the infe­
rior planets around the sun because of their limited elongation and Venus'
phases. And where does Mars go? Evidently around the earth, since we can
see it at any angular distance from the sun; and also around the sun, since
it does not run into or occult Venus. Jupiter and Saturn have similar orbits
enclosing that of Mars. Well done! "So far you have comported yourself
uncommonly well." And now comes the moment of truth. Which is at rest
in the suppositions center, the earth or the sun?':" While Simplicio hesi­
tates to embrace Salviati's view, his cleverer friends go back to philosopher­
bashing. Sagredo: why have people not admitted the Pythagorean scheme
that Simplicio almost drew spontaneously? Salviati: it is better to wonder
how this world of fools and idiots can have generated a few minds so supe­
rior that "through the sheer force of intellect [they have] done such violence
to their own senses as to prefer what reason told them over what sensible
experience plainly showed them." Only "superhuman souls" can perform
such feats.'?'
Simplicio admits to being one of those simpletons who cannot under­
stand how a heavy body like the earth can run around in space. The wise
men ignore the implied question. Instead Salviati tells Simplicio about the
telescope, "[which] it has pleased God to concede to human ingenuity." This
instrument has resolved puzzles that perplexed even Copernicus. It shows
the correct sizes of celestial objects by stripping them of their irradiation,
provides the missing phases of Venus, and annuls earth's uniqueness in pos­
sessing a moon. Still, no one needs a telescope to persuade himself of the
sun's rest and the earth's motion. A naked eye connected to an unprejudiced
mind can infer the truth from the retrogradations of the superior planets.
What Salviati had in mind appears from Figure 7.6. From time to time a
superior planet slows in its easterly motion, stops, moves backwards ("ret­
rogrades") to the west, stops again, and resumes its easterly journey; in mid­
retrogradation, the planet, being in opposition to the sun and closest to the

earth, is at its brightest.'?" Everything falls into place if the earth occupies
the third heaven.
Salviati proceeds to a second argument for the annual motion, a new one,
unprecedented, based on the motion of sunspots, and discovered, like "all
other novelties in the sky," by Galileo. In a passage of sustained bluff and
deceit, Salviati steals Scheiner's observations of the trajectories of the spots
and the solar theory based on them and makes both serve the Copernican
cosmology. With the help of a network of Jesuit observers, Scheiner had

VAINGLORY
found that the trajectories curved upwards for half the year and downward
for the other half and appeared straight only at the transition. He remarked
that if the axis around which the spots turned inclined toward the ecliptic,
observation would agree with theory; and, after many careful measurements,
he determined the inclination to be 7° or l30', a very good approximation
to the modern value (7°15'). Scheiner worried that Galileo would learn about
it before his long-winded masterpiece Rosa ursina appeared, and he asked his
correspondents to maintain it in confidence lest the Censor (as he called the
Assayer of Jesuit astronomy) steal it.105 And so he did, although Rosa was
published two years before the Dialogue.106
On Day 2, Salviati had made the solar axis perpendicular to the ecliptic and
the spot trajectories parallel to it, as in Calileo's Letters on sunspots (1613). On Day
3, after claiming the discovery of the spots for Galileo and dismissing Apelles as
"vain and foolish," Salviati admitted that the trajectories curve, and that he had
known it all along. In proof whereof he told the following cock-and-bull story.
One day, when staying with Salviati at Le Selve, Galileo saw a fat spot traversing
a conspicuously curved path. He grasped at once that the axis must be tilted.
And if the axis is tilted? "Filippo," quoth Galileo, "if the axis around which the
sun revolves is not perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic ... then we shall
have a more solid and convincing theory of the sun and earth than has ever yet
been offered by anybody.'?"
Galileo needed such a story because, even before laying eyes on Rosa, he
was trumpeting that it could contain nothing new. "I am sure that if he says
anything different from what I said in my Letters on Sunspots, it will all be vanity
and lies." That was to dig himself into a hole from which he could only lie his
way out. He was encouraged by Castelli, who had sniffed the Rosa and found
it "stinking." Together with other delicate Galileists, Castelli suggested that
someone complain to the Jesuit General about the nausea the work caused
thern.!" What would be the charge? Enticing Galileo to trample the truth?
Using a Keplerian rather than a Galileian telescope? Publishing a book so
lavish in layout, so full of excellent plates, so prolific with depictions of instru­
ments, that Galileo could never hope to equal it?109 Scheiner complained that
Galileo had laid "violent hands" on his life's work. That was not to do violence
to human rights. To Galileo Scheiner was an animal, a pig, an ass."?
Returning to the sublime, Salviati explained that if the sun stands in the
center with its direction of spin fixed in space (Figure 7.7), everything observed
takes place without special additional hypotheses. Straight trajectories do

FIG.7.7 Sunspot trajectories. Let the spot lie on the solar equator ABCD, which
meets the plane of the ecliptic at Band D. Seen from El (El B is perpendicular to
the plane of the paper), the spot moves along the straight line AC; seen from E2'

occur, but only when the line of sight from the moving observer falls perpen­
dicularly on the solar axis. Simplicio brought himself to ask why the same
phenomenon would not follow if the sun moved. Salviati replied that the sun
then would have to move simultaneously in three distinct ways: once a year
around the earth and once a month around its axis; and, while this is going
on, the axis would have to revolve around the perpendicular to the ecliptic.
Scheiner had introduced this third motion to keep the axis of the moving
sun pointing continually in the same direction. He borrowed the device from
Copernicus, who had ascribed such a revolution to the earth's axis of spin to
keep it always parallel to itself. On the assumption that the annual revolution
takes place as if the earth rotated like a weight on a stick (Figure 7.8), an axis
EA fixed in it would be carried from El Al to E2A3 during half a year; to keep
it parallel to itself, to bring it to E2A2' it would have to rotate 1800 around
the moving perpendicular to the ecliptic EB, keeping the angle of inclination
BEA constant. As appears from consideration of a quarter turn, Copernicus'

third rotation has the additional awkwardness of opposing the sense of the
annual revolution.'!'
If the sun rested at the center it would not require the retrogression of
the axis to save the phenomena of the sunspots. That was enough to ravish
Sagredo. "I have not, among the many profundities I have ever heard, met
with anything which is more wonderful to my intellect or has more deci­
sively captured my mind ... than these two conjectures, one of which is taken
from the stopping and retrograde motion of the five planets, and the other
from the peculiarities of movement of the sunspots." Salviati met this enthu­
siasm with dissimulation: he has been giving the best arguments he can,
leaving the decision to others. The decision came down to a binary choice,
Salviati went on, with another of his preposterous paralogisms, "since one of
the arrangements must be true and the other false."!" Simplicio must have
looked surprised at this violation of sound logic since Salviati returned to
the question whether the Copernican system gave the simpler explanation
of the motions of the spots. If the earth has three motions, why not the sun?
The answer gave another glimpse at Calileo's kinematics. There is no need
for the third Copernican motion, Salviati said; the earth will naturally con­
serve its direction of spin. In its annual motion it does not revolve like a
rock in a sling but like a float in a tub of water turning around a vertical axis
through its center. As the tub revolves clockwise, the float, say a wooden
disk, appears to rotate counterclockwise so that a needle lying on it always
points in the same direction. That is the way things are. "Any suspended and
balanced body you please [will behave that way], and without requiring any

GALILEO
cause of motion."ll3 Here Galileo's kinematic intuition led him to a useful
result, and also a correct one, since the conservation of angular momentum,
a principle unknown to him, annuls Copernicus' third motion.
But-to return to Simplicio's question-would the argument not also
apply to a moving sun? If it did, the claim that the Copernican theory
afforded a simpler explanation of spot trajectories would fail. Salviati held
his ground, muddily, by asserting that a third motion would be necessary if
the sun did not rest. In this he was right, since if, during its diurnal revolution
around the earth, its axis maintained the same orientation in space, the spots
would appear to spin around it in a day. This consequence jumps out from
Figure 7.9, where OQ is perpendicular to the ecliptic, OP is the sun's axis of
spin, and X is a sunspot as seen on the sun's disk by an observer on earth. Let
ETO be perpendicular to SOU at sunrise: X will appear on the sun's eastern
limb. At midday, the line of sight EO passes through S; the great circle QUS
and therefore X lie in the plane of the meridian, and X appears to have traveled
halfway across the disk. At nightfall, EO passes through V and X appears on
the sun's western limb. To correct for this effect the sun would require a ret­
rogression similar to Copernicus' third motion. The argument is not decisive
but does have an appeal to non-Simplicios who like simplicity,'!'
In partial extenuation of the Dialogue's putdowns of peripatetics and mag­
nifications of Galileo, it may be placed in the genre of epideictic rhetoric, a

favorite Renaissance style of praise-and-blame. Often the cardboard char­
acters in these exercises wore masks to give them greater leeway in throw­
ing bouquets and brickbats. Calileo's mastery of the style extended to the
postils, or marginal notes, in the Dialogue. They introduce another unseen
party, another voice in the praising and blaming. The postil writer is pungent
and pithy: "a philosopher's ridiculous answer"; "very puerile conclusions";
"paralogism of this peripatetic." Another standard ingredient in epideictic
rhetoric was the sort of inversion in which Galileo excelled: "you are not
only wrong, sir, but the truth is the exact opposite of what you say."!" If
Galileo consciously adopted this rhetorical mode in the expectation that his
victims would grin and bear it, he was mistaken.
7.3 THE WINDMILL
Urban's mood swings made maneuvering at his court unusually hazardous. He
could drop highly placed officials without a moment's notice. Ciampoli thus
fell in 1632 after a decade's service as secretary, special agent, and cntertainer.t"
He nursed his wounds in a bitter diagnosis of life at Urban's court in the form
of advice to a would-be courtier. Here is a summary. Seek patronage among
functionaries and chamberlains, for they, and not the court cardinals, have the
power; but do not aim too high. Confide in no one; believe in no one; do not
meet with other courtiers in your room, lest someone spread rumors of a plot.
Avoid ostentation; do not talk about the prince or about court scandal, do not
talk cleverly, try not to talk at all. Never criticize priests or monks publicly,
show no preference for any religious order; appear to be religious, pious, and
zealous, for hypocrites do well; "truth in all courts, and especially in Rome, is
a great impediment to advancement." Are you spied on? Honor the spy; "simu­
lation is the life of the court." Do you want to destroy a rival? Expose his love of
women or money. But watch out for the sharpers, bad mouthers, and double
dealers who would do the same to you. Then, if you serve your patron as if he
were a god, keep your mouth closed and ears open, avoid appearing clever, and
remember that patience is to the courtier what chastity, poverty, and obedi­
ence are to the monk, you might do well before you fal1.117
Fall was inevitable, if only because the next pope would replace his pred­
ecessor's clients and creatures with his own. Meanwhile the courtier around

an all-male society, square profane art with sacred scripture, escape tram­
pling in the scuffles among the religious orders, avoid damaging political
allegiances, and curry favor with cardinals likely to be pope.!" Needless to
say, the person most exposed to the plots and vagaries of the Vatican and the
external events that drove them was His Urbanity, the Pontiff himself.
Dominicans
A world-class acrobat among high-wire courtiers was Galileo's acquaintance
and would-be correspondent Tommaso Campanella. During his 27 years
of confinement in Naples before his release in 1626, Campanella had writ­
ten many compromising things, for example, a forecast of an imminent
schism in the papacy and the dissolution of the College of Cardinals, news
he forwarded to Paul V, "because ... I thought Your Beatitude would like to
know,"!" Campanella had obtained this information through "God's benev­
olence" and his own reading of the stars. He had picked up astrology from
della Porta and made the fatal mistake of calculating the success of his plot
against the Spanish government of Naples from his own distinguished nativ­
ity. In prison he had leisure to refine his procedures to the point that, despite
his incarceration as an enemy of the state, distinguished citizens and prel­
ates came to his cell for astrological consultations. He considered Sidereus
nuncius a confirmation of his prediction that a universal restructuring of the
sciences, if not of the Neapolitan regime, was in the offing. He proposed to
reciprocate the discoveries of the starry messenger by prescribing for Gali­
leo's ailments, at a distance, from knowledge of his birth chart. In declining
to furnish it, Galileo expressed reservations about the art. Campanella, who
knew dissimulation like the back of his hand, spied hypocrisy. I know you
believe in astrology, he wrote, from your references to Jupiter in your dedica­
tion of the Starry message to Cosimo. "It would not have been correct to make
use of opinions believed only by common people."!" Campanella's mastery
of astrology would enable him to leapfrog over the other amphibians grop­
ing for Urban's favor.
Campanella's arrival in Rome in 1626 followed that of his Apologia, or
Defense, of Galileo, written in 1616, published in 1622, and banned in 1623-
The occasion of its composition, according to its preface, was a request to
Campanella by Cardinal Caetani for a theological evaluation of Galileo's
Letter to Castelli. It may be that Campanella had completed his Defense before

VAINGLORY
the March decree of the Holy Office banning Copernican works, and there­
fore did not disobey it; but whether the Cardinal solicited the opinion of a
jailbird and, as Campanella claimed, urged him to publish it, may be ques­
tioned.!" In any case, Campanella's ingenious defense of Galileo's position
as more consonant with scripture than the philosophico-theological inter­
discipline that opposed it could not stand in 1623. Campanella had built
on two pillars. The Fathers disagreed about whether earth, sun, or firma­
ment stands or moves; Moses spoke the language of common people and
neglected astronomy; standard theological sources therefore left room for
Galileo's interpretation, indeed, rightly considered, favored it.122 The second
pillar, which Campanella erected with many spiteful grunts, crushed the
authority of Aristotle and the "potbellied theologians who locate the limits
of human genius in [his] writings." Those who hold this opinion were either
crazy, invincibly ignorant, or "embarrassed to become students now that
they are called teachers." In hitching theology to Aristotelian cosmology
these ignoramuses failed to notice that it is both inadequate, as it cannot
even explain the stations and retrogradations of the planets, and impious,
as it teaches the eternity of the world. "[I]t is astonishing how many more
vistas, in which God reveals his wisdom, power, and love, have been discov­
ered by Galileo." Down with Aristotle! Down with his plague of heresies,
his eternal world, his mortal soul, and his frightful God, indifferent to our
prayers and a slave to necessity!'!'
More closely considered, Galileo's astronomical ideas, far from being
heretical, derive from Moses.!" Yes, assuredly. The Copernican theory goes
back to Pythagoras, and Pythagoras was either a Jew or a vehicle for Jewish
thought. That evil genius Aristotle had no time for Moses or Pythagoras. So
Galileo came to rescue "the sacred philosophy of Moses from the insults of
the pagans by using the most discriminating arguments and instruments."!"
Let us therefore be Jews, or, rather, Christians, not Aristotelians, and admit
with Galileo that the moon has mountains and that most philosophers are
fools. Galileo must not be condemned. Foreigners would laugh, theologians
distort, philosophers strut. "[Galileo] has not called on us to do anything
wrong but rather to search for the truth."!"
The Roman Inquisition jailed Campanella in June 1626, a month after the
Neapolitan state had released him. He extricated himself by praising Urban's
poetry. He is greater than Dante, Plato, and Moses; nay, a new David, a new
Orpheus. His poems excel in meat and meter, grammar and philosophy,

288
GALILEO
and, unexpectedly, freedom. (The liberty relates to Aristotelian rules, which
Campanella had urged abandoning many years earlier.!") Proceeding in this
vein, "with demure seriousness and prolix erudition, as if he dealt with a great
masterpiece," Campanella appealed to a vanity inflated "beyond the limits of
good taste and even of modest common sense." Still, he managed to go too
far. Campanella pointed to Urban's sublime verses praising Galileo's astro­
nomical discoveries as harbingers of the new world of humane letters and
religious harmony that Christianity was about to enjoy. The pope's words
already radiated from the center just as the rays of the sun do, "according
to Copernicus." Had not Urban, when only a cardinal, made sure that "the
opinion of great Copernicus, purged of error, could be read hypothetically,
to the advantage of philosophers and the well being of the state">!" The bril­
liant poet pope, "from whose house a new day in the protection, promotion,
and reformation of the divine muses begins to dawn," deserved something
special. Should we not name those unemployed blobs that Galileo had found
around Saturn after him?!"
Urban took the bait. In 1628, after a quick withdrawal of his eccentric
commendation of the pope's Copernican commitments, Campanella
exchanged his cell in the Inquisition's prison for one in the convent of Santa
Maria sopra Minerva. A few months later, in January 1629, he obtained his
freedom.!'" Urban had directed this act of clemency out of fear as well as
vanity. He thought he needed Campanella's expertise to counter the pre­
dictions of the most reliable astrologers money could buy. For months
they had been busy circulating predictions of Urban's imminent death by
comet or eclipse. They had an eager audience in courtiers hoping for prefer­
ment under the next pope and in Spanish and Austrian agents praying for
regime change. During his imprisonment by the Holy Office, Campanella
had received a visit from one hopeful successor to Urban, no less a person
than the Master of the Sacred Palace, the Dominican Niccolo Ridolfi, who
had with him calculations that forecast Urban's death in September 1628.
Campanella found an error in the reckoning but sweetened the news by pre­
dicting Ridolfi's elevation to cardinal in June 1629. That was almost right; in
that month Ridolfi rose to the post of Dominican General. The astrologers,
among whom another Dominican, Raffaelo Visconti, was a leader, refined
their calculations: Urban would die in February 1630 and be succeeded seria­
tim by Dominicans, first Ridolfi and next Father Monster. Either they or the
Angel of Death missed the mark. Urban's brother Carlo, the propagator of

VAINGLORY
the Barberini line, died that February. The calculators postponed the due
date for Maffeo to the summer. Borgia summoned the Spanish cardinals to
Rome, and the French and Germans followed, as if the vacancy they longed
for already existed.131
In the summer of 1628 the pope had summoned Campanella to his rooms
on the Quirinale to work astral magic against the malign effects of eclipses.
Campanella had a theory apt for the occasion. Since, according to a famous
dictum of Saint Thomas, the stars work only on our bodies, a person able
to resist his appetites can thwart them. To which Campanella added, from
bitter experience, that resistance to astral forces was easy for anyone who
had not broken under torture.t " To counter the influence of an eclipse (a
great danger for the son of the sun), it was only necessary to close your­
self in a dark chamber and there recreate the normal state of the heavens,
with lamps representing the planets and luminaries, and incense, aromatic
herbs, and music to indicate the harmonies of the universe. The star-sick
pope and his astral doctor performed these rites together. Urban emerged
more robust than ever. In October 1629, at Castel Gandolfo, he displayed his
strength in a wrestling match with Ciampoli and his good sense in not trying
a fall with the Monster. Campanella dismissed the dire predictions regarding
the summer of 1630 for neglecting the beneficial effects of Mercury.133 He
was right again. Campanella's enemies worried that Urban would make him
a consultor of the Holy Office or even a cardinal.
To clip the wings of the former jailbird, the cardinal nephew and the hope­
ful Dominicans Ridolfi and Riccardi hatched a plot to which Campanella's
manipulations had exposed him. Eager to publish his store of manuscripts,
he had cultivated Ridolfi and Riccardi, both of whom, in sequence, held the
highest censorial post in Rome. Among the items Campanella had in press in
1629 was a treatise on astrology in six books. Around the same time, he gave
Riccardi a copy of a seventh book, "On avoiding the fate of the stars." Ridolfi
and Riccardi decided to publish it. They obtained the manuscript of the first
six books from the printer in France and brought out the lot in Rome, with
a fake imprint and no imprimatur.'>' A disgraceful proceeding for chief cen­
sors! Since the volume had no license and contained the silly prophylaxis
against eclipses that Campanella and Urban had performed at the Quirinale,
and since all Rome knew that the pope had consulted a "Dominican ... who
professes astrology and also necromancy" (so the Venetian ambassador
wrote home), the publication embarrassed Urban.!" He was very angry.

GALILEO
Campanella denied authorship, blamed Ridolfi and Riccardi, and issued the
news that Urban, "as a very wise pope, detested astrology." That saved his
skin but ended his rise.!>
The center for astrological computations in Rome was the Vallombro­
san convent of Santa Prassede, presided over by Galileo's schoolboy friend
Orazio Morandi. The two had remained in contact despite Morandi's service
as astrological advisor to Don Giovanni de' Medici. In May 1630, when in
Rome to try to push the Dialogue through the censorship, Galileo dined with
Morandi in his astrological center. Soon thereafter Urban ordered Morandi's
arrest for presuming to calculate the chances of the cardinals likely to suc­
ceed him.!" The case against Morandi turned on his manuscripts and library.
To protect him, his monks burned the papers and hid the books. Eventu­
ally, however, their location came out and so did the truth. Morandi read
very good books-Aristotle, Plato, the classical poets, the best mathema­
ticians-but also terrible ones, banned books on magic, demonology, and
history, notably the works of Paolo Sarpi. Important people compromised
by entanglement in his circle found his continuing existence inconvenient.
Therefore he died in prison, of fever said the doctor, of poison rumbled
rumor.!" Although Galileo had no part in Morandi's research into the death
order of the high and mighty, or in the circulation of the forecasts of Urban's
death, he took care to clear himself, with Buonarroti's help, of every shred of
suspicion.!" The episode showed Urban that astrology was too dangerous to
be allowed to anyone but himself. In 1631 he issued a bull, Inscrutabilis, against
divination, especially against foretelling the deaths of popes or members of
their families."? The order stigmatized the art as the product of pride and
ambition, and included a statement in harmony with Urban's voluntarism
and unfriendly to cosmologists as well as to astrologers:
The inscrutable profundity of the judgments of God does not allow
the human intellect, confined to the dark prison of the body, to rise
beyond the stars. Yet not only does it dare explore with impious curi­
osity the mysteries buried in the depth of the divine and unknown
even to the saints, it also presumes, with arrogant and dangerous
example, to circulate these mysteries as certainties, with contempt
for God, disturbance of the state, and danger to princes.!"

Jesuits
Among Calileo's sparring partners who turned up in Rome in the 1620S was
Scheiner, who came on business of his college in Neisse and stayed to pub­
lish his masterwork on sunspots. Ignorance of Italian had spared him from
feeling the full sting of the references to him in Galilee's letters to Welser of
1613 and the implication of plagiarism in Guiducci's attack on Grassi. Up to
the wrangle over the comet, Scheiner had regarded Galileo as a comrade in
arms, sometimes rash but often right. In 1615, having swallowed lunar moun­
tains and Galileo's proof of Venus' circumsolar orbit, he defended Galileo's
priority over Mayr in the discovery of Jupiter's satellites. He presented Gali­
leo with several of his books dealing with telescopes, vision, the shape of the
sun, and the flaws of heliocentrism as elaborated by Locher.'? But his efforts
to open a correspondence with "the distinguished and brilliant Italian math­
ematician ... in the hope that from it greater light be shed on the truth" met
with the same silence as his presents and concessions.!"
By the time the distinguished brilliant mathematician deigned to reply, in
the Assayer, Scheiner had learned enough Italian to read Galileo's insults with
full understanding and proportional irritation. He was incensed at the insinua­
tion that he had plagiarized Calileo's work on sunspots ("Apelles ... accused of
infamous thievery!") and aggrieved at Galilee's offhand dismissal of one of his
better discoveries as trivial and mistaken ("[Scheiner] ... exposed to mockery
and childish disdain!")!" He had announced this discovery, that atmospheric
refraction squashes the sun into an ovoid shape when it nears the horizon, in
one of the books, Sol ellipticus (1615), he had given Galileo in unreciprocated
collegiality!" Galileo did not like it. It showed that he had missed something
important in his solar surveys. He thanked Scheiner in the Assayer by reducing
the effect to a trivial case of foreshortening owing to the displacement of the
observer's eye from the center of our atmosphere. "The entire mystery requires
no doctrine more profound than to understand why a circle seen straight on
looks round to us, while looked at in foreshortening it appears oval."!" The
effect of atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations was then an
agitated and fundamental problem implicated, as Scheiner remarked, in optics
and meteorology as well as in astronomy.':" Again Galileo ran from physics to
geometry and disposed of the baby with the bathwater. And again his inability
to appreciate the difficult position of a Jesuit struggling to introduce new
knowledge caused him to make an enemy of a potential ally.

292
GALILEO
Scheiner's ongoing exposition of sunspots and marginally freethinking
about their cosmic implications had placed him in a position deserving more
sympathy than censure.':" General Acquaviva had ordered him to avoid
novelties.':" Acquaviva's successor Muzio Vitelleschi frequently admonished
Scheiner to diminish his expenditure on instruments, to remember his vow
of poverty, and to be more charitable to his better-disciplined colleagues."?
Had Galileo known these orders, they would not have mollified him. He
picked on Scheiner, as he did on Grassi, as representatives of the Jesuit math­
ematicians too cowardly to stand up for him in 1616.151
Another matter on which Vitelleschi felt obliged to instruct Scheiner was
politics. Avoid them, he ordered, or, rather, avoid appearing political when
using your position as confessor to Archduke Karl I, and friend to Archduke
Leopold, to influence their brother Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor,
"for the benefit of themselves and of all Christendom."!" The brothers were
at the heart of the Counter Reformation beyond the Alps. Ferdinand's poli­
cies prompted the action that set off the Thirty Years' War, and Karl and
Leopold strongly supported the papal shock troops, the Jesuits. Leopold
built them a church in Ingolstadt, Karl a college in Neisse. Scheiner super­
vised the construction of both and, perhaps, Leopold's study of astronomy,
in which the archduke took an informed interest. When he visited his sister
the Grand Duchess of Tuscany in 1618, Leopold formed a tie to Galileo, who
subsequently sent him copies of his treatise on the tides ("read it as fiction")
and his Letters on sunspots (read it as a corrective to Scheiner). Galileo and
Guiducci dedicated their attack on the Roman Jesuits to Leopold. None of
this drove a wedge between Leopold and Scheiner. In 1624 the archduke sent
his protégé to Rome to obtain Urban's approval for the Neisse college and
its finances. Scheiner found the going tough, since Urban had little sym­
pathy for Jesuits or Austrians; but it proved easier to find support for the
college than for the Ingolstadt church, which, to Scheiner's infinite chagrin,
collapsed as it climbed into the sky.!"
While Urban procrastinated, Scheiner tried to print his 784-page, in-folio
page-turner on sunspots. Being four years in press, it made a perfect occu­
pation for a waiting supplicant.'>' The odd title of the book, Rosa ursina,
paid tribute to the dukes of Orsini, whose emblem was a rose and whose
cash paid for the printing. This represented a serious and symbolic shift of
patronage, since the Orsini had been friendly to Galileo.!" When printing
began, Scheiner expressed his fear that Galileo would get wind of it and

VAINGLORY
293
somehow make trouble. And no doubt Galileo would have protested had
he known that the first of Rosa's four books would be dedicated to him. In
it Scheiner itemized their respective contributions by date, claimed priority
for what was his, and lovingly chronicled Calileo's errors, some two dozen
in all. He would pay for his lèse-majesté.!" Scheiner followed this chronicle
with explanations and depictions of the instruments he had used. His accu­
mulated observations occupy no fewer than seventy plates. The final sec­
tion of Rosa, some 310 pages, considers the theory of sunspots, the tilt and
spin of the sun, the nature of flares and prominences, and the bearing of it
all on scripture. The spin of the sun by no means implied that of the earth,
which rests while the heavens turn, "as the holy fathers require.v'"
The book did not impress the Galileists. We know Castelli's reaction:
"Revolting ... I am disgusted by the atrocious and poisonous rage ... arro­
gance ... ignorance, conceit, hatred." He added from the vantage point of
Urban's entourage that he could not abide Scheiner's parade of intimacy
with all the archdukes in the universe.!" The ponderous Rosa proved
a greater weight to Scheiner than to his enemy. The book's first patron,
Cardinal Alessandro Orsini, died before Rosa appeared. Paolo Giordano II
Orsini, once and then perhaps still a friend of Galileo's, picked up the tab.
He considered his investment an advance against sales. It turned out, how­
ever, that few people cared enough about sunspots and sun spats to buy
800 pages of Latin on the subject. Rosa failed commercially and Scheiner
suffered under debt for many years. After a decade of nagging by General
Vitelleschi, he discharged much of it by selling his instruments.!" Vitel­
leschi's successor Vincenzo Caraffa had no patience with poor Scheiner.
Relieve yourself of your belongings! Burn the letters you have written on
the shortcomings of others!"? Obey! The recipient of these demeaning
directives, a man 77 years of age, had been a distinguished member of his
order for over fifty years.
During Scheiner's time in Rome, the big man at the Roman College was
Grassi, whose persecution by Galileo Scheiner knew from its beginning,
since Archduke Leopold, the dedicatee of Calileo -Cuiducci's Discourse,
sent him a copy. Grassi in turn followed the sun spat and doubtless sym­
pathized with Scheiner, whose contributions he knew only too well, as he
read (or said he read) the entire Rosa for the Jesuit censorship.'?' Unlike
Scheiner, Grassi had too many obligations during the late 1620S to squan­
der time nursing the wounds inflicted by the Assayer. But the fool, dunce,

294
GALILEO
beast, buffalo, scorpion, and snake found enough leisure while serving
simultaneously as professor, vice-rector, and librarian of the Roman Col­
lege, and architect and builder of its church, to publish a response to the
Assayer in Paris in 1626, without the usual permissions.v- As we know,
it played the high theological card of the eucharist. Grassi admitted that
Galileo had said too little about atomism to allow a definitive deduction
of his opinion about transubstantiation. "Yet I cannot avoid giving vent to
certain scruples." They came to this: atomism deserves a stronger sanction
than Copernican astronomy. "What has not been granted for the opinion
on the earth's motion, although its immobility is not considered among
the fundamental points of our faith, will be even less permissible, if I am
not mistaken, for that which constitutes the essential point of faith or con­
tains all other essential points."?'
Galileo regarded the charges about the eucharist as equally shameful
and impotent. The highest authorities had granted the imprimatur for
the Assayer; Grassi's response did not have the permission even of local
authorities. The Roman Jesuits repaired that omission by issuing a new
edition with the required permissions. Galileo asked Castelli, whose serv­
ice to the Barberini had brought him close to Ciampoli and other high
officials, to ask Riccardi whether Grassi's charges now carried weight.
Riccardi replied that he did not think so and that he would always stand
up for Galileo-but not in every little matter that might come before the
Holy Office. He was feeling pressure from his Dominican brothers for
his leniency toward novelty. He and the Roman lynxes advised Galileo
to ignore Grassi on this round and return to the Dialogue.164 Galileo went
back to sticking pins in Simplicio. He finished the first draft of the great
work in 1629. That was also the year in which Melchior Inchofer, the third
Jesuit conspicuous in Galileo's case, turned up in Rome and began his
rapid climb to favor.
Inchofer was perhaps the quirkiest character in Galileo's quixotic adven­
tures. Born into a Lutheran family in Hungary, he heard the message of the
Jesuit missionaries, converted to Catholicism and, in 1607, at the age of 22,
began his novitiate. After completing his studies he was assigned to the
Jesuit College at Messina in Sicily, where he taught all subjects from logic
to theology, held responsible administrative posts, and interested himself in
the correspondence of the Virgin Mary. According to a legend kept green in
Messina although condemned as apocryphal by the Inquisition, the Mother

VAINGLORY
295
of God had instructed the Messinians in the true faith by a letter then still
extant. Inchofer demonstrated its genuineness in a large folio published in
1629 that attracted the rapt attention of the Congregation of the Index. Closer
to home, the book outraged the Archbishop of Palermo, Giovanni Doria,
who regarded it as an aggravation of the contest between the center of Span­
ish influence in Palermo and the College of Jesuits in Messina for cultural
control of the island. General Vitelleschi offered Inchofer every support and
ordered him to Rome to justify his book there. It could not escape censure
in Sicily, where the Spanish Inquisition held sway.!"
Did Inchofer believe that Mary of Galilee was in correspondence with
the citizens of Messina? The freethinking Gabriel Naudé, who arrived
in Rome almost simultaneously with Inchofer to become librarian to a
French cardinal, Jean-François de Bagny, thought not. Naudé put it to
Inchofer that the citizens had forged the letter. "He replied that he knew
all the reasons to think so as well as I did, and that he had written his
book to please and obey his superiors ... and that he did not believe at
all what was in the letter." With the logic he had learned from study with
Cremonini, Naudé deduced that Inchofer was a "sly and crafty fellow."166
That he was willing to do others' dirty work he made clear in one of the
many pseudonyms he invented to cloak his later writings: Benno Durkun­
durkhus S[k]lavus, perhaps German-Latin pidgin for "Benno, through
and through a slave (or Slav)."
Durkundurkhus must have had considerable charm. He obtained a deci­
sion from the qualificators of the Holy Office and from Father Monster that
the earlier decree regarding the Virgin's letter applied only to assertions of its
genuineness; "but if the author only proposes [his argument] as probable, or
not impossible ... he can publish a second, corrected edition of his book." And
so he did, with "conjecture" in place of "truth vindicated" in his title, using the
same palette of cosmetics that Ingoli had employed in improving Copernicus'
De revolutionibus. Inchofer became a great friend of Riccardi and a political advi­
sor to Francesco Barberini. In this position, which he held from 1637 to 1647,
Inchofer would have had opportunities to disclose his character to Naudé,
who became Barberini's librarian in 1641.167 It was through Riccardi, who had
misjudged his character, that Inchofer, having just worked his way clear from
charges against his own work, had a place on a committee to decide whether
to charge Galileo. Through him Grassi and Scheiner could have a say in the
proceedings.

7.4 THE TILT
Suiting up
"Oh what a pleasant and precious gift you give me this Christmas by telling
me that your Dialogue is now happily concluded!" Thus Ciampoli, who had
been urging Galileo to finish his masterpiece, reacted to the news that after
thirty years on and off the job, Galileo had managed to bring it to fruition.!"
The Christmas in question was that of 1629. The following spring, as Galileo
finished his polishing, Castelli and Buonarroti, the mathematician and the
poet, were smoothing its way to Rome. Since Cesi and the lynxes were to
see it through the press as they had the Assayer, Galileo needed permission to
print in Rome. Castelli reported that Riccardi, then recently named Master of
the Sacred Palace, was well disposed and that Ciampoli would undertake to
secure Urban's assent. The protective cardinal nephew, Francesco Barberini,
had reservations, however, about the argument from the tides. Castelli reas­
sured him. The argument was entirely hypothetical: if the earth moved with
the diurnal and annual motions, tides would occur necessarily. The cardinal
objected that if the earth so moved, it would be a star, which seemed to him
contrary to scripture. "To this I replied that you would have ... proved that
the earth is not a star, a thing very easy to show, since it is easy to prove that
the moon is the moon and not the earth, Mars is Mars and not the moon or
Venus, and so on." To which the insightful cardinal replied that Galileo had
better supply this easy proof if the rest of his book was to pass muster."?
Cardinal Francesco correctly divined that Galileo did not intend to bring
the earth down from the Copernican heaven. Puffing the Dialogue just before
finishing it, Galileo wrote to Elia Diodati, a Parisian lawyer who had come
to Florence especially to meet him, that it contained besides material on the
tides "many other problems and a very ample confirmation of the Copernican
system [accomplished] by showing the emptiness of everything that Tycho
and others have brought against it."170 However, the tides alone were more
than enough. "If the earth is immobile, tides cannot occur; if it moves with
the motions already assigned to it [by Copernicus], they follow necessarily."
To the Bolognese count Cesare Marsili, then soon to be elected to the lynxes,
Galileo confided that he could not separate his book from heliocentrism. "I'm
dragging forward my Dialogo del jlusso e riflusso, which drags along with it the
Copernican system"."! But on 3 May 1630, when Galileo arrived in Rome with

VAINGLORY
297
his long manuscript, no one other than he knew exactly what was buried in it,
although the local gossips chattered that it refuted Jesuit opinions and that its
author cast horoscopes. Galileo received his usual cordial welcome from the
Barberini.!"
On 17 or 18 May Galileo had a long private interview with Urban. Although
the gist of their conversation is not known, it eases understanding of subse­
quent events to suppose that by 1630 Urban had come to see that a dem­
onstration by Galileo of the superiority of the Copernican hypothesis to its
competitors might be useful to the church. He had liked the preamble to
Calileo's unsent Letter to Ingoli, as read to him by Ciampoli; which, it may be
remembered, justified presenting the advantages of the heliocentric hypoth­
esis as a demonstration that the Roman Catholic Church had understood
the astronomical and physical arguments when it condemned the Coperni­
can system as opposed to scripture.173 The May interview might have run as
follows:
Gal. You know, Your Holiness, that knowledgeable people here
and abroad laugh at the policy toward Copernicus decided in
1616. I want to counter their mockery by showing that Catho­
lic astronomers know at least as much about the cosmos as
Protestants do.
Urb. And you, Your Lordship, know that consideration of God's
omnipotence makes asserting the absolute truth of any astro­
nomical system very rash and perhaps heretical. If we allowed
you to proceed, how would you accomplish both your pur­
pose and ours: to show the world that Italians understand
astronomical hypotheses and their uncurably hypothetical
nature?
Gal. I would write--in fact I have written-a Dialogue in which per­
sons representing the old and new systems and a man of aggres­
sive common sense discuss the pros and cons; and I have given
the Copernican spokesman the strongest arguments to show
that we know them. It is a duel in masquerade, like my Assayer,
which I believe Your Sanctity was gracious enough to like, and
does not ascend above the level of hypothesis.
Urb. We could develop some enthusiasm about this project if we
trusted you to stay strictly within the realm of hypothesis. Then
you could frame your masquerade with a preface similar to the

GALILEO
one you wrote in your Letter to Ingoli and a postscript declaring
that however cogent the arguments given, neither system can
ever be shown to be true. If we give our permission, you must
put the preface and postscript in your own voice. This message
is much too important to be imparted by masked men. Coming
from you, it would establish the proper status of natural science
and help free the church from the unhealthy coupling of theol­
ogy and Aristotelian philosophy on which the Dominicans and
the Jesuits have built their empires.
Gal. Agreed. The stronger the case made for Copernicus, the more
effective will be the denial that we can ever know it to be true.
Urb. To be sure. And to be sure that you do not get carried away,
we shall assign your friends Ciampoli and Riccardi to work
with you on the preface and postscript. Your Dialogue will
be as a shield against those who would derive absolute truth
from a source other than Holy Church. I put my trust in
you-policed by Ciampoli and Riccardi.'?'
A week after his long interview with Urban, Galileo dined, at Morandi's
invitation, with Raffaelo Visconti and Ludovico Corbusio, whose positions
suggest the purpose of the get-together. Corbusio, onetime Inquisitor of
Florence, had become a consultor to the Holy Office. Visconti, whom Gali­
leo had met through Morandi in 1624, had become Riccardi's lieutenant and
would read the Dialogue for the Roman censorship. On 17 June, Urban spoke
to Riccardi about the book.!" Perhaps the pope then gave the three orders
that Riccardi repeated a year later in Urban's name to the Florentine inquisi­
tor Clemente Egidi. First, the title must not refer to the tides but to math­
ematical considerations of the Copernican view. Second, "with the intention
of proving that without God's Revelation and sacred doctrine the phenom­
ena could be saved on this view," Galileo should explode all the objections
against the Copernican hypothesis suggested by experience and peripatetic
philosophy. Third, "it must be made clear that the purpose of the work is
solely to demonstrate that the Catholic Church knows all the reasons that
bear on the question, and that it was not for not knowing them that the
Copernican opinion was banned in Rome."176
In July 1631, Riccardi sent Egidi a fourth requirement, the administration
of a "medicine of the end" to balance the draft preface he also supplied. This
medicine, which we will call "Urban's Simple," must be compounded of the

VAINGLORY
299
"arguments about Divine Omnipotence explained to [Galileo] by Our Lord,
which should quiet the mind though there might seem no way through the
Pythagorean arguments." Riccardi further instructed Egidi that the postscript
(fine) containing the medicine "must concern the same argument" as the pref­
ace, that is, return to the argument of the Letter to Ingoli.l77 Why should the
Master of the Sacred Palace instruct the Florentine Inquisitor about a book to
be published in Rome? Therein lies a story.
After hurriedly reading the text that Galileo had with him in Rome in 1630,
neither Riccardi nor Visconti raised any serious objection, merely small points
that Galileo could correct before coming back to Rome for final approval and
printing of the text. Following a final friendly meeting with the pope and the
cardinal nephew, Galileo left for Florence "having completed his business to
his entire satisfaction." Thus ambassador Niccolini, who went on, no doubt
to the grand duke's satisfaction, "he is esteemed and honored by the entire
[Papal] Court, as he deserves to be."178 He was virtually a member of it, on
two counts. For one, Urban assigned him a pension, or, rather, reassigned to
him the pension he had promised Vincenzo, who had refused the qualifying
condition of wearing a tonsure. That did not put off Galileo, who became a
cleric in the summer of 1630 to the extent of wearing a tonsure and reciting a
daily office. He did not realize much from this investment. He wore his hair
clipped for several years before the pension, drawn from a canonry of the
Cathedral of Brescia, started, and then it too was clipped, to 40 scudi from the
100 that Urban had promised.'?"
Secondly, Galileo figured on an official list of savants whose presence in
Rome between 1630 and 1633 distinguished Urban's reign. The original draft
of this list of apes urbanae ("Urban's bees") praised Galileo too fulsomely to
survive his condemnation. It contained, besides the titles of his published
works, the verses in which Urban had praised his discoveries, mention of
unpublished studies on mechanics that would "illuminate all of philoso­
phy," and the information that Diodati had come all the way from France
just to talk with him. The author of the Apes, Leone Allacci, reader in Greek
at the Vatican Library, also volunteered, without a hint of censure, that he
had read a tract by Galileo on the motion of the earth. None of this material
apart from the mention of Diodati survived into the published Apes urba­
nae.180 (That mention would have been cancelled too if Allacci had known
that Diodati had promoted French editions of Sarpi's condemned histories.)
Allacci's hive included many important actors in Calileo's story, for example

300
GALILEO
Ciampoli, Grassi, Riccardi, Inchofer, and Scheiner, who was still in Rome
in 1630, packing the 14 crates of books, instruments, relics (10 saintly skel­
etons), and Agnus dei (12,000 in all) that he had acquired over the previous
six years."!
Soon after, Galileo, now back in Florence, began intensive revisions of his
manuscript, the aspects that had looked so favorable in Rome began to dim.
The metaphor applies only too well. The Morandi case and the bull Inscruta­
bilis against astrologers made it prudent to avoid everything astrological. The
crackdown did not hit Galileo directly, but his enemies took comfort in his
reputation as an astrologer and his friendship with Morandi and Visconti,
whereas Scheiner had caught the crest of the new wave in Rome by con­
demning astrology in Rosa as "laughable" and "worthless."!" Galileo thought
it useful to insert a jibe at astrologers in the Dialogue. It is surprisingly mild
and awkwardly placed. Sagredo and Salviati have just had a good laugh at
philosophers who claimed that Aristotle's writings "contained" anticipations
of modern inventions like the telescope. Of course, Sagredo jeered, Aristotle
contains these anticipations, but only in the sense that a block of marble
does a statue, or as heathen oracles do the future, that is, after the event.
Salviati: "And why do you leave out the prophesies of the astrologers, which
are so clearly seen in horoscopes ... after their fulfillment?"!"
It did not take an astrologer to see that the death of the Prince of the Lynxes
on 1 August 1630 would compound the difficulties of publishing the Dialogue.
It proved catastrophic. Cesi's death effectively ended the lynxes. The obvious
successor, the cardinal nephew, declined the honor; no one else had the posi­
tion, dedication, and wherewithal.!" Still, since Galileo had almost obtained
permission to print from Riccardi, and he had friendly editors near the Bar­
berini in the persons of Riccardi, Ciampoli, Visconti, and Castelli, it made
best sense to complete the original plan and publish in Rome. Without Cesi,
however, Galileo would have to negotiate directly with Monster Riccardi and
oversee the printing. That would require a long stay in Rome. "A plague on
it," he might have said, and, 10, there was plague, carried into Italy by a Holy­
Imperial army come to do battle against Urban and the French in the subwar
of the Mantuan succession, a disastrous consequence of the pope's irrepress­
ible rapacity. By the summer of 1630 plague was in Florence. One of Galileo's
rustic servants died of it. "[U]se every possible precaution to protect yourself
from the danger," Maria Celeste wrote, prescribing as "the best remedy of
all ... a thorough contrition and penitence." Even with this medicine Galileo

could not have traveled easily to Rome, which established elaborate pre­
cautions to keep the plague at bay. These barred or delayed entry to people
from plague-ridden places and required fumigation or confiscation of items,
including manuscripts, that might carry contagion.':" Galileo asked to print
in Florence.
After consulting Visconti, who would soon be banished from Rome over
the Morandi affair, Castelli reported that publication in Florence would not
be a problem and urged that Galileo obtain permission from the censors
there quickly, as Urban's favor was fickle. With astonishing speed-on 12
September, some two weeks after receiving Castelli's letter-Galileo had the
desired imprimatur.!" The business was highly irregular as no censor had
approved the text. Riccardi had expected Galileo to return to Rome to iron
out the remaining wrinkles; but because of the plague he agreed that most of
the book could be reviewed in Florence, reserving for himself the beginning
and the end. A letter to Galileo from the wife of the Tuscan ambassador to
Rome, Caterina Riccardi Niccolini, set forth the arrangement. Caterina Nic­
colini had helped pressure her cousin the Monster into separating respon­
sibility for the body of the book (which was assigned to the Dominican
theologian Giacinto Stefani in Florence) from the head and tail; and, when
the Monster, buffeted by shifting political winds that made piloting people
who sailed close to reefs hazardous, continued to procrastinate, she obtained
copies of these disjecta membra and insisted that he approve them promptly.':"
In the summer of 1631, having sent his preface and instructions to Egidi, Ric­
cardi washed his hands of the problem. If you follow the instructions faith­
fully, he wrote, " the book will not encounter any obstacle here in Rome and
Your Reverence will be able to please the author and serve His Serene High­
ness [Grand Duke Ferdinand II], who is very anxious about the matter." The
matter seemed to be in hand. Stefani required only a few small changes.!"
The Dialogue went to press around 1 June 1631, before Galileo had Riccardi's
corrections and draft preface in hand. The printer finished the first three
days at the end of the year, the entire book on 21 February 1632. The next day
Galileo presented a copy to its dedicatee, Grand Duke Ferdinando.!" Gali­
leo regretted that he had had to drop all reference to the tides from his title,
since the publisher had counted on the word, with its hint to those who knew
Calileo's arguments, to boost his sales. The change of title may well explain
why the Dialogue begins without a proper mise-en-scène; perhaps the original
opening concerned the tides, and survives in Simplicio's contemplation of

302
GALILEO
their turning when his gondola beached en route to the third day's discus­
sion.'?" The preface, 'To the discerning reader," followed Riccardi's draft. His
purpose, Galileo wrote, was to defend the church and Italian science from the
charge of ignorance in banning heliocentrism. "Upon hearing such carping
insolence, my zeal could not be contained." He had been in Rome in 1616 and
had experienced for himself the competence with which the Congregations
of the Index and the Inquisition drew up their "salutary edict" against Coper­
nicus. To right the balance, Galileo took the Copernican side in the Dialogue,
"proceeding as with a pure mathematical hypothesis and striving by every
artifice to represent it as superior to supposing the earth motionless."!"
Riccardi had not specified a place for the administration of the medicine of
the end. Galileo chose to put it in the mouth of Simplicio. The nincompoop
allowed that although he esteemed Salviati's ideas about the tides he could
not admit them as true and conclusive. "Indeed, keeping always before my
mind's eye a most solid doctrine that I once heard from a most eminent and
learned person, and before which one must fall silent, I know that if asked
whether God in his infinite power and wisdom could have conferred upon
the watery element its observed reciprocating motion using some other
means than moving its containing vessels, both of you would reply that he
could have, and that he would have known how to do this in many ways
which are unthinkable to our minds." Salviati: "An admirable and angelic
doctrine, and well in accord with another one, also Divine ... that we cannot
discover the work of His hands." Sagredo: "Let us go and enjoy an hour's
refreshment in the gondola that awaits US."192
Galileo knew from first hand how strongly, even emotionally, Urban clung
to his almost unanswerable argument.'?' Why then did he not give Urban's
Simple to Salviati or Sagredo? That is because both of them, and Simplicio
too (if he was a distillate of Borro, Buonamici, and Cremonini) opposed
mixing theology with physics. The out-of-character argument would spoil
the masquerade. That was Urban's view too. He wanted Galileo to say, in his
own voice, something like this:
The comedy has ended. Italian honor and the reputation of Holy
Church are saved from the calumniators who would destroy our
faith. But do not deduce from this happy outcome, gentle reader, that
you are free to assert the absolute truth of a physical system even if
the arguments in its favor seem unanswerable. For as I learned long

VAINGLORY
303
ago from His Holiness, any such assertion would derogate from the
Omnipotence of God, who in His wisdom and power can do or make
anything that does not involve Him in a contradiction. The argument
of His Holiness is in fact and logic unanswerable. A true Christian
must bend the knee and fall silent before it.
Had Galileo written such words, philosophers, mathematicians, and astrolo­
gers whose theories implicitly limited God's past and future actions would
find themselves opposed to the greatest mathematician in Italy, and perhaps
the world. But Galileo could not speak Urban's words. That would have
been entirely out of his character. It would have amounted to a denial of his
mission.'?"
Galileo did not, and probably could not, anticipate the effect of allow­
ing Simplicio to express Urban's Simple. Throughout his trial and after it
he protested that he had done nothing wrong, that he had honored Urban's
instructions by administering the prescribed medicine of and at the end. 195 In
his black-and-white world, the medicine was either present or absent; and if
present and taken, it did not matter much who administered it. He reckoned
that the least implausible dispenser among the dialogists was Simplicio. In
giving the words to him, Galileo had performed as required while remaining
true to himself and the two progressive characters in his comedy. To Urban's
subtler mind, the medicine was not fit for purpose unless swallowed by the
man most in need of it, his assertive old friend Galileo.
Riding forth
Galileo's masked comedy staged in Venice received high marks there if
Micanzio's response was representative. "I do not mean to flatter, but I tell
you sincerely that Non est factum tale opus in universa terra ... But my God, how
well you have brought to life that worthy man Sig. Sagredo! God save me,
I think that I hear him speak." On the road, however, in Rome, the faithful
resurrection of Sagredo did not count.!" Eight copies reached the Holy City
in late May 1632, in the baggage of Filippo Magalotti, a friend of Galileo and
Guiducci and a close relative of the Barberini. Galileo directed that the first
copy go to the cardinal nephew and the others to Riccardi, Niccolini, Ciam­
poli, Campanella, and two representatives of the enemy, Ludovico Serristori
(a consultor to the Holy Office) and Leone Santi (a professor at the Roman

304
GALILEO
College). Magalotti was to retain the eighth.'?' Castelli, still near the supreme
power, read the cardinal's copy, with as much absorption, he told Galileo,
reaching for the perfect compliment, as if it were the Furioso. Interested Jesu­
its could read Santi's copy. Soon word and rumor about the book's content
reached the ears of most people in Rome interested in such things. Who first
undertook to inform Urban about the treatment of his cherished principle
may have been blown up in the explosion that followed. The pope ordered
through Riccardi that the publisher cease distribution and that all copies
already sold be recalled or confiscated. That was in July 1632.198
The order ended with an instruction to the Florentine Inquisitor to look
into the meaning of the three dolphins biting one another's midriffs that
appeared on the title page of the Dialogue. That may indicate the pope's hair­
trigger sensitivity at the time the "Galileo affair" began. Were the dolphins
a cabalistic insult to Urban and his two brothers? Or to the Barberini cardi­
nals? Did they signify a hope or prediction of a replacement of the Barberini
bees by a family of fish? "In Rome they pardon atheists, sodomites, libertines
and other sorts of rascals, but they never pardon those who bad mouth the
Pope or his court, or who seem to question papal power."!" No doubt Urban
had some cause for his heightened sensitivity. He sensed betrayal all around
him. He had had to drop his long-time friend and agent Ciampoli for pre­
suming to know the papal mind and for flirting with the Spanish, who had
paid him a small pension (or retainer) for years; but after the great set-to in
the consistory of 8 March 1632, when Cardinal Borgia and Urban's younger
nephew Antonio Barberini almost came to blows over the pope's foreign
policy, the time for a purge of fellow-travelers in the Spanish interest had
arrivcd.ë" Worried about assassination, Urban took care to have his food
tasted, withdrew to Castel Gandolfo under high security, and ordered armed
patrols of the road to Rome. This worry was better founded than his suspi­
cion about the dolphins, which turned out to be the printer's trademark.'?'
The fall of Ciampoli had several elements in common with Galileo's. Both
men had enjoyed the friendship and admiration of Maffeo Barberini and
received substantial tokens of his favor when he became pope. He did not
want to act against either of them. But both made the mistake of taking him
for granted, of ignoring one or another of his pet opinions, and of behaving in
ways that made protecting them increasingly costly. Ciampoli's lavish lifestyle,
occasional orgies, and curtness when not toadying paralleled in their awk­
wardness Galilee's incurable badgering and ridicule of respectable savants and

VAINGLORY
305
clerics who disagreed with him.ë" And after their fall, both of Urban's former
friends made the same misjudgment in expecting him to relent. Ciampoli left
Rome quietly in October 1632 for a governorship of a territory in the Marches,
from which he tried desperately to return. Urban remained firm; Ciarnpoli's
banishment was perpetual. So, in a harder degree, would be Calileo's.'?'
It was rumored that the Jesuits had a hand in informing Urban about the
violations of the edict of 1616 and of Galileo's misuse of the medicine of the
end.P' They had regained influence at the Vatican as Urban was forced to favor
the Habsburgs. In 1631, in their Good Friday oration in the Sistine Chapel,
they had pointed out the destruction of their missions and colleges by "the
mob of furious pillagers" roaming Catholic Austria. The orator was Orazio
Grassi and the dedicatee of his printed text, the Italian head of the Span­
ish faction in the curia, was his patron Cardinal Ludovisi. The Jesuits sweet­
ened their message by bringing out a new and sumptuous edition of Urban's
poems with designs by Urban's favorite architect, Bernini.?" Whether Grassi
used his connections to help bring Galileo to book may be doubted. He said
that he had nothing to do with it and regretted the outcome. "He ruined
himself by being so fond of his own ideas and by not appreciating others. It
is no wonder that everyone conspired against him.'?"
However it came about, Urban knew in July 1632 that Galileo had not
honored his commitment to deal equally and mathematically, that is, hypo­
thetically, with the world systems, and that the powerful talisman of God's
omnipotence had turned to dust in Simplicio's mouth. When Urban came
to examine the book, his papal hackles rose before he reached the text.
Something fishier than the dolphins of the title page appeared on its verso:
three imprimaturs, one, undated, from Riccardi as Master of the Sacred
Palace and the others, dated 11 September 1632, from Pietro Niccolini and
Clemente Egidi, respectively the Archbishop and Chief Inquisitor of Flor­
ence. Since Riccardi had no authority outside Rome, Urban's suspicious
nose smelled a rat, or rather two. Ciampoli and Riccardi had misled him
to think that the manuscript of 1630 contained nothing not easily repaired;
Riccardi granted the imprimatur on Urban's voicing no fundamental objec­
tion (which, believing the work to be sound, he had no cause to do); and
then, having at last read the manuscript or some of it, Riccardi tried to be
true to his friendship with Galileo and his obligations as a censor by shift­
ing the burden of approval to a jurisdiction outside Rome. Riccardi may
have been as surprised as the pope to see his imprimatur alongside those of

306
GALILEO
the Florentine officials. It appeared that Galileo had divided and conquered
the censorship by translating a provisional approval obtained in Rome into
a license to print, without strict prior review, in Florence. This was prob­
ably close to what did happen. Urban demanded an explanation. Riccardi
blamed the business on the Florentines and on Ciampoli, who had told him,
he claimed, that Urban had no objection to Galileo's general argument. 207
Urban accepted that Riccardi too was a victim of deceit and that Ciampoli
had choreographed the comedy of the Iicenses.?"
Much of the information about Ciampoli's involvement comes from a
report by Niccolini of unpleasant interviews he had with Urban on 4 and
11 September 1632. In the first interview, following the Grand Duke's orders,
Niccolini inquired why any suspicion should attach to a book so well for­
tified with licenses as Galileo's Dialogue. That was not the right approach.
The pope railed at Ciampoli and Riccardi. Niccolini then asked that Gali­
leo be allowed to come to Rome to justify himself. Urban grew angrier: the
Holy Office (to which the matter had not been referred) does not negoti­
ate. And then: Galilee's book "involv[ es] great harm to religion (indeed, the
worst ever conceived)"; he has meddled with "the most perverse subject one
could ever come across"; his book is "extremely perverse," "troublesome and
dangerous," "pernicious.'?" A few clues to what this rhetoric, which seems
more appropriate to plague than astronomy, applied occur in other phrases
of Niccolini's reports. Urban said that Galileo knew full well where the prob­
lems lay, "since we have discussed them with him and he has heard them
from ourselves." Galileo had "dared [to enter] when he should not have, into
the most serious and dangerous subjects which could be stirred up at this
time.'?'?
What was so perverse and deadly, so menacing to religion ("indeed, the
worst [menace] ever conceived"), what so troublesome at that very moment?
No doubt undermining the papacy by misleading a trusting pope during
war and plague would qualify as perverse and pernicious. Still, this would
not make Calileo's book so dreadfully harmful to religion. When Urban
gave vent to these extravagant accusations, a special panel, which he had
appointed in August to determine whether Galileo should be brought
before the Holy Office, was hard at work. The unusual procedure of a prelimi­
nary review indicated that the pope, as Niccolini reported on 5 September, then
still regarded Galileo as a friend. The panel's findings convinced Urban that Cali­
leo valued neither his friendship nor his advice. It had obtained a document from

VAINGLORY
307
the Inquisition's archives that, as Riccardi volunteered to Niccolini, "is alone
sufficient to ruin Mr Galilei completely." This was the injunction or precept
read in Bellarmine's house in 1616. We know that the precept forbade Galileo
to "hold, teach, or defend [Copernicanism] in any way whatever, orally or in
writing," under threat of further proceedings by the Holy Office. Now certain
of Galileo's bad faith, Urban informed the ambassador that he had no alterna­
tive but to allow the Inquisition to proceed."! Still, the charges remained at the
level of bad behavior. The discovery of the injunction might even have done
Galileo some good, since it deflected attention from Riccardi's negligence
and opened the possibility of disposing of the case without entering into
dangerous subjects."?
Urban's special panel consisted of Master Riccardi, who had his monstrous
hide to save; the papal theologian Agostino Oreggi, Urban's Bellarmine; and
Riccardi's friend, the Jesuit Melchior Inchofer, expected to be sympathetic
to people hounded by the censorship.ê!' Inchofer turned out to be hostile to
Copernican ideas and a champion of Scheiner, the target, as they both saw it,
of most of the vituperation in the Dialogue. It is likely that the panel assigned
Inchofer the job of reviewing the anonymous accusation, based on the Assayer,
that Galileo believed in an atomism irreconcilable with Tridentine teaching.
An unsigned statement in Inchofer's hand, which appears to be a rephrasing
and considered judgment of the accusation, survives among the papers of the
Congregation of the Index. Assuming that Inchofer drew up this judgment for
and during the deliberations of the special panel, we have a second and more
powerful reason for Urban's wrath and alarm. Inchofer's statement would
have reinforced a connection in his mind among personal betrayal, disdain for
his voluntarism, and menace to dogma.?" We are coming closer to pernicious
doctrine.
Pushed to extremes, Urban's basis for evaluating crimes against the faith
could convict Galileo of denying such divine attributes as freedom of action,
omniscience, and omnipotence. These denials truly would have been per­
nicious and subversive. Many collateral matters could be bound up with
Galileo's lèse-majesté, for example judicial astrology, which Urban had then
recently anathematized on voluntaristic and other grounds.215 The problem
of salvation and grace, which had brought the Jesuits and Dominicans into
unresolvable conflict, involved the same sorts of questions of divine and
human freedom, or so Oreggi insinuated by inserting his report of the con­
versation between Barberini and Galileo in 1616 into a discussion of just

308
GALILEO
these topics.":' And there is a logical parallel between Urban's reasoning,
which took as fundamental the possibility of saving the appearances while
transforming their causes, and the Tridentine doctrine of the eucharist,
whereas Calileo's atomism might make transubstantiation a logical impos­
sibility by requiring an atom to appear as bread and not-bread simultane­
ously. Although Galilco's trial was not about atomism, astrology, freewill,
salvation, grace, or divine attributes, many or all of them probably were in
Urban's mind when he castigated Galileo's doctrine as "the worst [menace]
ever perceived.'?" Had Galileo only lived up to his bargain, had he not
spoiled, but fortified, Urban's medicine!
The panel's unsigned report of September 1632 twists the tale slightly to
exonerate Riccardi from any oversight or wrongdoing. In order to allow
Galileo to talk with publishers, the report declared, Riccardi had given a
provisional imprimatur for printing in Rome on the understanding that he
would review the sheets as they came from the press. When Galileo insisted
on printing in Florence, Riccardi told the Florentine Inquisitor what needed
to be done, furnished the core of a proper preface, and let go of the busi­
ness. Against the instructions sent by Riccardi and issued by Bellarmine,
the report continued, Galileo argued cosmology absolutely and not hypo­
thetically. Specifically, he used the Roman imprimatur without permission;
printed the preface in distinctive type as if it did not belong to the book;
put the "medicine of the end in the mouth of a fool"; mistreated opposing
authors (here may be an echo of Scheiner's complaint) "and those most used
by the Holy Church"; declared that he understood geometrical theorems as
well as God did; and attributed the tides to nonexistent motions of the earth.
All true and all, in the opinion of the commission, amendable, "if the book
were judged to have some utility which would warrant such a favor,'?"
Knocked down
In late September 1632, soon after the special panel had given its judgment,
the cardinal nephew instructed the Florentine Inquisitor to direct Galileo to
make himself available to the Holy Office in Rome during October. Galileo
tried to decline this invitation on the grounds of age and infirmity. Through
his friend and admirer ambassador Niccolini he wrote to the cardinal nephew
asking to be allowed to defend himself in writing or, if a trial was necessary,
that it be held in Florence. The journey, hard enough at any time, would be

VAINGLORY
309
the death of him during a plague. Galileo added a most mysterious refer­
ence to a wise and saintly man, and a most exact and economical theologian,
who had encouraged him to write the Dialogue. "[A]lmost like an echo of the
Holy Spirit, [I heard] a very short but admirable and most holy assertion
suddenly come out of the mouth of a person who is most eminent in learn­
ing and venerable for the holiness of his life; that is, an assertion which, in no
more than ten words cleverly and beautifully combined, summarizes what
one can gather from the lengthy discussions scattered in the books of the
sacred doctors." Galileo did not disclose the name of the holy man who had
reduced St Thomas to the length of an Ave Maria."? Niccolini advised against
delivering the letter as the Inquisition would demand to know the identity
of the taciturn theologian. On further instruction, however, he passed it to
the cardinal who showed it to the pope. They did not fall for any of Galileo's
stories. No more did the copies of his Letter to Christina, which he had sent to
Riccardi, help his case."?
Niccolini tried to move Urban "to pity poor Mr. Galileo, who is now so old
and whom I love and adore." Urban pitied, and allowed the culprit to come
in a litter with all comforts, but come he must. Urban added the papal prayer
that God would forgive Calileo's error of falling into "an intrigue like this
after His Holiness himself (when he was cardinal) had delivered him from
it."m From which it appears that Urban believed that he had kept Galilee's
name and writings out of the condemnation of Copernican works issued by
the Index in 1616. Galileo not only had not recognized the author or favor of
his earlier deliverance, but had rejected both by repeating his original sin.
Niccolini returned to his observation that Galileo had published with the
approval of Riccardi. That did not help. Riccardi was in trouble over endors­
ing the Dialogue, "which he should never have done, as the general of the
Dominicans and everyone else says." Urban may not have known that Nic­
colini had some responsibility for the endorsement, since he had appealed to
friendship with Galileo, and his wife to allegiance to the Riccardi, to persuade
the vacillating Monster to sign off on the manuscript of the Dialogue. m
As pressure mounted to push him to Rome, Galileo fell into depression.
Buonarroti saw him on 10 October and reported to the cardinal nephew
that their friend was plunged into deep melancholy.?" Galileo had himself
examined by three physicians who found him a physical wreck. His pulse
was intermittent, from which they inferred a general debilitation of "the vital
faculty." He complained of frequent dizziness, hypochondriacal melancholy,

310
GALILEO
weakness of the stomach, sleeplessness, pain throughout the body, and
other ailments, to which, the doctors said, others could attest. They had
no trouble locating his heavy fleshy hernia and ruptured peritoneum. "All
of which is serious and evidently any small external cause could place his
life in danger." The Holy Office did not believe the doctors' certificate and
directed Inquisitor Egidi to inquire further into Galileo's health: should he
be malingering, he should be sent to Rome in chains. The malefactor took
the hint and left Florence on his own, on 20 January 1633, for quarantine in
Sicna.?" His departure came between two other events most gratifying to
the pope. In November 1632 the invincible Protestant champion, Gustavus
Adolphus, whose alliance with France had placed Urban in an impossible
diplomatic position, fell in battle. And in February 1633 the Roman people
officially thanked him for his "paternal providence and exquisite diligence"
in keeping the plague from the city.225
Galileo arrived at Niccolini's home in Rome on 14 February in good health
and spirits, and immediately started chatting up officials of the Holy Office.
The Barberinis had not expected such boldness. The cardinal nephew agreed
that Galileo could remain with Niccolini but only if he ceased his visits and
avoided all socializing. Niccolini gathered from this relative kindness that
things might not go badly "despite the fact that His Holiness feels so nega­
tive about this business." Confined to quarters, knowing nothing about the
top-secret deliberations of the Holy Office, Galileo could do nothing in his
own defense. In this unfamiliar situation he received from Niccolini some
unfamiliar counsel. "I have advised him to show himself always ready to
obey and submit to whatever he is ordered to do, because this is the way
to mitigate the fervor of those who are fiercely excited and treat this trial as
a personal thing."226 By the end of February Niccolini could report that the
main issue seemed to be the personal injunction Galileo received in 1616.
The pope said as much in an interview on the zôth and added that Galileo's
doctrine was very bad, without, however, specifying the evil. The cardinal
nephew was less reticent. The problem involved "introducing some imagi­
nary dogma into the world, particularly in Florence, where ... intellects are
very subtle and curious." Niccolini: perhaps the Copernican is the stronger
side and Galileo could not help himself in seeming to prefer it? The Lord
Cardinal: "[ Galileo] knew how to express exquisitely and to justify wonder­
fully whatever he wanted [to say]." Here the cardinal spoke the truth.v? The
celebrated clarity of Galileo's prose left him no hiding place.

VAINGLORY
311
In his last important interview with the pope before Galileo went to the
Holy Office for examination, Niccolini obtained valuable information­
valuable to the historian, not to Galileo-about Urban's thinking. The pope
said that in dealing with new doctrines and Holy Scripture it is best to follow
the common opinion. May God forgive Galileo and help his fellow plotter
Ciampoli! "God is omnipotent and can do anything; but if He is omnipotent,
why do we want to bind him?" Niccolini replied that, as far as he knew, that
was Galileo's opinion too. "However, [the pope] got upset and told me that
one must not impose necessity on the blessed God; seeing that he was losing
his temper, I did not want to continue discussing what I did not understand."
Niccolini had good cause to worry. "I do not like His Holiness's attitude,
which is not at all mollified.'?"
Meanwhile Urban recalled the special panel (replacing Riccardi by a Thea­
tine theologian, Zaccaria Pasqualigo) to consider whether Galileo had vio­
lated the injunction "not to hold, teach, or defend [Copernicanism] in any
way whatever, orally or in writing." All members of the committee agreed
that Galileo taught and defended Copernicanism in the Dialogue. Oreggi did
not offer an opinion about whether Galileo also held it. Pasqualigo also did
not pronounce definitively, though he entertained the "strong opinion" that
Galileo held the condemned system."? Inchofer had no doubt. "I am of the
opinion that Galileo ... is vehemently suspected of firmly adhering to [the
Copernican] opinion, and indeed that he holds it." Inchofer adduced some
27 passages to support this conclusion giving particular emphasis to those
in which Galileo treated "despicably" those who held the contrary opin­
ion. "What Catholic ever conducted such a bitter dispute against heretics,
even regarding a truth of faith, as Galileo does against those who maintain
the earth's immobility?" Galileo had dismissed fixed-earth philosophers as
less than human, ridiculous, small-minded, half-witted, idiotic, and praised
Copernicans as superior intellects. This was not the way to dispute, to joust
hypothetically, to exercise the mind; it was war, "arrogant war," against
defenders of traditional philosophy.P'The reports of the special commission­
ers made it difficult to restrict Calileo's infraction to mere disobedience.'?'
In so far as Inchofer's report set the tone for discussion at the Holy Office,
the Jesuits helped to hasten and deepen Galileo's fall. Inchofer's expression
"vehemently suspected," which, as will appear, had a technical meaning,
reappeared in the formal charge eventually brought against Galileo. Sev­
eral well-placed contemporary observers, including Galileo, attributed his

312
GALILEO
troubles to the machinations of the Jesuits. About the time that Inchofer was
finishing his report, the informed gossip Naudé wrote that Scheiner and other
Jesuits, "who want to ruin [Galileo ]," were behind his troubles.i" Certainly
Scheiner was outraged by Galileo's "shameless attacks" on him and felt, as
Inchofer faithfully transmitted, that the Dialogue was a diatribe against his
and Locher's Disquisitiones mathematicae. And there may be an echo of Grassi
in Inchofer's dwelling on Calileo's megalomania."?
It is unlikely, however, that the Jesuit order bothered itself about Galileo
in the spring of 1633. General Vitelleschi had his hands full trying to salvage
colleges in the Germanies pillaged by Protestants, to protect and direct mis­
sions in the war zone, and, what might have been even more difficult, to
reconcile Francophile and Habsburg factions within the Society.'?" Apart
from Scheiner, Inchofer, and, perhaps, Grassi and their immediate circle, the
Jesuits probably contributed no more than indifference to Galileo's troubles.
Father Grienberger said as much to a mutual friend, and Galileo reported his
saying, perhaps with some touching up, to Diodati. "If Galileo had known
how to keep on friendly terms with the fathers of [the Roman] College, he
would be enjoying fame in the world, he would not have had any misfor­
tunes, and he would be able to write freely about anything, even the motion
of the earth." To which Galileo added the characteristic self-deceiving gloss,
"Thus you see that it is not this or that opinion which has caused the past and
present warfare against me, but rather it is my being held in disfavor by the
jesuits.'?" It was rather his opinions, and his insistence on forcing them on
others, that interested the Holy Office.
The Inquisition at last called Galileo to an interview in rnid-April iöjj. He
was kindly received and lodged, exceptionally, in the prosecutor's rooms at
the Minerva. Galileo had his own servant to wait upon him and food directly
from Niccolini's kitchen. Nonetheless he considered the treatment harsh. On
30 April, on the intervention of the commissary and the authority of Francesco
Barberini, Galileo returned to Niccolini's to "recover from the discomforts
and from his usual indispositions.'?" He immediately regained his health. On
22 May Niccolini reported that the affair would probably be completed by the
end of the month and offered a guess at the outcome. The book would be pro­
hibited and Galileo would be given some salutary penance to wash away his
disobedience to the injunction of 1616.237 The final act did not take place until
June. On the roth Urban, in good spirits, gave Niccolini an indication of the
decision. The book certainly would be condemned and Galileo detained for

VAINGLORY
313
some time in a convent like Santa Croce in Florence. Urban wanted it known,
to discourage other free thinkers, that the leniency of Galilee's treatment was
owing neither to the man nor to his physical condition. "Every punishment
has been mitigated out of regard for our master the Most Serene Grand Duke,
and this is the real and only reason why all possible accommodations have
been and will be made." Urban did allow Galileo creature comforts during his
trial in Rome that no one else in similar circumstances, whatever his civil or
ecclesiastical rank, had ever enjoyed.!"
The Holy Office had interrogated Galileo four times officially between
12 April and 21 June and once irregularly by the Commissary General, the
Dominican in charge of the case, Vincenzo Maculano, just the man for the
job, a combination of engineer (he was one of the pope's favorite military
architects) and inquisitor."? Maculano had relied on two accusations: Galileo
had violated the injunction of 1616 and had obtained the double imprimatur
of 1632 deceptively. Against the first accusation Galileo displayed the letter
he had solicited from Bellarmine to stop the rumors that he had been made
to abjure. No doubt the document surprised and disoriented Maculano, as it
not only countered the rumors against Galileo but stated that "only the dec­
laration made by the Holy Father and published by the sacred Congregation
of the Index has been revealed to him." This declaration prohibited defend­
ing or holding the Copernican motions. The further injunction or precept
given to Galileo at the same session in which Bellarmine read him the decree
of the Index was much more restrictive. Bellarmine's letter expressly limited
the "revelation" to Galileo to the milder text of the general prohibition pub­
lished by the Index."? But perhaps Bellarmine had not meant that no one had
spoken further to Galileo at the meeting but only that he had not?
Maculano: who else was present at the session and did any of them issue a
precept or injunction against you? Galileo: There were some Dominicans in
attendance. "It may be that I was given an injunction not to hold or defend
the said opinion, but I do not recall it." Maculano presented a copy of the
injunction. Galileo could not remember receiving it. "I do remember that the
injunction was that I could not hold or defend, and maybe that I could not teach.
I do not recall, further, that there was the phrase in any way whatever, but maybe
there was." In any case he had not bothered to keep in mind anything other
than Bellarmine's certificate, "which I relied upon and kept as a reminder."
Maculano turned to the imprimatur. Had Galileo told Riccardi about the
injunction? Galileo made a bad slip in replying. He should have said, "no, I

314
GALILEO
could not have done so even if I had thought it appropriate, since by then I
had long forgotten any such injunction, if, indeed, I had ever received one."
Instead he said: "I did not say anything to the Father Master of the Sacred
Palace about the above-mentioned injunction because I did not judge it neces­
sary to tell it to him, having no scruples since with the said book 1 had neither
held nor defended the opinion of the earth's motion and the sun's stability; on
the contrary, in the said book I show the contrary of Copernicus' opinion and
show that Copernicus' reasons are invalid and inconclusive.'?"
With this fib the examination of 12 April ended. Galileo, sworn to secrecy,
went to his comfortable rooms and Maculano retired to consider what
remained of his case."? The judgments of Oreggi and his fellow panelists,
submitted on the izth and accepted by the Congregation of the Holy Office
on the zrst, strengthened his hand. So did Galileo's cries of pain induced by
one or more of his ailments, which made a speedy settlement desirable for all
parties. Maculano asked for authorization to deal "extrajudicially with Gali­
leo to make him understand his error and, having recognized it, to bring him
to confess it." The cardinals of the congregation at first thought the proceed­
ing too bold (so Maculano wrote the cardinal nephew); but they authorized
it on learning the "basis" on which he would operate. What was the basis?
Perhaps a plea bargain? Galileo would confess to having gone too far, the
Holy Office would accept that his error was inadvertent, and some mild pen­
alty would be imposed. It would not be necessary to reconcile Bellarmine's
certificate and the injunction.è" There is not much evidence for this gentle­
men's agreement.
Maculano's letter to Cardinal Barberini motivated the extrajudicial pro­
ceeding as a way of saving Galileo from himself. If he were to maintain the
fib with which the first interrogation ended, "it would become necessary to
use greater rigor in the administration of justice and less regard for all the
ramifications of this business." The "basis" of Maculano's new strategy was
fear. Maculano might well have told Galileo that if he insisted on a battle of
wits and documents, the Holy Office would treat him as it did others who
waited their chance with the tribunal. He would exchange his comfortable
rooms for a jail cell for an indefinite period. People died in these unpleasant
places; witness the late abbot-astrologer Morandi and poor Archbishop de
Dominis. Furthermore, Maculano might have added, the Holy Father is still
very angry and there is no way that you can escape punishment. Would you
like it gentle or harsh? The choice was not difficult. Galileo agreed to confess

VAINGLORY
315
that he recognized that he had gone too far and repented doing so. This result,
Maculano hoped, would please the pope and everyone else. "The Tribune will
maintain its reputation [for always getting its man]; the culprit will be treated
with benignity; and, whatever the final outcome, he will know the favor done
to him." The inquisitors might be merciful. "[H]e could be granted imprison­
ment in his own house.'?"
On 30 April Galileo made his confession. He had reread his Dialogue, he
said, and examining it minutely, as if the work of someone else, he found
places in it where a reader ignorant of his intention might gather incorrectly
from the force of the reasons given that the Copernican view was true. The
arguments from sunspots and tides might be especially difficult to answer,
"[although] I inwardly and truly did and do hold them to be inconclusive
and refutable." Then comes something true: "[I yielded to] the natural grati­
fication everyone feels for his own subtleties and for showing himself to be
cleverer than the average man ... To use Cicero's words, 'I am more desirous
of glory than is suitable' ... My error then was, and I confess it, one of vain
ambition, pure ignorance, and inadvertence." And then a perfect piece of
Galilean impudence: to show his good faith and rhetorical skills, Galileo pro­
posed to add one or two more Days to the Dialogue, in which he would con­
fute the condemned opinion "in the most effective way that the blessed God
will enable me. So I beg this holy Tribunal to cooperate with me in this good
resolution, by granting me the permission to put it into practice.'?" He felt
in fine spirits, having had, he wrote Maria Celeste, "triumphant successes"
owing to her prayers and the Niccolinis' care. Maria Celeste perceived some­
thing else at work. "I implore you not to confuse yourself with drink.'?"
Ten days after this confession Galileo was allowed to make a statement
in his defense. It centered on the effacement of the memory of the injunc­
tion's fatal phrase ("in any way whatsoever") by Bellarrnine's protective cer­
tificate. Since Galileo did not think himself under an order stricter than the
published edict of the Index, whatever excesses he committed in the Dialogue
were not evidence of "the cunning of an insincere intention." They arose
rather through vain ambition, a fault, no doubt, but not a deceit. Please also
bear in mind (so Galileo ended his appeal to "the clemency and kindness
of heart" of his judges) my advanced age and pitiable state of health, and
the constant "slanders of those who hate me." Indeed it was to silence such
slanders that he had obtained his certificate from the Most Eminent Lord
Cardinal Bcllarrnine.w

GALILEO
The Congregation reported to Urban in Mayor early June. Their unfair
summary of the process included besides Calileo's depositions, the certifi­
cate, and the injunction, a résumé of Caccini's accusations, a few points from
the Letter to Christina, and a reference to the Copernican dicta in the Letters on
sunspots. This gave the impression that Galileo had been pushing a doctrine
contrary to scripture for two decades. In order to save the implausible argu­
ment of a plea bargain, this summary report has to be attributed to dishon­
est persons eager to see Galileo punished harshly; had it been drawn up
fairly, the argument continues, Urban would have been better advised and
the affair would have terminated more happily?" But Urban had no need of
a summary, biased or fair; he knew the salient facts and the necessary con­
clusions. On 16 June he ordered that Galileo be interrogated again as to his
motives and that if he answered satisfactorily he was to abjure ex vehementi
before the Congregation of the Holy Office, and thereafter be imprisoned at
the Inquisition's pleasure. And, of course, the Dialogue would be banned.:"
Abjuration ex vehementi, a process seldom undergone by laymen, was
required to clear the culprit from "vehement suspicion of heresy." Being
so suspected was itself a crime. The "trial" preceding abjuration sought to
persuade the accused to confess to the crime his judges had decided he had
committed. The procedure amounted to a public display of confession, con­
trition, and absolution. There was the sticky question, however, what heresy
Galileo may have held that had raised vehement suspicion in inquisitorial
minds. The process ex vehementi was not the only or the obvious punishment
for Galileo's offences. Indeed, it may have been the harshest punishment in
form (though not in its execution) to which Galileo could have been sub­
jected. Its purpose was to humiliate him."?
On 21 June, Galileo gave the necessary assurances. "I do not hold the
Copernican opinion and have not held it after being ordered by injunction
to abandon it." On the following day he heard his sentence before seven of
the ten cardinal-inquisitors. Among the missing was Francesco Barberini;
among those present, his brother Antonio and Guido Bentivoglio, a former
student of Calileo's who had remained well disposed toward him. The sen­
tence recapitulates the case as written up in the summary report, to which it
added that the Bellarmine certificate aggravated rather than ameliorated Gal­
ileo's situation since, "while it says that the said opinion is contrary to Holy
Scripture, yet you dared to treat of it, defend it, and show it as probable; nor
are you helped by the license you artfully and cunningly extorted since you

VAINGLORY
317
did not mention the injunction you were under." By these acts Galileo had
made himself "vehemently suspected of heresy, namely of having held and
believed a doctrine that is false and contrary to the divine and Holy Scrip­
ture." According to the canons and in the names of Jesus Christ and His Ever
Virgin Mother the cardinal-inquisitors were willing to absolve Galileo from
his pernicious error and transgressions if he first renounced them with a sin­
cere heart and unfeigned faith. To complete the business, they prohibited the
Dialogue, condemned Galileo to "formal imprisonment in this Holy Office at
our pleasure," and imposed on him the obligation to recite the seven peni­
tential psalms once a week for the next three years."!
It was time to recant. The ailing old man knelt down painfully before his
judges and twenty witnesses and read out, lighted candle in hand, the state­
ment prepared for him in the format for removing vehement suspicions:
I, Galileo Galilei ... kneeling before you Most Eminent and Most
Reverend Cardinals Inquisitors-General against heretical deprav­
ity in all of Christendom, having before my eyes and touching with
my hands the Holy Gospels, swear that I have always believed, and
believe now, and with God's help will believe in the future all that
the Holy and Apostolic Church holds, preaches, and teaches ... [D]
esiring to remove from the minds of Your Eminences and every faith­
ful Christian, this vehement suspicion, rightly conceived against me,
with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith I abjure, curse, and detest
the [Copernican] errors and heresies, and in general each and every
other error, heresy, and sect contrary ,to Holy Church; and I swear
that in the future I will never again say or assert, orally or in writing,
anything that might cause a similar suspicion about me ... So help me
God and these Holy Gospels.?"
Galileo rose without muttering eppur si muove ("still it moves") and returned,
shattered, to the Medici palace.

8.1 DRAMATlS PERSONAE
The minor characters
Several protagonists in the events of 1632/3 carried on the vendetta while
others retired to nurse their grievances. Chief among the ongoing duelists
was Inchofer, who toward the end of 1633 published a little book purport­
ing to prove that a stationary earth and a mobile sun were matters of faith.'
Its dedicatee was God Almighty; its authority, scripture and the Fathers;
its method, a jumble of formal logic, theological argot, and mathemati­
cal hocus pocus. For example, "it is a matter of faith that the heavens are
up and the earth is down," from which it follows that the sun cannot be at
the center or the earth above Venus. For if they were so placed, as Coper­
nieans require, how are we to understand how Christ descended into Hell
and rose to Heaven? However, false is not useless. The motions supposed
by Copernicus can be employed in calculations, and might even be useful
to the faith if mathematicians emphasized their falsity along with their util­
ity. Here Inchofer had in mind the minor truth later rediscovered by Karl
Popper: "mathematicians [should] ... work more and more toward trying to
falsify theories rather than to defend them." To this anticipation of modern
epistemology Inchofer added a pinch of ancient wisdom, Urban's Simple in
the words of the Preacher: "no man can find out the work that God maketh
from beginning to end.?

END GAMES
319
Then comes nastiness and nonsense. Mathematicians who play with phi­
losophy can become "wild and ridiculous," even heretical, if they claim the
truth of their hypothesis from its agreement with observation. Epicycles,
eccentrics, syzygies, zodiacal arcs, are just artifices, which become absurdi­
ties, indeed, monstrosities if applied on the assumption of a moving earth.
"If the translation of the earth were the sole cause of the motion of the sun
to the senses, and if the parallaxes are still the same when the earth is taken
to be at rest, then it follows in the given case that the earth both stands still
and moves ... "3 With even more powerful arguments Inchofer annihilated
the defenses that Copernican theory could not be heretical because Paul III
had sanctioned it and Pythagoras had received his version of it from Moses.
"False and disproven," "empty and foolish," "an imposture." Tycho's system
was just as good. "There is no need to invent any other theories that upset
the system of the universe, especially when they agree neither with true phi­
losophy nor with the sacred scriptures."
The Franciscan consultor who read Inchofer's manuscript for the Roman
censorship liked the message and the method. "[It] shows rightly that math­
ematics and the other human sciences should be subordinated to the rule
of sacred scripture, lest in our day there occur a dangerous detour into an
excessive freedom ... " Scheiner read it for the Jesuit censorship. He did not
like the message at all, since, in his opinion, the sun's motion and the earth's
rest were not matters of faith. 5 He soon had in hand his own anti -Copernican
exercise in response to a request from Urban for a short book against astrol­
ogy and the new astronomy," He worked at the agreeable task from 1632
until his death in 1650, nourishing his hatred for the "conceited and cunning
braggart" who had so grievously insulted him.' The book, which appeared
in 1651, charged Copernicus with dismissing the basis of sound philosophy
(sense perception) and the unanimous opinion of the Fathers, and Galileo
with starting errors and insults too numerous to itemize,"
Like Scheiner, Grassi left Rome in 1633, driven out, according to a good
story, because of his open advocacy of the cause of the Austrian Habsburgs.
It appears rather that he returned home to Savona to attend to his dying
father's affairs." During his time in Liguria, he designed churches and worked
on optics while the Jesuit generals-Vitelleschi's successors Vincenzo Car­
affa and Francesco Piccolomini-became more and more insistent on strict
adherence to Aristotle and St Thomas. That was a great blow to Grassi and
other mathematicians in the Society who recognized that some modern

320
GALILEO
discoveries made much of what they had to teach untenable. The Jesuit hier­
archy shut up Grassi more effectively than Urban silenced Galileo. "I see that
my work on colors can not be published because of the rigorous measures
of the last general congregation." The heavy-handed revisionists had prohib­
ited some opinions on which Grassi's treatise depended, "not because they
think them bad or false, but because they are new and out of the ordinary."
He would have to do what Galileo could not countenance. He would have to
sacrifice his book to Obedience, "by which no doubt I will gain more than I
would by bringing it out."!"
Riccardi managed to remain as Master of the Sacred Palace despite Macu­
lano's opinion or hope that he would be disciplined for his "inadvertence
and neglect in approving the [Dialogue]." He regained Urban's confidence by
continuing to portray himself as a victim of Ciampoli and Galileo; and per­
haps also by undertaking to refute Sarpi's repellent history of the Council
of Trent.'! He had been preternaturally ingenuous for a monster." But he
had recovered enough to be in line for a cardinal's hat when, in 1639, he was
called to a higher life, to the regret of many, including the Galileists, who did
not regard his actions in saving his skin as traitorous." Maculano succeeded
to the mastership and, in 1641, to the cardinalate. Oreggi received his reward
more quickly. Urban made his Bellarmine a cardinal shortly after the conclu­
sion of the trial.
Inchofer gave the funeral oration for Riccardi. The deceased Master, accord­
ing to the self-styled Sklavus, was as sensitive as a babe and as erudite as
Solomon. He wept like Job on any day he could not perform a scared rite. He
had no equal for knowledge of sciences, arts, languages, and literature, or for
strength of mind or tenacity of memory. "And for these accomplishments he
was so much admired that he bore, as an honor, the title of Monster.':" This
generous oration marked the height of Inchofer's prosperity. Soon his risky
writing and sneaky methods, as well as his closeness to the Vatican, gave wings
to Scheiner's negative opinion of him among his brethren. In return Inchofer
grew disenchanted with the Society. In January 1648 it brought him to trial for
contributing to an anti-Jesuit tract. In a bizarre replay of Calileo's ordeal he
confessed and in exchange received salutary penance and a sentence of indefi­
nite imprisonment. The term became definite nine months later when, on 28
September, Inchofer died in detention."
Although Urban had more important business than the aftermath of the
Galileo affair, he could not escape pestering and criticism arising from his

END GAMES
321
involvement in it. Both Galileo and Ciampoli continued to petition directly
and through others for relaxation of their sentences. Nonetheless, Ciampoli
stayed marooned in the Siberian Marche and Galileo in detention near Flor­
ence. Both turned to natural philosophy to pass the time." The flamboyant
Ciampoli projected a work in thirty volumes, or maybe sixty, providentially
cut short by his death in 1643. He left a prodigious quantity of manuscripts,
including four volumes on the history of Poland written for his patron King
Ladislav IV, and a number of essays uneasily combining Calileo's method
of reaching truth-sensible experience and necessary demonstration-with
Urban's teaching that the only accessible truth lies in revelation. From these
principles Ciampoli demonstrated in several ways that the marriage of Aris­
totle with the Bride of Christ, that fatal interdisciplinarity to which, among
other things, Galileo owed his fall, could produce only monsters." In pursu­
ing his new physics, Ciampoli had the help of a student of Castelli's, who
served as his secretary for several years between 1637 and 1641. Thus Evange­
lista Torricelli became the complete Galileist, combining, through his teach­
ers and patrons, the mathematical and literary sides of the master,"
Another reason-other than appeals for Galileo's release-that kept his
case before Urban was the Holy Office's incompetence. Perhaps even it did
not know what Calileo's condemnation had decided. Was Copernicanism a
heresy or not? Did the proscription against teaching it apply only to Gali­
leo? The uncertainty suggests a difference of opinion among Galileo's judges
over the nature and severity of his crime. A recent retelling makes the trial
a struggle between a lenient party (Francesco Barberini, Maculano, Ben­
tivoglio) and a severe one (Urban, Oreggi, Inchofer). They compromised on
the charge of "vehement suspicion of heresy" without specifying the heresy
suspected." Whether or not this was the origin of the awkward charge, the
consequent confusion became manifest when the papal nuncios, obedient
to Urban's orders, distributed copies of Galileo's sentence and abjuration to
mathematicians within their jurisdictions. Some fifty of these dangerous cal­
culators, as many as the Inquisition could round up, assembled in Florence
to hear the official documents read to them." Some of the nuncios did their
duty zealously, others more languidly, but none could say for certain what
the documents, which, as handwritten copies, differed somewhat among
themselves, signified."
The decisions of 1616, which framed the "trial" of 1633, had not been clear
either. As we know, they consisted of the secret finding by the Holy Office

322
GALILEO
that a moving sun was "formally heretical because contrary to scripture" and
the published prohibition by the Index of Copernican books without men­
tion of heresy. Galileo's semi-private interview with Bellarmine, whether or
not it ended in the injunction or precept from Seghizzi, went no further: he
learned that his view of the universe was contra scripturam, not that it had been
declared heretical. As the omission of "formally heretical" from the Index's
version shows, a finding contra scripturam, which could be made by the tribu­
nal, did not mean "heretical," a determination that could be made only by a
pope or general council. 22 What then was the heresy of which Galileo was
vehemently suspected?
In his abjuration, Galileo itemized the acts that had troubled his judges:
disobeying the precept, defending a false doctrine already condemned as
contrary to scripture, and writing and publishing a book giving strong rea­
sons in its favor without refuting them. "Therefore I have been vehemently
suspected of heresy, namely, of having held and believed that the sun is the
center of the world and motionless ... " The tribunal used the same phrase
in its sentence of Galileo; but even this formulation seems only to say that
the suspicion arose because he clung to a doctrine he had been told con­
tradicted scripture, not to a proposition that a competent authority had
declared heretical. Continuing his recantation in the standard. formula for
abjuration ex vehementi, Galileo had to "abjure, curse, and detest the above-men­
tioned errors and heresies, and, in general, each and every other error, heresy,
and sect contrary to the Holy Church." It appears that the first official public
identification of Copernicanism as a heresy came in the curious and irregu­
lar form of a pronouncement not by a pope or a council but by a layman!
Since Galileo's recantation had the enthusiastic but silent support of Urban,
it has been construed as sufficient to make condemnation of Copernican­
ism a matter of faith. On this interpretation, Galileo would have announced
a newly defined heresy and sworn that the Inquisitors erred in thinking he
held it in the same breath. It seems safer to say that Galileo's abjuration fol­
lowed the standard form where inappropriate, and Copernicanism became a
heresy not by papal edict but by poor editing."
It was not hard to fall under vehement suspicion of heresy without
being supposed to hold one. The Inquisition needed only to notice that a
suspect held the beliefs, and behaved in ways, that in its experience often
led to heresy. Sample offences were hindering the work of the Inquisition;
favoring, defending, advising, or receiving heretics; and denying openly

END GAMES
323
well-known tenets of faith. Calileo's violation of the admonition and pre­
cept, his sleight-of-hand with the imprimatur, and his vigorous defense of a
condemned opinion would qualify him as a suspect under this head. There
is another way that he might have been deemed suspect although the belief
that gave rise to the suspicion was not a heresy. Inquisitors seem sometimes
to have applied (or misapplied) the term "heretical" to rebellious, licentious,
or impious talk and acts that showed an inclination to one heresy or anoth­
er." Galileo's disobedience might have qualified under this generous defini­
tion. We remember Sarpi's observation that the Roman hierarchy made a
habit of crying "heretical" against ideas and behavior it did not like.
In this confusion the nuncios could agree how to threaten but not how to
advise. Those who thought they could read Urban's mind inferred that he had
determined Copernicanism to be a heresy. Others could suppose that with
progress in physics and exegesis the condemned view might be safely held;
the finding contra scripturam, contrary to one of heresy, was amendable. The
nuncio to Venice allowed himself to characterize both Galilee's views and
those of Holy Writ as opinions." We know that neither Grassi nor Scheiner
believed that heliocentrism was, or had been declared, a heresy. The initial
perplexity of Descartes and his manner of resolving it may be representative
of temperate Catholics outside the Roman hothouse. At first he thought to
burn or hide the manuscript in which he had developed his version of the
banned system. It then occurred to him that since neither pope nor council
had condemned Copernicanism, it was not a heresy or a matter of faith. "It
might turn out as it did for [belief in] the antipodes, which once was con­
demned in almost the same way ... "26 Mathematicians within the reach of
Rome censored themselves and characterized the Copernican system as a
hypothesis or supposition if they discussed it at all. Only Galileo suffered for
teaching and defending it.
The circumstances of Galileo's challenge to the church-his zeal in push­
ing a doctrine declared to be contrary to scripture, his invention of a herme­
neutics to undermine constituted authority in biblical interpretation, his
outspoken disdain for people who disagreed with him, and his treatment of
Urban's voluntarism-would seem sufficient reasons for his downfall. Some
historians add Spanish pressure on Urban, which, they suppose, he thought
he could reduce by demonstrating his vigilance against Calileo's "heresy."
They are off by several orders of magnitude. The Spanish faction demanded
that Urban intervene vigorously, that is, financially, on the Habsburg side in

324
GALILEO
the ongoing war and that he reverse his reversal of the policy of three genera­
tions of his predecessors, who had encouraged the growth of Spanish influ­
ence in Rome. Galileo had no value as a trophy in this high-stakes political
game. His condemnation made no difference to Urban's expressions of parti­
ality for the French, which occasionally precipitated armed conflict between
Frenchmen and Spaniards in the streets of Rome. When Urban fell seriously
ill in 1637, Spanish troops mobilized on the Neapolitan border to insure a
friendlier successor. Knowing that the sacrifice of Galileo could not appease
Spain, the Barberinis barricaded themselves in Castel Sant' Angelo to weather
the interregnum they feared, having first stripped the Vatican of the furnish­
ings they fancied."
Urban lived to continue to favor France and tether Galileo. Several influ­
ential French Catholics pleaded for Galileo's release, notably Fabri de Peiresc,
who squandered in the cause the entire capital of good will he had acquired
by publishing Urban's poems." In a routine case he would have succeeded.
Customarily people who had abjured ex vehementi stayed for a time in jail
and then in a monastery, after which, on application, they obtained their
freedom. Campanella underwent exactly that course of rehabilitation in the
1590S. "Perpetual incarceration" in inquisitorial practice meant detention for
three to eight years." The Holy Office maintained its clampdown on Galileo,
which included monitoring his visitors, because Urban continued to regard
him as a clear and present danger. That was as great a compliment to the
power of Galileo's words as to the perniciousness of his philosophy.
Castelli did not compromise himself during Galileo's trial. He spent the
time in Brescia, sent there, some say, by a caring pope, to keep him from
acting rashly, or, others say, drawn there to liberate his brother from jail with
the help of the sympathetic cardinal nephew. The Barberinis' solicitude did
not extend to allowing Castelli to return to the chair of mathematics at the
University of Pisa offered him after Aggiunti's death in 1635. That would
have brought him too close to Galileo. Instead, Castelli received the largely
pro-forma charge of a Benedictine abbey in the Veneto to help him meet his
expenses in Rome, which included outlays for good wine and the tobacco he
recommended to Galileo as a cure for everything."
Castelli's ongoing service as "mathematician to Pope Urban VIII and pro­
fessor at the University of Rome" dealt with such enduring problems as
controlling the River Reno and draining the Pontine Marshes. His advice
concerning a proposal to straighten a part of the river Bisenzio, a tributary

of the Arno, is worth recalling. Castelli, Guiducci, and other Galileists famil­
iar with Galileo's unpublished ideas about motion on inclined planes argued
that the cut would not improve the flow because change in elevation, not
length of channel, determined change in velocity. The projectors replied that
the longer and sharper the meanders, the greater the friction and the slower
the flow. When consulted, Galileo affirmed that a flowing river behaves like a
cascade of balls down an inclined plane (water particles do not cohere!); since
the length of the river bed, like that of the plane, makes no difference, the
proposed cut would have no benefit. This analysis omits the most important
factor in the calculation: Guiducci owned land along the Bisenzio threatened
by the engineering works." The episode displays to advantage the solidarity,
rather than the science, of Calileo's disciples. Throughout his employment
by the Barberini, Castelli remained fiercely loyal to Galileo."
The main actor
Picking himself up from his humiliating posture before the cardinals and
the gospels, Galileo returned to Niccolini's residence while awaiting Urban's
decision about his place of detention. On 30 June 1633, after an appeal to his
former friend, he received permission to stay within the palace of the arch­
bishop of Siena, Ascanio Piccolomini, in anticipation of a return to Florence.
This last step, conceded by the pope in December, brought Galileo back home
to Arcetri after an absence of over a year. The main condition placed upon
him apart from not leaving was to keep at bay people eager to discuss world
systems. Above aU, he could not make his house a meeting place for a society
of philosophers and mathematicians. B
The six months that Galileo spent in Siena at Piccolornini's house and
table revived his spirits. He started a new work on mechanics-s'full of many
curious and useful ideas"-and enjoyed the conversation of the archbishop.
Among the subjects discussed was astrology. Piccolornini's elder brother
Ottavio had asked him to supply a certain birth chart. The archbishop
could not obtain it from Sienese astrologers, whom Urban's bull had driven
underground. Fortunately, so Ascanio replied to Ottavio, he had an accom­
plished astrologer as a guest. "I have largely lost credence [in the art] since
learning that Messr Galileo, famed as an Astrologer ... derides it entirely, and
makes fun of it as a profession founded on the most uncertain, if not false.
foundations.'?' That was not what Ottavio wanted to hear.

326
GALILEO
Ottavio Piccolomini was the unscrupulous lieutenant of the imperial gen­
eral Albrecht von Wallenstein, who went nowhere without his astrologers.
For a time beginning in 1628 this baggage included Kepler, driven from Prague
by imperial stinginess and religious persecution. Kepler knew the details of
Wallenstein's geniture peculiarly well. He had drawn it up in 1608, and, at the
general's request, had updated it in 1624 with the prediction that a horrible
tragedy would strike Wallenstein in February 1634. Kepler did not have the
satisfaction of seeing his prediction realized. Not because it did not happen
as he had foreseen, but because he died in 1630. Piccolomini, who knew about
it, and knew further that Wallenstein believed it, led a plot against his fear­
some leader. Naturally it unfolded in February 1634, when the general had
fallen from favor and the stars assured success. Piccolomini did well from his
collaboration with fate and ended the Thirty Years War in command of the
imperial forces."
The report of the archbishop to the general probably accurately repro­
duced Calileo's final considered opinion about astrology. He had placed
some credence in it when he cast birth charts for himself, his daughters, and
his students, and sought to reassure astrologers that the discovery of the
moons of Jupiter did not make their art any less reliable than it had been."
But experience had exposed its shortcomings (his calculation of Virginia's
character suited Livia's better, and vice versa), the Morandi affair its dangers,
and the Bull Inscrutabilis its illegality. "It would be very remarkable if [anyone]
managed to place astrology at the top of human sciences," so Galileo wrote
Diodati as he set forth for Rome in 1633. Or rather, as he put the point to
Archbishop Piccolomini later in the year, astrology was almost certainly
false." Another possible reason for Galileo's cooling toward the art is that it
did not fit with his tidal theory. According to a strong traditional plausibil­
ity argument, planets exercise physical influences here below just as the sun
has jurisdiction most evidently over the seasons and the moon less evidently
over the waters. Galileo denied the middle term, the lunar influence, as part
of his kinematical clean-up of the Aristotelian heavens and the spooky quali­
tative cosmic magnetic forces invoked by Kepler.
The free conversation at the archbishop's table gave rise to the accusation
that he allowed his infamous guest to introduce dangerous ideas into sus­
ceptible minds. The local inquisitors learned that Galileo spread "opinions
hardly Catholic" with the support of Archbishop Piccolomini, "who has told
many here that Galileo was unjustly treated by the Sacred Congregation and

END GAMES
327
that he could not and should not reprove philosophical opinions that he had
sustained with true and invincible mathematical reasons, and that he is the
greatest man in the world and will live forever in his writings, and that he is
followed by all the best modern minds."�8 All of which was brave and true.
The fine story that when rising from his knees before the inquisition Galileo
muttered, "still it moves," is associated with the Piccolomini. A portrait, rep­
resenting the scene of Calileo's recantation, perhaps by Murillo and perhaps
commissioned by General Ottavio, displays the slogan, eppur si muove. �9
Despite the silk hangings and rieh furnishings of his apartment, Galileo
longed to return to Florence and, as he fancied, the grand duke's service.
He urged Cioli to ask Ferdinando II to ask the pope for his release, "and, to
give the petition more force, he might adduce the loss of my services over so
long a time, exaggerating their value somewhat over their true worth." The
ambassador, the knowledgeable Niccolini, judged that Urban was still too
angry to approach." Galileo had therefore to continue to operate in Flor­
ence at a distance, primarily through Maria Celeste, who with the help of
Guiducci and Bocchineri had attended to Calileo's business during his con­
finement in Rome. It took some effort to run Arcetri with its servants, dove­
cote, orange trees, vegetable garden, grape vines, and "most original mule.":"
Maria Celeste managed well, let the house, sold the surplus crops, and made
a profit that she shared with her sister. She managed even to sell a year's
supply of spoiling wine. Meanwhile Galileo was enjoying premium wine
at the archbishop's table. Maria Celeste: "I pray that you continue [in good
health] by governing yourself well particularly with regard to the drinking
that is so hurtful to you, for I fear that ... your social obligations to your host
afford you ample opportunity for indulging.':" But in Christian charity she
responded to Calileo's worry that Arcetri would be dry on his arrival. The
good angel ordered in a goodly supply, three mule loads at one go; and, in
her last recorded service to her father, could announce, on 10 December, that
"the casks for the white wine are all in order.":"
Maria Celeste did not neglect the spiritual comfort of her psychologically
labile father. After learning his sentence she wrote, "Now is the time to avail
yourself more than ever of the prudence [!] which the Lord God has granted
you, bearing these blows with that strength of spirit which your religion,
your profession, and your age require. And since you, by virtue of your vast
experience, can lay claim to full cognizance of the fallacy and instability of
everything in this miserable world, you must not make too much of these

GAll LEO
storms." Galileo smiled and made the best of things, to his daughter anyway,
by allowing, no doubt with some reservations, that his travail had ended
"to the satisfaction of both [himself] and [his] adversaries.'?" Maria Celeste
proposed to free her father by mobilizing women-good Mrs Niccolini and
Mrs Barberini, the mother of the cardinal nephew, and all the nuns of San
Matteo, who would pray to God to enlighten his Vicar. The method did not
procure Galileo's release but may have been responsible for his unusual run
of good health." More practically, the innocent nun allowed Bocchineri and
the professor of mathematics at Pisa, Niccolo Aggiunti, to remove all the
manuscripts from Galileo's house in which the Inquisition might find any­
thing compromising."
Despite her incarceration, Maria Celeste kept Galileo's family together.
She persuaded him to help enlarge her brother Vincenzo's house in Costa
San Giorgio between Florence and Arcetri, which would be a refuge for him
when ill; she succored the ingrate Vincenzo Landucci, left in a pitiable state
with two children when the plague took his wife; and she urged Galileo to
other good works, like helping the relatives of his mother." Perhaps Galileo
took the many services his daughter rendered too much for granted. In reply
to his complaint that she had neglected her weekly letter, she flared out: "If
only you were able to fathom my soul and its longing the way you penetrate
the Heavens, Sire, I feel certain you would not complain of me." Galileo
loved Maria Celeste as much as he could anyone. He was devastated when,
three months after he returned to Arcetri, her longing soul fled the prison to
which he had consigned it."
Maria Celeste's death coincided with a hardening of the conditions of
Galileo's detention. He described them to Diodati:"
I am restricted to this little villa a mile from Florence with the strict­
est prohibition against going there and against having meetings with
many friends together ... So I live quietly frequently visiting a nearby
convent where I had two daughters whom I much loved, especially
the elder, a woman of fine mind and singular goodness and most
affectionate to me ... Returning home [the day before she died]
I found a deputy of the Inquisitor come to tell me of an order from
the Holy Office in Rome ... that I must stop asking for permission to
return to Florence or they will make me return to a real prison of the
Inquisition. From this and other incidents ... you see that the rage of
my most powerful persecutors is continually aggravated.

He could do nothing but fulfill at last the purpose for which his friends
thought him uniquely suited. "God willing, I want to publish my books on
motion and other works, all entirely new ... "50
8.2 WINDING UP
When on his knees before the Inquisition, Galileo had sworn not to say or
write anything about a moving earth or stationary sun, "et contra," lest he
fall again under suspicion of heresy. Presumably "et contra" meant that he
could not write against Copernicanism either, a measure directed, perhaps,
against his proposal to add two more days to the Dialogue to refute the argu­
ments of the previous four. He was not required to remain silent about other
matters, however, and he began to plan his long-delayed work on mechan­
ics while still enjoying Piccolomini's hospitality in Siena. He continued with
this work, encouraged by friends and notwithstanding the loss of some
of his manuscripts during their precautionary removal from his house by
Bocchineri and Aggiunti. He planned to publish the resulting dialogues with
appropriate license in Venice through the good offices of his old friend Ful­
genzio Micanzio." The plan snagged on Micanzio's discovery of a miserable
example of Roman malignity. He asked the Inquisitor of Venice for a license
to republish Galileo's Dialogue on floating bodies. The inquisitor refused. He
had received an order from Rome. Micanzio replied that the order had to do
with the Copernican system. "No," he replied, "it is a general prohibition de
editis omnibus et edendis," against everything Galileo had published and wanted
to publish. Micanzio was outraged at this effort to deprive posterity of "the
greatest progress in philosophy that had been made in two thousand years."
It would be a "crime against humanity."?
Micanzio could estimate what posterity would lose since he had received
drafts of Calileo's new work before visiting the inquisitor. Micanzio expressed
his admiration in the style of a character in a Galilean dialogue. "It is inex­
plicable how in everyday trivial things known to everyone you observe
the effects of nature and rise to the deepest thoughts ... The novelty of the
things, the reasoning and demonstrations put me into a new world ... " "I
cannot admire enough how the book of nature is so fully open to your mind
that you find the most profound and undetected marvels in everything."
"Our good old master Fra Paolo [was right in saying] that God and nature

330
GALILEO
had made your intellect unique in all time for understanding motion, and
that what did not occur to you [ about it] was beyond the reach of human
thought."? As Micanzio fretted how to print the great work in Italy, Dio­
dati was busy beyond the Alps sponsoring a Latin edition of the Dialogue.
He chose a Lutheran professor of history as translator. This was Kepler's
great friend Matthias Bernegger, who had rendered Galileo's booklet on the
compass into Latin. The demanding new task allowed him simultaneously
to enlighten posterity and embarrass Rome. "You see [Bernegger wrote a
fellow Lutheran and Keplerian] to what stupidity those purple-coated priests
have come. Let's not allow them to deprive the public of such a book." The
Elsevier Press in Strasbourg delivered Bernegger's version of the Dialogue,
entitled Systema cosmicum, in 1635. The volume also contained Foscarini's con­
demned hermeneutics, and, almost, Galileo's then still unpublished letter to
Christina, which had to be issued separately because Diodati's Latin transla­
tion missed the printing deadline. 54
The published Letter to Christina carried a preface defending Galileo assem­
bled by Diodati from excerpts from Calileo's letters. It blamed everything on
rabid, relentless, and, except for the Jesuits, anonymous enemies. What had
hurt Galileo most, so he had written Fabri de Peiresc and Diodati, and so Dio­
dati wrote in his preface, was the slander that he was not a good Catholic. "Many
might have been able to behave and speak in a much more learned manner,
but no one, not even among the Holy Fathers, would have been able to do so
with more piety or with a greater zeal for the Holy Church, or ultimately with
a holier intention than mine ... In reading all my works, no one will find even
the smallest shadow of anything straying from piety and reverence toward the
Holy Church." Perhaps a strict interpreter might spy a lapse of piety or zeal in
Galileo's collaboration in the publication of the Letter to Christina, since he sup­
plied the manuscript and also commented on Diodati's draft preface. He may
have felt the risk of further dealings with the Holy Office worth running not
only because publication of the preface and the Letter would put his case before
the Republic of Letters, but also because he believed that his essay in theology
might convince Rome to relax the conditions of his detention."
The obvious publisher for Galileo's "Dialogues on motion," as he referred
in correspondence to the "fruits of my studies I value the most," was Else­
vier." The route was circuitous. Galileo had sent copies of the manuscript,
completed in 1636, to several sets of friends. One came into the hands of Gio­
vanni Pieroni, who served the Holy Roman Emperor and saw no problem in

END GAMES
331
publishing in Prague. Jesuit influence ruled out Vienna and, as Pieroni discov­
ered, Prague too. He therefore proposed to acquire a press to print Calileo's
work, "which is equally beautiful and novel, as marvelous as it is certain."
The Cardinal Bishop of Olmütz had a press, and seemed willing to print; the
figures were almost finished; but, in the end, Pieroni could not overcome the
obstacles and had to return the manuscript. "What an unhappy place we live
in, where there reigns a determined resolution to exterminate all novelties,
especially in science, as if we already knew everything knowable'?" Thus
Galileo, growing impatient and fearful that in the end his enemies would
succeed in silencing him.
The obvious solution then appeared in the form of Louis Elsevier, who
obtained a copy of the manuscript through Mincanzio during an extended
visit to Venice. Another copy went north directly in the baggage of the
French ambassador to Rome, the Comte de Noailles, who had been Gali­
leo's student in Padua in 1603. Having finished his embassy in Rome, Noailles
obtained from Urban, who could not refuse a high French diplomat a rea­
sonable request, permission for Galileo to meet him along his route back to
France in 1636.58 The manuscript he then obtained also reached the Elsevi­
ers, who issued Galileo's favorite work from their Leyden press in 1638 as
Discourses on two new sciences. The title diminished Calileo's satisfaction in the
book. He thought it plebian, vulgar, and unimaginative in comparison with
"Dialogues on motion."?
Galileo dedicated Two new sciences to Noailles with an open appeal for
protection. "If I may be permitted to say so, you are now obliged to defend
my reputation against anyone who attacks it, you having entered me in the
lists against all adversaries." Orlando had found his Charlemagne, and a
more promising field for the celebration of his deeds, in the vast open tracts
beyond the Alps. The narrow arena defined by Florence and Rome, in which
he had tried universal truths against parochial interests, now appeared in its
true measure. Failure among the priests and prelates of Italy might be a rec­
ommendation elsewhere. Regarded from Paris, Noailles wrote, "you are the
greatest mind in Italy.'?" Galileo thought so too. In the preface to Two new sci­
ences, written by him but signed by the printer, we read that "wise antiquity"
honored its great inventors and light-bringers, "even to the point of making
them gods." Galileo is such a light-bringer, the greatest in our time; in the
present work, dear reader, you will find abundant evidence of "the grace con­
ceded to this man by God and nature."?'

332
GALILEO
Days 1 and 2
The Two new sciences develop in conversation among Salviati, Sagredo, and
Simplicio, who have moved from Sagredo's airy palace and world systems
to the Venetian Arsenal and down-to-earth machinery. The discussion
opens with a complaint by Sagredo: despite his best efforts, he has not been
able to make workmen understand that if a wooden beam of given length
and cross-section can support a weight w, a similar beam with dimensions
increased ten-fold should be able to support a weight lOW. The workman
was right, Salviati replies, and claims to be able to show geometrically the
relative weakness of bigger structures scaled up from smaller ones. Consider
only that a child can sustain a drop that would break the bones of an adult;
that a cat can fall further than the child without injury; that a cricket might
survive a plunge from a tower and an ant one from the moon. A giant sixty
feet tall could scarcely stand if his bones were only ten times thicker than
those of ordinary men.?
What then causes resistance to breakage? In a wooden beam the case is
clear: fibers, as in a rope. What about stone or metal? Salviati remarks that
two flat, highly polished pieces of marble will adhere when their smooth
surfaces are pressed together, and asks whether nature's reluctance to admit
a void (the cause offered for the adherence of the marbles) can explain the
coherence of bodies? To settle the question, Salviati adduces Galileo's dem­
onstration that water has no force of aggregation among its parts. If it were
only possible to make a rope of water and hang a weight from it! Nothing
easier, says Sagredo, the experiment takes place every day: suction pumps
can raise water only thirty feet or so before the water column breaks under
its own weight. Since by hypothesis water contains no glue, a column of
it thirty feet high, independent of cross-section, must measure nature's
abhorrence of a vacuum. Now a stone pillar heavier than a thirty-foot water
column of the same cross-section can sustain itself. It appears that some­
thing other than fear of the vacuum holds the world together."
Sagredo suggests and Salviati agrees that the conclusion is precipitous. Per­
haps the force at play is not resistance to a measurable void, like that supposedly
created in the instant of separation of polished marble slabs, but resistance to
exposing the infinity of infinitesimal voids that might exist between the infinity
of infinitesimal particles that might constitute the surface of the stones. Sim­
plicio interjects that the idea smacks of the teaching of atomists. Sagredo: "At

END GAMES
333
least you did not add, 'who denied Divine Providence,' as in a similar instance a
certain antagonist of our Academician very inappropriately did add." Even Sim­
plicio has no time for this antagonist (Sarsi). "Indeed I perceived, not without
disgust, the hatred in that malicious opponent ... I know how far such ideas are
from the temperate and orderly mind of such a man as you [Salviati], who are
not only religious and pious, but Catholic and devout." With this thin protection,
the friends go for a random walk through the vacuum, through "many intricate
labyrinths," where the paradoxes of the infinite and the infinitesimal greet them
at every turn. From all of which it followed that the rim of a disk is made up of
an infinite number of matter bits and infinitely divided nothingness."
This bizarre picture resulted from an analysis of a famous problem in
Aristotle's Mechanica. A rolling wheel advances along the ground a dis­
tance equal to its circumference during each rotation. Its hub during the
same rotation lays down a smaller circumference along a line parallel to
the ground (Figure 8.1). Yet they return to the same configuration. Thus the
successive points C appear to skip forward (the successive points A being at
rest). Or, if the rotation occurs so that C is instantaneously at rest (CA being
free to move in a ditch), the successive points A would appear to skip back­
ward. The skipping arises when material points come opposite infinitesimal
voids. It was this argument that had unleashed Micanzio's excitement over
Two new sciences since it revealed the mechanism of contraction and dila­
tion (without removal or addition of material) that he, Sarpi, and Galileo
had puzzled over in the old Paduan days." Sarpi's position as preserved in
his notebooks does indicate puzzlement. "Rarefaction and condensation
will be a sort of configuration of the plenum and vacuum, condensation by
expelling the alieno, rarefaction by admitting it." Fra Paolo had not identi­
fied the "alien" in question." Galileo kept at the puzzle until one morning
at breakfast at the real Salviati's he saw how nature could condense and
expand bodies without requiring void space or bodily interpenetration. The
theory as sketched in the Dialogue exploits the infinity of infinitesimal voids
scattered among the infinity of matter points that together formed bodies.
A moving together of the points produced condensation, the opposite
motion expansion. In keeping with his kinematical approach, neither here
nor in his account of the strength of materials did Galileo specify forces that
could push mass points in and out of their microvoids. Simplicio noticed
that there was too much geometry and too little physics in Salviati's phi­
losophy, but had no idea how to repair it."

FIG. 8.1 Aristotle's wheel, which presents several puzzles of the infinite.
Salviati turned to exploding Aristotle's theory of the void with the
arguments Galileo had developed by 1610: velocity of fall independent of
weight, Archimedean buoyancy, descent along inclined planes, and pendu­
lum swings strictly isochronous irrespective of amplitude. From pendular
vibrations Salviati sublimed to music, to Vincenzo Calilei's experiments on
monochords, once more avoiding dynamics in favor of arithmetic. Since a
string's pitch depends on its thickness and tension as well as on its length,
none of these physical qualities can be "the direct and immediate reason
behind the forms of musical intervals"; the reason must be sought, rather,
in "the ratio of the numbers of vibrations and impacts of airwaves that go
to strike our eardrum." Sagredo explains why the "direct and immediate"
cause, 5:3, gives us such pleasure before noticing that the day has gone in
digressions." Still, it had been worthwhile to hear Salviati's "delicate and
wonderful," "subtle ... novel ... remarkable ... ingenious," speculations. Sal­
viati promised to return on the morrow, "to serve and please yoU."69
When the friends meet again they are all business. Salviati has cast his ideas
about the strength of materials into propositions and corollaries couched
in geometry. His basic idea is that the equilibrium of a horizontal wooden
beam may be likened to the operation of a bent lever. Neglect at first the
weight of the beam and ascribe its resistance to a large number of "threads"
parallel to its axis each under tension T. We can suppose (incorrectly as it
happens) that these fibers all act at the center of the base AC (Figure 8.2),
so that the total power of resistance R to the pull of W is proportional to
a2T. To keep the beam from breaking, the clamped portion must pull to the
left on the lever arm CA with the moment Ra12. The law of the lever then

gives Proposition 1, R:W = 2b:a. Propositions 2-4 bring nothing new except
a catchy corollary: "the moments of resistances of prisms and cylinders of
equal length are as the three-halves power of their volumes.":"
Then come a few propositions bearing on the original problem of scal­
ing. Salviati compares two geometrically similar beams made of the same
material each bearing only its own weight. Let the dimensions be a,b and c,d,
where a:b = c:d, and let the larger weigh k times the smaller. Then c = k1f3a, d =
klPb. The area of the base and hence its resistance R increase as Pp. Therefore
the weight, which increases by k, goes up as R3/2, or, as Salviati puts it, with
moment M for weight, Ml :M2 = (RI :R2) 3/2.71 Simplicio: "This proposition strikes
me as not only new but surprising, and at first glance very remote from the
judgment I had originally formed." For it showed that the resistance of a beam
to fracture does not increase linearly with its weight, but at a higher power.
Sagredo: "This demonstrates the proposition which, as I said at the beginning
of our discussion [after Salviati corrected me], seemed then to reveal itself to
me through shadows."?
Salviati shows that for a given ratio a:b there is only one prism at the edge
of breaking under its own weight; a longer one would fail, a shorter one could
carry an additional load. Two nice departures from this line of reasoning mark
the end of the day. Sagredo observes that material might probably be removed
from a prismatic beam without lessening its resistance or shortening its length.
"Without lessening resistance" signifies that the carved beam is no more likely

to break transversely at one point than at another. Assume that the beam
weighs nothing and that the shape required is the unknown curve in Figure 8.3.
The moment bW balances the moment of resistance at FA, which is propor­
tional to a3• Can it also be made to balance the resistance proportional to c2a
exercised by the base CD? (The dimension of both bases perpendicular to the
plane FABG is a.) That would require a21b = c2ld. A curve satisfying this property
for all points D along it is a parabola. Salviati shows off by demonstrating that
its volume is only two-thirds that of the prism ABGF. "A beautiful and ingen­
ious demonstration" (Sagredo), and quite a saving in weightless wood!"
The second refreshing departure explains the cleverness of birds and
plants in employing hollow cylinders to strengthen their bones and stalks
with little expenditure in mass. A hollow tube made of the same amount of
material as a solid one can be considerably stronger. Let them have the same
length and external diameters a and b. Then since the base of the tube and of
the rod anchor the same number of fibers (they contain equal matter) their
moments of resistance are as their lever arms, that is, as a:b.74 (In Salviati's
approximations, the average lever arm of the base of the tube is bI2.) With
this contribution to bird economy the second day ends, without as much as a
Nunc dimittis, perhaps because Galileo had intended to continue it before the
Elseviers concluded the discussion by publishing it.
Day 3
Without a word of greeting, Salviati begins the third day's conversation by read­
ing aloud in Latin from Calileo's perfected treatise on motion. It is a very fine
book, filled with clever theorems, a basic text for students of mechanics, but

END GAMES
337
also tedious, repetitive, and, because Galileo stuck with the ancient style of geo­
metrical presentation, inefficient. What life it has comes from interruptions in
Italian when Sagredo or Simplicio requires fuller explanations. Sagredo is the
first to interject. He does not like Galilee's definition of uniformly accelerated
motion as "add[ing] on to itself equal momenta of swiftness in equal times." He
offers two objections: since time is indefinitely divisible, the falling body would
have to move through every degree of slowness before attaining any discerna­
ble speed; and the proposition that velocity increases in proportion to distance
fallen would do as well or better than Calileo's definition. Salviati replies that
he too had trouble with these obstacles as had the Academician himself, but
that with a little attention they disappear. The falling body does go through all
degrees of tardiness, but spends no finite time in any of them; and an object
whose velocity increases with distance would have to cover any space assigned
in the same time. Whence Salviati made a sociological deduction: since Gali­
leo's demonstrations are so clear and effective, his adversaries must understand
them too, and suppress them "merely to keep down the reputations of other
men in the estimation of the common herd of little understanding.'?'
Salviati resumes his reading. The material is familiar: velocity acquired in
descending along an inclined plane depends on the vertical drop, not the slope;
successive intervals traversed in free fall from rest increase as successive odd
numbers and, consequently, total distances as the squares of the time elapsed.
Simplicio breaks in to declare a preference for the arithmetic formulation (the
odd-number rule), which he fully understands, over Galileo's geometrical one
(areas of triangles), which gives him trouble; and he demands some experi­
mental evidence to anchor the theory before the reading continues. Salviati
obliges with a detailed description of trials made by the Academician in his
presence. They had taken a smooth, straight board, rabbeted out a groove or
channel down its length, lined the channel with smooth vellum, rolled a hard
bronze ball down it from different places, and timed the rolls with a water
clock. In a hundred trials, so Salviati affirmed, the rule of fall-distance rolled
proportional to the square of time elapsed-held "to within a pulse beat."?
The ground being thus prepared, Salviati reads off a series of propositions
about broken journeys along inclined planes, alL requiring the proposition
that acceleration along an incline of height a and length b is weaker than
acceleration in free fall by the factor alb. Apparently Galileo decided that this
capital proposition required stronger arguments than Salviati's assertion and
in 1638, too late for publication then, he added a strong argument included in

GALILEO
later editions. This begins with the observation that the tendency of motior
down an inclined plane declines with its slope, becoming zero on a horizon
tal surface, where it has no tendency to move up or down. The argurnen
continues, in a gratuitous but precious deduction irrelevant to the proof, tha
motion in the horizontal, "which here means a surface equidistant from th
center [of the earth J," would, if once started, continue indefinitely. It appean
therefore, that in his last formal analysis of motion, Galileo saw no point il
considering a moving body not constrained by a center.
The problem under consideration concerns planes of finite slope. Calile:
resolves it by an application of the law of the lever. In Figure 8.4, the weight
being in equilibrium, A <B, the downward moment of A is equilibrated b:
that of B, only part of which acts vertically. This portion is (alb) since, if j
sinks by an amount x, then B, constrained by the plane and the string, wil
rise only by y, which geometry requires to equal (alb )x: as usual in machines
the smaller weight moves through a greater distance to raise a larger weigh
a smaller distance. The law of the lever tells us that the weights are in invers
proportion to the distances: B = (bla)A; or, taking the pulley as the fulcrum
that the moment of B along the plane is (alb)B. From which it follows­
Salviati here returns to the text of 1636-that the times of descent along plane.
of unequal length but the same height are as the lengths. Sagredo remark
that Salviati need not have troubled to prove it, since he had already prove<
(or rather assumed) that the velocity acquired in such descents depends onl'
on the drop."
The rest of the third day's "dialogue" rings changes in Galileo's very beau
tiful theorem that descent along all chords beginning at the top or endinj
at the bottom of a vertical circle takes place in the same time. This trutl
prompts a "very beautiful ... reflection" from Sagredo. Let a great numbe
of balls be released at the same time along planes spreading downwart
in all directions from a single point. The balls lie on a circle that grows it

time. Another way of producing a widening circle of motion is to drop a
pebble into a still pond; but whereas in the first case the expanding circles
stay tangent to one another at the point of launch, in the second they spread
outward from the pebble's splash as center. These considerations elicit from
Simplicio his most original contribution. "Since we can assign as the site of
such emanations the lowest center as well as the highest spherical surface, I
believe that some great mystery may perhaps be contained in these true and
admirable conclusions-I mean a mystery that relates to the creation of the
universe ... and perhaps to the residence of the first cause." Had he a Pisan
Drop in mind? Salviati does not object but refuses to be drawn. "Such pro­
found contemplations belong to doctrines much higher than ours."78
From this sublimity Salviati falls to reading and proving increasingly tedious
theorems and artificial cases, of which Proposition XII is the finest specimen.
"If a vertical and a plane however inclined intersect between given horizon­
tal lines, and mean proportionals are taken between [each of] these and its
part contained between the intersection and the upper horizontal, the time of
movement in the vertical line will have, to the time of movement made in the
upper part of the vertical and then in the lower part of the cutting plane, the
same ratio as .... "79 who cares? Among the thirty such propositions that dis­
play Calileo's surpassing playfulness and cleverness in plane geometry there is
one that for its beauty and simplicity deserves notice. He asks for the ratio of
the time of fall along the vertical diameter AB = d (Figure 8.5) to the combined
times of the journeys along chords AE + EB. Since the velocity at E is the same
whether the body passes along AE or GE, the transit time tEB will be the same
for the broken journey or the straight shot GB. Now tEK = tCB - teE' and the
answer sought therefore is (since tAB = t AE) "t AE:(t AE + teB - teE)·" Now comes the
geometry. Galileo represents t AE by AE and tCE by GE, which works because
times of descent along planes of different slopes between the same parallels
are proportional to their lengths. He must now find a line along GB to repre­
sent tCB on the same scale. Let this line be GF = xGE, where x = (tCB:tCF) is the
required scaling factor. So x = (GB:AB)(t AB:teE) = (GB:AB)(AE:GE) = AG:GE. (The
last step follows from consideration of the similar triangles AGB, EGA.) We
have GF = AG. Since GE represents tCE' EF represents tEB and the ratio required,
t AB:(t AE +tEB) = AE:(AE + EF), the simple form that Galileo gives.so
It remained to praise. Sagredo: "[W]ith what ease and clarity, from a
simple postulate, he deduces the demonstrations of so many propositions!"
Salviati: "[O]nly now has the door been opened to a new contemplation,

full of admirable conclusions, infinite in number." Sagredo: "[W]hen these
[ demonstrations] have passed into the hands of others of a speculative turn
of mind, [they] will become the path to many others, still more marvelous."
Descartes: "[Galileo's] way of writing in dialogues with three persons who
do nothing but praise and exalt his inventions in turn certainly makes the
most of his wares.'?"
Day4
Simplicio arrives, Salviati starts to read. They approach what Galileo con­
sidered to be his greatest discovery. The subject is the trajectory of cannon
balls compounded from a uniform rectilinear motion arising from their
projection and a constantly acting downward acceleration exercised by the
earth. Although a shot at pointblank would, on Galileo's physics, continue its
"horizontal" motion in a circle concentric with the earth, he treats it as linear
because the distances under consideration are small relative to the earth's cir­
cumference. Thus Proposition 1: "When a projectile is carried in motion com­
pounded from equable horizontal and from naturally accelerated downward
[motion], it describes a semi-parabolic Iine."" Hold on, Salviati, Sagredo inter­
rupts; you will have to tell us about parabolas if you want Simplicio and me
to follow you. Salviati graciously excerpts some theorems of Apollonius to the
purpose. They came to this: the points on a parabola satisfy the condition that
the ordinates squared are proportional to their abcissae. A drawing (Figure
8.6) is worth a thousand words: p2:q2 = OP:OQ. In the case of point blank, the
ball shot from C (Figure 8.7) will proceed horizontally covering equal spaces
in equal times while it drops through spaces increasing as the square of the

times. The abcissae grow linearly, the associated ordinates quadratically, the

The dialogue ends with the reading of an entertaining table containing
315 numbers indicating the ranges and heights to which cannons aimed at
elevations from 1° to 90° would send their shots. There are certain condi­
tions: the gunners use identical balls fired with identical charges; the guns
and their targets stand on the same horizontal surface; and everybody
neglects the resistance of the air. To this last restriction Simplicio rightly
objects; Salviati counters, wrongly, by adducing the almost simultane­
ous fall of bodies of different weights and substances, and the almost iso­
chronous beats of pendulums, as evidence that the atmosphere does not
offer much friction to objects moving with the speed of cannon balls. In any
case, Salviati declares, eager to get on to the calculations whether realistic
or not, "to deal with such [messy] matters scientifically, it is necessary to

342
GALILEO
abstract from them. We must find and demonstrate conclusions abstracted
from the impediments ... "84
The calculations toward which Salviati pushes the others are exemplary
for their form, power, and unnecessary difficulty. To help appreciate their
nature, a sketch of a simpler account, conceptually available to Galileo, will
be helpful. In Figure 8.8, a is the elevation, GD = R/2 half the range, BD = h
the height of the trajectory, A the intersection of the tangent of the orbit at
G with the axis AD. At B the upward velocity of projection, vsina, equals the
downward velocity gt acquired in the time t since firing; in this time the hori­
zontal velocity vcosa has carried the shot through the half-range GO; hence
R = zvcosœ . (vsina)/g = (v2/g)sima, or, as Galileo would have expressed it in
proportion, R:Ro = sinzccsinzrx., where ao is an arbitrary reference point. The
obvious choice, which Galileo makes, is ao = 45°, so that R:Ro = sima. Evi­
dently R is greatest when a = 45°. The properties of sima make the ranges at
elevations equidistant from 45°, like 40° and 50°, equal. The height h may be
obtained most instructively by supposing that the shot initially fell from rest
through AB during time t and, after reaching B, fell again from rest through
h in an equal time t. Therefore AD = 2h, and, since tan a = 4h/R, we have
h = (v2/g) . sin-o, or, old style, h:ho = sin-o. Galileo's tables did not require
much calculation by him: R is a standard list of sines, which he could have
found in Copernicus, h of sines squared."

Galileo goes about gunnery backwards. He begins not from the gun G
but from the summit B, a relic of his experiments with inclined planes. To
proceed geometrically as much as possible, he replaces w, the horizontal
velocity at B, with the distance, q = PB, which a body would have to fall to
attain w on arriving at B: from the law of free fall, w oc�q. Now let the body
move horizontally from B with velocity wand simultaneously begin to fall
again from rest. By the time it arrives at G its vertical velocity will be pro­
portional to �h. Hence at G the square of the total velocity v goes as q + h
and its direction or elevation is given by tana = �(h/q). The half-range R/2 =
wt = �(2gq) . �(2h/g) = 2�(hq). The discussion centers at first on trajectories
that have a constant range and, consequently, different total velocities
proportional to �(q+h) on arriving at G. It is useful to know that the mini­
mum value of v, and so of v', for which the shot descending from B has the
half-range R/2 occurs at 45°. There tana = 1, q = h = R/2, and q + h = R. If
tana >1, h > q; if tan a < 1, h < q; in either case q + h > R. Galileo takes from
this analysis that a shot propelled in the reverse direction, from G, would
require the least charge for a given range if aimed at an elevation of 45°.
But gunners cared more to know how ranges differed by elevation if they
employed standard charges and balls. Taking v or v2 as a measure of charge,
Galileo geometrized their problem by making charge proportional to q + h
or �(q + h). The restriction to constant charge came to requiring q + h to be
a constant for all trajectories."
We may reasonably call this God's view of gunnery since Galileo explicitly
related it to the Pisan drop of the Dialogue: the idea that the Creator placed
the planets in their orbits by dropping them all from the same point and
converting their vertical motions into horizontal ones when He was satis­
fied with their performance. As we know, Galileo had a special fondness for
this brave conjecture. Here he put it into Sagredo's mouth "in the guise of
a true story." To check it out required knowledge of planetary speeds "and
the distances from the center about which they turn," information, Sagredo
continued, now available through "very competent astronomical doctrines."
To this whiff of Copernicanism Salviati replied that the Academician had
told him once that he had made the necessary computation, "and also that
he found it to answer very closely to observations." Here he drew back. The
Academician had not wanted to talk more about it, "judging that he had
[already] discovered too many novelties that have provoked the anger of
many. So let us get on with our material.'?"

344
GALILEO
The problem now is to calculate the range for each degree of elevation under
the relations tan a = �(h/q), h + q = constant, R = 2�(hq). This formulation dis­
plays immediately the maximum at 45°: it comes to asking for the rectangle hq
with the greatest area of all rectangles with the same perimeter (h + q = const.).
Everyone knows the answer: the square h = q = R/2. It also indicates that for
values of a equidistant from 45° the range is the same. For whether h exceeds
or falls short of R/2 by an amount x, q must do exactly the reverse, and R =
2�[(R2/4) - x2] for both cases." So we have for the relative ranges R(a):R(45°)
for balls shot with the same charge,
R(a): R(45°) = �(qh): R/2 = hctna: R/2 = sima.
The last two steps come from h = qtan?œ and h + q = R.
As a reward for slogging through these demonstrations, Salviati offered
his friends a little "wonder and delight." Know then that a chain suspended
from two points on a horizontal line closer together than its length will take
the form of a parabola. Or almost." Simplicio was not delighted with this
news or with the geometry he had had to bear to learn a little physics. A
glance at what he might have to endure-+Calilco's old Archimedean propo­
sitions that the Academician had added to the book from which Salviati had
been reading-put him off completely. He did not participate in the fifth
day's discussion on percussion, which Galileo drew up after the publication
of Two new sciences. This was not farewell. Galileo loved Simplicio too much
to part with him and, as will appear, conjured him up for a last talk at his
deathbed."
8.3 LAST DAYS
Of the mind
Galileo's analysis of his fall, as he presented it to correspondents outside
Italy, was less penetrating than his analysis of the flight of cannon balls. It
all began with "calumnies, frauds, and conspiracies deployed 18 years ago
[recte, 19] to befuddle the authorities." Should they ever become public,
"my entirely religious and holy intentions [in campaigning for Copernicus]
would appear all the clearer.'?' Why then the plots? "The principal, rather
the unique and only cause of my downfall [was] having discovered many

END GAMES
345
fallacies in received ideas, some of which I published ... [This] excited in the
minds of those who only wanted to be esteemed learned such disdain that,
as they are very clever and powerful, they managed to suppress what I had
found and published and to block the publication of what remains to me to
bring to light." Everything is prohibited, past and future." Galileo shut his
eyes to the evidence that Urban's inflexibility had nothing to do with aca­
demic jealousy, or, by 1636, with a sense of personal insult. When Noailles
undertook to persuade the pope that Galileo had not intended a slight by
allowing Simplicio to describe Urban's medicine, Urban replied, "we know
it, we know it," but added, as Galileo relayed the report to Micanzio, "reading
my Dialogue was most pernicious to Christianity,"?'
Urban carried his pastoral care in this matter to the extraordinary degree
of reserving to himself the authority to grant exemptions to read the Dia­
logue. He did not give permission easily." Typically bishops and inquisitors
dealt with applications for exemptions on a need-to-read basis. Urban's
insistence on attending to so small an administrative matter while still deeply
engaged in war and nepotism measures his fear that the program of reading
the book of nature without restrictions might shred the wholesome doctrine
with which he hoped to protect the church against every challenge based on
natural science or unaided reason. Urban's vigilance gave Galileo an oppor­
tunity to show once again how narrowly he too viewed the great contest. To
Micanzio, who wrote with delight that the notoriety of the edicts of 1616 and
1633 were converting mathematicians to Copernicus everywhere, the Pris­
oner of Arcetri replied that he did not like the news because it might stir up
the inquisitors. "Since licensing reading of the Dialogue is now reserved to
the pope alone, I can reasonably fear that finally even the memory of it will
be destroyed."?' This extravagant judgment suggests that Galileo could no
more remove his struggle over the freedom to philosophize from the narrow
confines of Rome and Florence than he could think himself free from the
earth when reasoning about the unforced motion of bodies. The prohibited
Dialogue was then so sought after in Italy that it sold for as much as six scudi
a copy." That was a month's salary for a junior mathematician.
Despite the severe constraints on him, Galileo did not intend to leave the
field to small-minded adversaries. As Ariosto wrote, "Everyone runs to gather
wood from the tree the wind blows down." Against these scroungers Galileo
would publish the inflammatory remarks he had seared into the margins of his
copies of their books-an enterprise luckily unrealized." A more promising

GALILEO
project, the republication of his works apart from the Dialogue in Latin, he
tried to sell to the Elseviers, with such inducements as translations done at
his expense and in his prison by a holy mathematician, and an offer to buy a
hundred copies for himself. The first Latin Opera did not appear in Calileo's
lifetime or from the Elsevier press." As stop gaps Galileo urged the flooding
of Italy with copies of Bernegger's translations of the innocuous manual on
the military compass and the provocative Letter to Christina, "to the confusion
of my enemies."?"
While completing the dialogue that became Two new sciences, Galileo tried
again to find a buyer for his method of finding longitude at sea. Negotia­
tions with the Spanish government had sputtered out in 1620. They resumed
briefly around 1630, when Galileo had the help of Ippolito Francini, an
accomplished lens maker employed in the Medici glass factory. Although
Galileo offered to send Francini and Vincenzo Galilei to Spain to repair
broken lenses and negotiate licenses, once again nothing came of it."? In
1635, in keeping with the shift of maritime power and his own business to the
North, Galileo turned to the Dutch, who had offered a substantial prize to the
inventor of a reliable method of finding longitude at sea. Galileo had better
tables and techniques on offer than before and a "[ovilab," an instrument
that represented the motion of Jupiter's satellites in a relatively easy, if not
an adequately exact, manner.'?' And this time he could offer an irresistible
incentive. Encouraged by his dealings with Elsevier and now interested more
in gaining credit than income from his invention, Galileo proposed to give it
to the Dutch government, "knowing it to be more able than all other powers
to put it to use since the confederation has a great many ships and, what is
more important, abounds with experts in astronomy." One of them, Mar­
tinus Hortensius (Maarten van den Hove), professor of mathematics at the
Athenaeum in Amsterdam and, later, at the University of Leyden, would be
Calileo's main technical contact with the Dutch authorities. In correspond­
ing with him directly or through Diodati, Galileo ran a risk, since Hortensius
was a Copernican as well as a heretic. He willingly ran it, however, trusting in
Hortensius's discretion, honesty, and acuteness of mind: "Since you are very
intelligent, I am certain that you will know that there is no other method
available to determine longitude than the wonderful properties of the stars
around Iupiter."!"
The States General of the United Provinces accepted Galileo's gift and, as
the Republic of Venice had done with the telescope, gave him a present in

END GAMES
347
return-a gold chain worth some 200 ducats. They also granted Horten­
sius a sum to procure instruments and an observatory to check observa­
tions and calculations and to find a way to reduce the proffered method to
the capacity of navigators.':" He appealed to Galileo for theoretical under­
pinnings (the parameters of the satellites' orbits) and instrumental help
(telescope lenses). But Galileo did not have the parameters or the time or
sight to recalculate them from "a mess of thousands of observations" and
offered instead their reification in the Jovilab. As for the lenses, he would try
to engage Francini, and, as a stopgap, would send the best lenses that had
ever been constructed, the telescope "with which I have discovered all the
celestial marvels." He could no longer use this companion of his night vigils,
"this discoverer of so many novelties in the heavens, the agent of the greatest
advancement of the noble science of astronomy."?' He was going blind.
In the summer of 1638, as Galileo awaited a visit from Hortensius and the
arrival of the gold chain, the vigilant new Inquisitor of Florence, Giovanni
Muzzarelli, got wind of the affair. Should agents of the United Provinces be
allowed to visit Galileo? Muzzarelli wrote Cardinal Antonio Barberini for
instructions. The answer: allow the visit only if the representatives are Cath­
olics from a Catholic country, and then under the restriction that there be
no discussion de motu terrae et stabilitate caeli. Galileo took the subtle hint and
rejected the visit and the gift, in place of which he had a word of commen­
dation from the cardinal. The inquisitor could not work out whether Gali­
leo behaved so well from fear of the danger of violating this latest order or
because he had not yet perfected the invention. In the inquisitor's opinion
he was unlikely ever to succeed, "being totally blind and with his head more
in the grave than his mind on mathematics."!" Galileo asked Diodati to tell
Hortensius not to bother to come, "for even if he should manage to find me
alive (which I doubt), he would find me altogether unable to give him the least
satisfaction." "Such is the malignity of my fate ... However I acquiesce in so
much adversity, since it would be vain temerity to wish to fight against the
necessity of destiny."!"
Galileo calculated correctly that the universe would not support his way
of navigating on earth, but he had not reckoned rightly the ways of fate. It
was not his death, but those of the commissioners assigned to evaluate his
method, Hortensius and the Italian-speaking Admiral Lorenzo Reael, that
effectively closed the business. Galileo tried to keep it alive by commission­
ing the new professor of mathematics at Pisa, Vincenzio Renieri, "a young,

GALILEO
vigorous man with the most acute vision," to observe the moons and calcu­
late ephemerides, and by urging the Dutch to continue discussions through
their ambassador to Venice. Micanzio took the matter in hand with his usual
optimism. "I beg you to dispose yourself to enjoy while still living the glory
of so marvelous an invention. Remember, it is the misfortune of mankind
when it does not receive the rare things and recondite inventions made by
able minds inspired by God and nature. Do not do this wrong to humanity,"!"
Galileo died before he could act on his old friend's admonition to live.
Galileo's method required an accurate method of telling time between
noon solar sightings. He boasted that he had a suitable clock, of such accu­
racy that if four or six of them were set going together, they would agree to
within a second in a month. "These clocks are really admirable for observers
of motion and celestial phenomena," Galileo wrote the Dutch States Gen­
eral, "and their construction is very simple." The idea behind this characteris­
tic bluff centered on a timekeeper regulated by a pendulum, of which Galileo
then had neither design nor model. The idea was not far to seek-Leonardo
and others had proposed it-but no one seems to have implemented it until
Galileo devised (in theory) a novel escapement that permitted a pendulum to
control the fall of a weight. He elaborated the theory in discussions with his
son Vincenzo and his disciple Viviani but had no prototype in hand when
he died. Vincenzo constructed one eventually, from which Viviani made a
sketch by which it became known in northern Europe.':" By then, 1655 or
1656, Christiaan Huygens had hit independently on a better design, not only
in construction but also in concept. Knowing that only if the bob traveled
along a cycloid would its period be independent of its swing, Huygens con­
strained the pendulum to wrap around cycloidal cheeks.!"
While trying to perfect navigation here below by tracking moons on high,
Galileo pushed ahead on several other problems that might seem beyond the
reach of an aged blind valetudinarian. Some dealt with astronomical obser­
vations, others with mechanics, and still others with fundamental questions.
Examples from each category will indicate how Galileo kept up, or rather
could not stop, the play of his "restless mind" during his long twilight."? "I
do not stop with my speculations, although with considerable damage to my
health, since along with my other troubles they deprive me of sleep, which
increases my melancholy at night."!"
Immediately after this sad disclosure, Galileo told his correspondent,
Micanzio, that he had made a "most admirable discovery in the face of the

END GAMES
349
moon." Observers over the centuries always found that the moon always
presents precisely the same face to us. "I find it is not true." It turns slightly
in all possible ways, left and right, up and down, and sideways, around the
line joining its center with the earth's. Astonishingly, these oscillations had
different periods, daily, monthly, and yearly. "Now what will your Reverence
say when you compare these three lunar periods with the diurnal, monthly,
and annual motions of the sea, over which everyone agrees the moon is
the arbiter and overseer?" These guesses perplexed Micanzio if he remem­
bered that in the Dialogue Salviati had already pointed out the daily period
of lunar "libration" and referred it, correctly, to parallax: an earth-bound
observer looks at slightly different limbs of the moon when it rises and sets,
and only if and when it crossed his zenith could he see exactly what the
ideal astronomer placed at the earth's center would see. In 1632 Galileo had
offered the phenomenon as a way to show that the moon's orbit centered on
the earth."? But now he wanted to use it to give his condemned theory of
the tides a greater plausibility. The moon does indeed librate in some such
manner as Galileo guessed, although he did not see or describe the motions
he intuited.'!'
"The sky, the world, and the universe that my marvelous observations
and clear demonstrations enlarged a hundred or a thousand times beyond
what all the sages of all the ages before me had seen, are now diminished
and restricted for me to no more than the space my person occupies."!"
That did not prevent Galileo from improving the technique of observa­
tions he could not make. In the fall of 1637 he proposed determining the
period of a reference pendulum by counting its swings between successive
meridianal passages of the same star. To obtain the length of a pendulum
that beats seconds, so Galileo advised Baliani, just compute the period of
the reference pendulum from the z a-hour count of its swings and employ
the "golden rule" that periods of pendulums go as the square root of their
lengths.'!' This was a stratagem, not a clock, since the pendulum did not
regulate a machine. But once again, the blind seer pointed to the future.
The isochronous pendulum clock had become an essential instrument of
astronomy within a quarter century of Calileo's death. So much for time.
As for space, Galileo recommended determining small angular separations
by refining the game with strings he had developed to "measure" stellar
diameters. Substitute a rectangular upright beam on a distant mountain
for the string and look through a telescope for a star that the beam just

350
GALILEO
blocked from view. A little geometry would then produce the diameter of
the star, which Galileo still believed his telescope magnified. This sugges­
tion did not have a future. As the pendulum clock came in, so did microm­
eter wires, which cannot be fitted to Galilean telescopes. Already by his
death in 1642 the Keplerian form of the telescope, which would easily
accommodate a measuring grid at the common focal planes of its objective
and eyepiece, had superseded the type with which Galileo had made his
discoveries.t" It was said that a Frenchman in Turin, operating with such a
telescope 38 palms long, had seen waves on the maria of the moon.'!'
As for mechanics, during 1638 Galileo dictated a Day 5 on percussion to
add to the already published four-days' work in Two new sciences. Calileo's
former student, Father Paolo Aproino, who had died that March, joined Sal­
viati and Sagredo as a substitute for Simplicio. Aproini easily outdid Sim­
plicio in knowledge of mechanics and admiration of "the greatest man who
has ever lived."!" Day 5 is entirely qualitative and, for Galileo, weak. He had
spent thousands of hours (he said) trying to understand why a large static
weight cannot move a nail easily sent home by the blows of a relatively light
hammer. His favorite technique of reducing mechanical problems to the
action of a lever suggested an analogy between, on the one hand, the lifting
of a great weight through a short distance by the displacement of a small
force through a great distance and, on the other hand, the slow progress of
the nail under wide swings of the hammer. But that did not take him far and
the Fifth Day finished a fragment.'!"
Torricelli tried to finish it using the quintessential Galilean technique
of replacing the mechanics of percussion by the kinematics of free fall. A
descending weight adds at each instant a degree of momenta to all the other
momenti previously acquired in its descent; the "power" of percussion lies
in the accumulation, which is to the static "force" of the same weight as the
number of momenti is to unity. Since the time of fall can be divided into an
infinite number of indivisible instants, the power of percussion, "which wins
the crown of the greatest of all marvels," was wonderful indeed, being in
principle infinite. Neither the master's kinematics of natural acceleration nor
his construction of matter and motion from "infinite" indivisible infinitesi­
mals equipped the disciple to develop a successful dynamics!"
Galileo returned to basics in response to Fortunio Liceti (Plate 7), a Paduan
Aristotelian in Cremonini's mould but without his style. In 1639 Liceti pub­
lished a book on the phosphorescent Bologna stone, which he put forward

as a model of the secondary light of the moon. On this analogy, the moon's
surface imbibes light from the sun and releases it in the dark just like (though
slower than) the phosphor from Bologna. It followed that Galilco's expla­
nation of moonglow was wrong. Galileo replied with a few of his typical
compliments, which Liceti took in good part and published, with Galilee's
permission, in a new edition of his book. The encounter with Liceti caused
Galileo to review his attitude toward Aristotle. The analysis led to a star­
tling conclusion. "I am impugned as an impugner of the Peripatetic doctrine,
whereas I claim (and surely believe) that I observe more religiously the Peri­
patetic or I should rather say the Aristotelian teachings than do many who
wrongfully put me down as averse [to them]."!"
"That's news to me," Liceti replied, "I'd rather gathered the contrary from
your writings." Galileo returned his reasons for admiring Aristotle. First of
all, his logic, his rules for right reasoning, his demonstratio potissima. From his
study of mathematical demonstrations, Galileo had mastered this logic; con­
sequently and happily, "very rarely have I fallen into mistakes in my argu­
mentation. Thus far, therefore, I am a Peripatetic." Secondly, Aristotle put
sense experience before reasoning. "[W]e should deny authority to ourselves
wherever we find that sense shows us the contrary." People who prefer Aris­
totle's teaching to their own sense experience, and distort his philosophy
to cover their errors, are not good Aristotelians. "I am sure that if Aristotle
should return to earth he would accept me among his followers on account
of my few but conclusive contradictions [of him]." Aristotle had taught that
the Heavens do not alter because he had detected no change in them. If he
could see what Galileo had found, he would grant that they are not immuta­
ble because everyone sees them change.':"
Liceti wrote faster than ordinary men read, about a book a week it was
said. One of the three he sent Galileo late in 1640 proved that the earth occu­
pies the center of the universe. That, snapped Galileo, "is among the least
worthy of considerations in all astronomy." We do not know the shape of the
universe or whether it has a center. A more sensible question is whether the
earth is at the center of the planetary system. It permits a decisive answer:
"no." The appearances of Mars show plainly enough that we are far from the
center of its motions. "One place that could almost be put as the center for all
planets but the moon would be the sun ... " Give up Aristotle on this point,
Liceti! He was just plain, incontestably wrong to put the earth at the center
of the universe. W In writing this Galileo too was wrong, since it violated his

352
GALILEO
solemn oath not to teach Copernican theory. But no harm could come of it.
On this point his correspondent was not teachable.
The most basic of texts for Galileo was Euclid's Elements. At the very end of
his life he began a new dialogue to clarify for Sagredo and Simplicio the Eucli­
dean theory of proportion on which his geometrical physics relied. They had
no difficulty with proportions containing only whole numbers, as, say p =
51:119. It holds because the first number when increased by a certain factor
equals the third, and the second increased by the same factor (in this case 17)
equals the fourth. No ambiguity resides in the innocent word "equal." But
what if the proportion relates continuous magnitudes, like line segments?
Galileo had labored to show in his first proposition on motion in Two new
sciences that if a body moves with a constant speed, the times required to
pass through different spaces will be as the spaces: representing times by the
lines AB, CD, and the corresponding distances by the lines WX, YZ, AB:CD =
WX:YZ. But since the geometrician cannot in general assign whole numbers
to lines, what are we to make of "equal"? Galileo appealed to a Euclidean
definition. That did not satisfy Sagredo. "[I've] long entertained doubts about
that definition." Simplicio: "I never encountered a more serious obstacle than
this, in the little of geometry which I studied in school." Their reasons for
puzzlement may be clear from the offending definition: "Magnitudes are said
to be in the same ratio, the first to the second and the third to the fourth,
when, if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first and third, and any
equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the former equimultiples
alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short of, the latter equimultiples
respectively taken in corresponding order." People have cracked their heads
for 23 centuries over the meaning and utility of this formulation.':"
Salviati clarifies the definition by introducing the concept of "some­
what greater [or less] than necessary." Thus, if a is just a little larger than
needed to make a:b = c:d, then xa:xb > yc:yd and xa:yb > xc:yd; which, with a
little reductio ad absurdum, Salviati makes equivalent to Euclid's definition.
Since the argument satisfied Simplicio, it should be obvious to the read­
er.I2S Galileo dictated this fragment to Torricelli, who arrived in Arcetri
in October 1641, fresh from the hands of "our intrepid Maecenas," the
"most learned and very famous Monsignor Ciampoli." With Torricelli's
arrival, Galileo had the fortune usually enjoyed only by royalty of having
two generations of his successors living with him.'> Torricelli became
mathematician to Ferdinando II soon after Galileo died. On Torricelli's

untimely death in 1647, at the age of 39, Viviani came into his birthright
and held the post into the eighteenth century.
Of the body
In 1634 Spanish troops brought the plague to Munich. Ten thousand peo­
ple died, among them Galileo's sister-in-law and four of her children.
Michelangelo's once numerous family was reduced to Galileo's nephews,
Vincenzo and Albert(in)o. Galileo sent them money through Micanzio and
invited them to Arcetri. Before they received his invitation Albertino wrote
describing their plight. "It made me weep to read it."127 Galileo's losses in
1634-his dearest daughter and tenderest friend Maria Celeste, three nieces
and a nephew, his sister-in-law, and his freedom-would have drawn a tear
from Torquemada. To lighten his darkening days there remained of his
nuclear family his son Vincenzo and Vincenzo's wife and children, and his
estranged daughter, Suor Angelica. Vincenzo shared his father's interests in
mechanical devices and poetry. We already know one consequence of this
alliance, the first semi-practical pendulum clock. Another was a meeting
between Galileo and Milton. The English poet had attended a literary soci­
ety in Florence to which Vincenzo belonged. With Vincenzo as intermedi­
ary, Milton satisfied his wish to see the famous man who could not see, "the
starry Galileo with his woes," "the famous Galileo, grown old a prisoner of
the Inquisition, for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan
and Dominican licensers thought."!"
Although a prisoner, Galileo could have visitors, even heretics provided
they were not mathematicians, and over-night and long-staying guests.
Viviani stayed almost three years, Marco Ambrogetti, the Latin translator,
20 months, Torricelli three months; and Piarist monks, Clemente Settimi
and his colleagues, put at Galilco's disposal by direct order of their gen­
eral, remained with him when he needed them. The Olivetan friar Vincen­
zio Renieri, who updated the calculations for Galileo's longitude method,
frequently came to talk and compute.'?" The poet Giovanni Carlo Coppola
amused Galileo in January 1637 by reading his play Nozze degli dei, performed
later in the year at the wedding of Ferdinando 11.130 Castelli stopped by a
few times while on Benedictine or Barberini business, but only after special
pleading as he was too close intellectually and emotionally to Galileo for
Urban's comfort.

354
GALILEO
Toward the very end, in 1641, Urban permitted the brief visit durin:
which Castelli proposed Torricelli as an assistant. Later that year, under tigh
restrictions, Castelli returned to Arcetri to help Galileo prepare for death
The authorities at first prescribed three interviews in the presence of wit
nesses. But the old reprobate's soul could not be prepared for its upcornin:
journey so easily and Castelli appealed for indefinite access. Urban agreed
under threat of automatic excommunication should their discussion of th
destinations of deceased Christians touch on "the opinion about the earth'
motion condemned by the Supreme and Universal Inquisition."!" Apar
from Vincenzo Galilei, Torricelli, and Viviani, most of those who brough
solace and diversion to Galileo during his later years at Arcetri were clerics
even friars, though, of course, no Jesuits or Dominicans. Galileo could retaii
the friendship of monks in minor or less assertive orders, like the Oliverans
Piarists, Servites, and Benedictines, but not of members of powerful ones.
After 1637 Galileo carried on his still imposing correspondence througl
amanuenses. He exchanged letters with Micanzio, Diodati, the Dutch Ion
gitude hunters, Castelli, Florentine gentlemen, and local courtiers up t<
the grand duke, without reprimand or reprisal. A particularly interestinj
correspondence took place with Francesco Rinuccini, the Tuscan agent it
Venice, whose mathematical interests had qualified him to attend the famou
reading of Galileo's sentence and abjuration at inquisitorial headquarters iI
Florence in 1633. Rinuccini asked about Ariosto and Tasso. Unfortunately
Galileo replied, since he had lost the book in which he had recorded hi
analysis and could not repair the loss by reading, he could only supply a fev
parallels from memory. They were all quite exact.!? In return, Rinuccini sen
Galileo news to rejoice a Copernican. It appeared that Pieroni had detecter
stellar parallax! Galileo replied as if Urban were at his elbow: "The falsir
of the Copernican system must not be doubted, especially by us Catholics
who have the irrefragable authority of Holy Scripture interpreted by th,
greatest masters in theology ... The conjectures of Copernicus and his fol
lowers offered to the contrary are all removed by that most sound argument
taken from the Omnipotence of God," that is, Urban's Simple. After statinj
it, Galileo rejected the implication that nothing can be known for certair
by the light of reason. "Just as I deem inadequate the Copernican observa
tions and conjectures, so I judge equally, and more, fallacious and errone
ous those of Ptolemy, Aristotle, and their followers, when [even] withou
going beyond the bounds of human reasoning their inconclusiveness car

END GAMES
355
be very easily discovered." As for Pieroni's argument, no doubt if correct
it would displace the earth from the center, but as it depended on delicate
measurements within the likely margin of error, it could not carry the day.
A later reader shocked at this opinion scratched out Galileo's signature from
the letter transmitting it. Apparently he or she did not understand Calileo's
need or mastery of dissimulation.133
Despite the attention of friends and the distraction of work, Galileo suf­
fered grievously during his last four years at Arcetri. Blindness came over
him during 1637. From the symptoms he described-fluxions from one eye
and then the other, progressive decline with occasional improvements­
doctors have diagnosed his problem retrospectively and variously. The most
recent and authoritative assessment points to glaucoma probably unrelated
to Calileo's chronic illnesses.134 Naturally he complained of "melancholy."!"
"Horsù, Sig.r Galileo, caro, caro, allegramente," "now, dear dear Galileo, be
more cheerful," wrote Castelli, in an effort to reconcile his teacher to perpet­
ual darkness. God tests those he loves (Plate 4). Castelli sent the same cheer
to Dino Peri, the moribund professor of mathematics at Pisa. "I rejoice with
you [Sig.r Peri] as I see you visited with such trials by the benign and loving
hand of God ... I beg you to tell our dear Sig.r Galileo about my joy so that he
can mix this feeling with his tribulations and joyfully bear them for the love
of God ... [W]hat he now seminat in lacrimis in exultatione metet, et si ad vesperum
demoratur fletus, ad matutinum erit laetitia."136
Castelli advised Galileo to seek spiritual help and, when that did not suf­
fice, to request permission from Rome to go to Vincenzo's house for easier
access to medical care. Galileo made the request using Castelli's draft. The
Holy Office sent Inquisitor Muzzarelli to check that Galileo, known to it
as a hypochondriac, was not malingering. The inquisitor turned up with
a doctor and without an appointment. "I found him totally blind," Muz­
zarelli reported. "Moreover, he has a very serious hernia, constant pain,
and insomnia, which he and his servants say prevent his sleeping more
than one hour in 24; for the rest, he looks more like a cadaver than a living
person." Muzzarelli recommended that Galileo go to his son's for medical
help. In approving this grace, Urban directed that Galileo not go into Flor­
ence and that he not have visitors with whom he could discuss "his damned
opinion of the motion of the earth." As the cardinal nephew informed the
Inquisitor of Florence, "His Holiness [orders] particularly that he be pro­
hibited under the severest penalties from discussing such material with

GALILEO
anyone at all." A further concession granted Galileo permission to atteru
mass in a nearby church on holidays, "provided that there is no crowd.':"
Vincenzo agreed to enforce these conditions, "as he is most grateful ... fo
the favor" and (we deal here with a cynic by profession) "it is in his OWl
interest that his father behaves properly and lives a long time, since witl
[Galileo's] death the thousand scudi he receives annually from the granl
duke will stop."!"
In the fall of 1638 Galileo added to his usual complaints colic, lack e
appetite, and delirium. "I find everything disgusting, wine absolutely bal
for my head and eyes, water for the pain in my side ... my appetite is gon<
nothing appeals to me and if anything should appeal [the doctors] will pro
hibit it. These, my friend [Diodati] are great trials for me. But much wors
are the afflictions of my mind and imagination .... "139 In September 1639 h
cries out to Castelli in arthritic pain, "I can no longer stand it." In Februar
1640, he describes his situation as a Hell on earth, or rather, still the exac
geographer of the inferno, "a hell on the earth's surface.T" His last illnes
began in November 1641. A visitor found him suffering from a fever that hal
confined him to bed for two weeks. Still, he was not done. "He told me ths
he had the greatest satisfaction in the new mathematician Torricelli and the
he had derived great pleasure from listening to him and Viviani argue ave
some new dcmonstrations.t'':"
Galileo died on the evening of 8 January 1642 in the presence of his so:
and his mathematical protégés. His corpse was deposited at his wish i:
Santa Croce, but not, as he had wanted, in the tomb of his ancestors. Ne
wishing to challenge the Roman authorities by commemorating the dear.
of a man once vehemently suspected of heresy, the family deposited Gali
leo's mortal remains in an obscure chamber under the bell tower. Gran
Duke Ferdinando planned a more fitting monument, a precise counterpar
of Michelangelo's, in the great nave. When Urban learned of the plan h
summoned Ambassador Niccolini to an informal chat. "He wanted to te
me that it would not be a good example to the world for [us to erect suel
a monument], as that man had been here before the Holy Office for a ver
false and erroneous opinion, which he had also impressed upon man
others ... " The cardinal nephew delivered the same message to Ferdinand
through the Florentine Inquisitor. "[I]t is not good to build mausoleum
to [such men] ... because the good people might be scandalized and prej
udiced with regard to Holy Authority."142 The different routes by whicl

END GAMES
357
uncle and nephew reasoned to the same conclusion underscore Urban's
irrationality in the affair. To him Galilee's doctrine remained dangerous
and contagious; to his executive secretary, it was a matter of preserving
authority. Either way, Urban denied Galileo his tomb in Florence as he had
done Sarpi his in Venice, uniting in limbo the two old friends who had had
the courage to mobilize natural science and ecclesiastical history against
the established order.
Viviani devoted much of his life and fortune to bringing a suitable
memorial into being. He had a bust sculptured from Galileo's death mask,
designed an appropriate monument, and developed the pious fiction that
Galileo came into the world as his soulmate Michelangelo left it. The fiction
supported a wealth of analogies that promoted Galileo to equality with the
"master ... sent by God as an example of what an artist could be." At the same
time Viviani painted a picture of his master as a true Catholic willing to put
aside his opinions in full and unfeigned obedience to the determinations of
Holy Church. Ever vigilant to remove the slightest impediment to rehabilita­
tion, he tried to suppress the printing of Galileo's letters to Sarpi in an edi­
tion of the excommunicated monk's works. Despite these moves neither the
Medici nor the Inquisition wanted to reconsider the monument.v" Viviani
responded by making the façade of his house into the memorial mentioned
earlier. Erected to coincide roughly with the soth anniversary of Galileo's
death, it may still be consulted in the Via Sant'Antonino by patient lynx-eyed
Latinists arrested and flattered by the salutation, "0 passerby of right and
generous mind! [Plate 16]"144
Reading on, the right-minded wayfarer would learn the accomplishments
and discoveries, the biographical facts, and the sterling character of the dedi­
catee; the "ornament of Italy, light of Tuscany, delight of cultivated Europe,
beacon of a world philosophizing in darkness, garrison and guide to nature,
Oedipus of the wisdom of mortals." The notice concludes with the quali­
ties of the master that inspired the disciple to follow the way of truth. They
include, first of all, "the example of a life [lived] in the odor of sanctity." Gali­
leo's strict adherence to God's commandments, deep scientific knowledge,
and command of geometry enabled him to bring to light "a few truths from
among the infinite and eternal mysteries." He recognized that knowledge of
these truths could help humans draw closer to their God. Dealing with men
was more difficult and less certain, but Galileo knew how to do that too.
A true Galileist "comes firmly to the defense of truth and justice; flees like

GALILEO
the plague all lying, adulation, and hypocrisy; avoids leisure and laziness
writes of good deeds in bronze and of bad ones in air; rewards, at least witl
gratitude, those who help him; fulfills promises scrupulously and honors hi:
word; rejects sordid avarice and ill-gotten gains; gives wisely and employ:
honestly wealth honestly acquired ... "145 It appears that Viviani confusec
aspirations with achievements, ideals with realizations, and Galileo with tlu
Man of Galilee.
8.4 THE END OF THE AFFAIR?
Off the Index
The uncertainty concerning the heretical status of Copernicanism took timt
to settle-some 200 years. A routine text by a professor of mathematics a'
the University of Rome, Giuseppe Settele, precipitated the dénouement. Set
tele submitted a book on modern, heliocentric astronomy to the Romar
censorship in 1820. The Master of the Sacred Palace, Filippo Anfossi, believ­
ing it a heresy, refused the license to print. With the help of people eager te
see this view of the matter exploded, Settele appealed to the pope, Pius VII
in whose person the Church had suffered the humiliation of incarceration b)
Napoleon. The pope referred the complaint to the Congregation of the Index
which granted the imprimatur, and to the Holy Office, which instructed th:
Master that by "contrary to scripture" the old inquisitors had meant no!
"contrary to faith" but "opposed to the traditional reading of scripture.'
Concerned more for his soul than for his job, Anfossi protested the finding:
of the congregations and refused the imprimatur until Pius ordered him te
grant it. That settled the question whether the heresy of which Galileo hac
been suspected was Copernicanism. The church silently removed all book:
from the Index that, like Galileo's, had a place there merely for their advo
cacy of Copernican theory. That was in 1835, in the first new edition of the
Index after the Settele affair.':"
In justification of its verdict, the Holy Office observed, without saying sc
publicly, that "[n]othing is opposed to defending Copernicus' opinion abou'
the motion of the earth in the manner in which it customarily is now held b)
Catholic authors." This was to acknowledge that the decree of 1616 had n01
been enforced in Italy for some time, not, in practice, since the middle of the

END GAMES
359
eighteenth century, when the censorship allowed or condoned the reprint­
ing of the condemned Dialogue. The earliest instance occurred in 1744, in an
edition of Galileo's Opere edited by Giuseppe Toaldo, later professor at the
University of Padua. To protect the innocent, Toaldo removed a few postils in
which Galileo had slipped into stating that the earth truly moves, and added
the further antiseptic of an introductory essay by a theologian on the theme
of humankind's incorrigible ignorance. "It seems that God, being jealous, as it
were, of the beauty and magnificence of his work, has reserved to himself the
perfect understanding of its structure, and the secrets of its motions."!"
The censorship licensed Toaldo's edition of the Dialogue because by then,
1744, Catholic astronomers already customarily employed the Copernican
system in their work. Good administrators had turned a blind eye to the
practice as it had its advantages and posed no threat to anything but an
authority they were powerless to exercise. Pope Benedict XIV was a good
administrator. He not only allowed Toaldo's edition but also struck the
general prohibition against Copernican works from the Index. He had not
thought it worth the candle, however, to do battle with the Anfossis of his
time over the Dialogue, which remained indexed.':"
With a little fudging, the customary handling of Copernicus by Italian
astronomers between the defeat of Galileo and the victory of Settele can
be divided into four successive phases. During the first, from 1633 to 1670,
the old interdiscipline of Aristotelian physics and Thomistic theology broke
down under the weight of Galileo's falling bodies and Descartes' corpuscu­
lar philosophy. By 1670 most informed people recognized that no physical
argument of the sort developed by Tycho-a spinning earth would leave
clouds and birds behind, and so on-could be sustained. The break can be
pinpointed. In 1651, Giovambattista Riccioli, 5J, published a very valuable
compendium of the astronomy of his day, an Almagestum novum, or updating
of Ptolemy, which contains among ten thousand other things 126 arguments
philosophical, mathematical, and theological for and against Copernicanism
(49 pro, 77 contra).':" Among the physical arguments, Riccioli judged those
aimed against a stationary sun equivocal, but those against a moving earth
decisive. Galileists were too demoralized in 1651 to protest effectively. When
Riccioli repeated the old arguments in 1665 several had become bold enough
to do so, and in 1669 Riccioli conceded that none of the physical or math­
ematical arguments he had marshaled in his Almagest decided the question.
Copernicanism could not be judged false in philosophy. There remained in

GALILEO
proof of the moving sun and stationary earth only the decree of the church.
"I firmly hold, infallibly believe, and openly confess [the earth-centered
cosmos] ... solely at the command of the faith, by the authority of Scripture,
and by the direction of the Roman See."150
Riccioli was clear that he rejected Copernicanism in obedience to Rome,
not because the Catholic faith required him to do so. It was not a heresy. In
the Almagestum novum he had declared, with the permission of his superiors
that the Holy Office on its own could not proclaim a heresy or an article ol
faith. Only a pope or council approved by a pope could so bind the church
"It is not a matter of faith that the sun moves and the earth stands still on the
strength of the decree of the congregation; but only at the most by force oi
the Holy Scripture on those to whom it is morally evident that this is God's
revelation." Still, prudence and obedience obliged Catholics to observe the
decree, "or at least to teach nothing contrary to it."151 And yet, "the deeper
one dips into the Copernican hypothesis, the more ingenuity and precious
subtlety one may unearth." Had only Copernicus presented his theory ex sup­
positione! The same went for Galileo, "a mathematician of immense powel
wonderfully skilled in astronomy: he would have been greater still if he hac
put forward the opinion of Copernicus as a mere hypothesis."!"
During the second phase, 1670-1710, Catholic astronomers gained the
right to teach and even develop Copernican theory if they designated i1
expressly and repeatedly as an hypothesis. Bolder writers, like Honoré Fabri
5], picking up on Riccioli's demonstrations that Copernicanism was n01
heretical, supposed that the decrees against it arose from prudence and sur­
prise, and that as knowledge progressed they would be amended.'>' The cen­
sorship allowed the fig leaf of fictionalism. In 1685, the Master of the Sacree
Palace reported to the cardinals of the Holy Office that he had required the
addition of the words "erroneous hypothesis" to the title page of a book or
the Copernican system and to the text the phrase, "Since the Church has
declared that the Holy Scripture expressly teaches the contrary, this systerr
cannot be defended in any way." The cardinals complimented him on his
vigilance. But he and they allowed the book's publication.'>' Apparently the
effective administrative ruling in 1685 was to tolerate Copernicanism as ar
ineradicable evil after warning the faithful against it, as modern societies
allow the sale of cigarettes bearing a notice of their harmfulness.
That was the practice of good administrators. When zealots took over, as
during the reign of Innocent XII (1691-1700), who believed in discipline anc

END GAMES
suffered from literalness, the church could turn its machinery against people
who lusted after novelties. Thus Innocent targeted some lawyers and doctors
in Naples who followed Copernicus and Descartes. But his intervention ended
in the ejection of his agents.!" His successor, Clement XI (1700-21), whose
court intellectual Francesco Bianchini introduced Newtonian ideas into Italy
and looked for evidences of the earth's motion, seems not to have cared much
about a question of no significance compared with the problems presented
to him by the War of the Spanish Succession.!" His inquisitors turned a blind
eye to the unauthorized republication of the Dialogue in 1710 by a Neapolitan
printer who enjoyed bringing out prohibited works.
Anyone willing to take the trouble to turn philosophy into poetry might
teach up-to-date cosmology without the protective shield "ex suppositione"
otherwise required. Thus in 1704, in the first of several editions of his Philosophia
nova-antiqua, Tommaso Ceva, SJ, versified Descartes and Newton, accepted
Calileo's theory of motion (but not his cosmology), rejected most of Aristo­
tle, detailed the system of Copernicus and ascribed Protestant preference for
it to opposition to the pope. This mongrel mixture was used for many years
in Jesuit schools as a text in astronomy and an exemplar of Latin poetry.'? A
Sicilian poet, Tommaso Campailla, then set Cartesian philosophy to poetry
in an extravaganza on the education of Adam by the angel Raphael, whose
divine physics was nothing other than the vortices of "l'irnrnortale Renato e de
la Carte." The Royal Society of London, amazed to discover so bright a light in
Sicily, sent Campailla a copy of Newton's Principia, perhaps in the hope that he
would versify it too. The desired poetical counterpart to Descartes was com­
pleted only in 1752. The author, Benedict Stay, SJ, required 24,000 lines for the
job, about two-thirds of a Furioso. It took forty years to print.!"
The third phase in the rehabilitation of Copernicus and Galileo ran from
1710 to 1760, from the requirement of explicit fictionalism (except in poetry!)
to pro-forma expressions of it. In the 1720S and 1730S, older astronomers
practiced the self-censorship they had interiorized earlier. Angelo Marchetti,
professor of logic, and the son of the professor of mathematics, at the Uni­
versity of Pisa, provides a good example. The second edition of his Brief
introduction to cosmology (1738) invites its readers to decide which among the
systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Tycho is "more like the truth and more
in conformance with the sacred dogmas of our Catholic faith." It offers some
guidance: Ptolemy's system is wrong; Copernicus', confirmed by "the great
Galileo," meets every reasonable test, but Catholics suspect it because "it

GALILEO
does not conform well with Divine Scripture and [because of] the sentence
against Galileo"; Tycho's, though neither simple nor coherent, is preferred
by Catholics obedient to the Sacred Congregation of Cardinals. And what
does the author prefer? "For my part I say ... that I do not intend to approve
the Copernican theory; but in everything and for everything, I defer to those
competent to judge the matter, contenting myself with having explained it in
the form in which its inventors proposed and approved it."159
The more relaxed approach of younger men toward 1760 is represented by
a Disputation on the diurnal motion of the earth (1756) by a successor of Marchetti,
the bold Barnabite Paolo Frisi. Modern astronomy, mechanics, and physics
were so many confirmations of the "most elegant and most celebrated opin­
ion of the great Galileo." New discoveries-Frisi mentioned the aberration
of light and the nutation of the stars-are decisive. "[They] can be explained
easily and wonderfully in the [Copernican] system ... Is this not a kind of cer­
tainty and demonstration?" Whereas on the hypothesis of a stationary earth,
neither the aberration nor the nutation can be explained, "or to explain them
intricate and arbitrary hypotheses, which are implausible when judged by
the light of reason, must be adopted.':"?
Frisi grew even bolder as documents pertaining to Galileo's trial became
public. Galileo had not only discovered fundamental truths but had also
worked to win for everyone the right to seek them until the Jesuits fiddled
the system to bring him down. The Jesuits did not reply to this provocation
or to the documents, published in 1775, supporting it. They could not. In
1773, under pressure from heads of state impatient with their intrigues, POpE
Clement XIV suppressed their order. This act, unimaginable in Calileo's time:
drove ex-Jesuits who wished to maintain the shreds of their previous life te
Austria or Russia. They formed a nucleus from which Pius VII reestablished
their order during the conservative reaction following the fall of Napoleon,
A few years later he began the official rehabilitation of Galileo by removing
the Dialogue from the Index."?
On the rota?
Galileo resides high on the short list of founders of modern physics and suf­
ferers for the freedom of thought. And he is still making progress, though his
momentum is slow, up the register of servants of the church. The first mile­
stone in this advance was the encyclical Providentissimus deus, issued in 1893 by

END GAMES
Pope Leo XIII, who some years earlier had made Thomism the official the­
ology and philosophy of the Church. Leo turned to Galilee's hermeneutics
to disarm attacks on scripture mounted by the higher critics, who treated
the bible as literature and exposed its many errors in history and science.
Leo removed scriptural statements about the natural world from the field
of battle by the device of accommodation. But whereas Galileo used accom­
modation to gain space for natural science, Leo required it to save space for
scripture. They agreed that God did not intend to teach physics through
Moses. They relied on the same arguments from Augustine to sustain their
positions. But Leo did not mention Calileo."? A century later Pope John Paul
II, who ranked Galileo better at theology than the congregation of cardinals
that condemned him, repaired Leo's omission.
The 300th anniversary of Galileo's death brought a second milestone. To
demonstrate the church's openness to science, Pope Pius XII, "filled with
the spirit of Galileo," commissioned an unrestricted biography of Urban's
bugbear.':" The commission went to Monsignor Pio Paschini, an historian
known for his balance. This virtue worried some of Pius' advisors, who had
the satisfaction of being proved right. Paschini took Galileo's part, declared
his condemnation an error, and blamed it on the Jesuits. The Jesuits objected
and Paschini's two-volume manuscript disappeared in the review mecha­
nism. In consolation, he was made a bishop. The next conspicuous oppor­
tunity to display eagerness to rehabilitate Galileo was the 400th anniversary
of his birth. That fell in 1964, during the Second Vatican Council. As a sign of
their program for the peaceful coexistence of science and religion, the popes
(John XXIII and Paul VI) authorized the printing of the defunct Paschini's
biography, which had been improved by the keeper of the Jesuits' archives.
John Paul II pointed to it as an example of openness in 1979 when he inaugu­
rated a multidisciplinary inquiry into the Galileo Affair. On this occasion he
endorsed Galileo's principles of hermeneutics. Perhaps he did not know that
in effect Paschini's biography had been indexed donee corrigatur and corrected
more severely than Copernicus' De revolutionibus.164
Although John Paul's committee sponsored several useful publications,
it did not resolve fundamental questions of responsibility. It was adrift in
lethargy and dullness when, at the pope's direction, the President of the
Pontifical Council for Culture, Cardinal Paul Poupard, who had served on
the committee since its inception, pulled its findings to a conclusion. The
world learned the result in 1992, 350 years after Galileo's death. Poupard's

GALILEO
conclusion adopted the analysis developed under the committee's aegis by
the German Jesuit Walter Brandmüller. It surprised unsophisticated people.
Brandmüller and Poupard reduced the collision between the cardinals
and Galileo to a no-fault accident. Galileo had proceeded correctly along
the difficult road of scriptural exegesis; the cardinals had negotiated with
equal expertise the equally difficult road of epistemology. Yes, the theolo­
gians knew more about the nature of science than Galileo, who mistakenly
thought he had proved Copernican theory, and Galileo knew more about
the business of theology than the theologians, who mistakenly took scrip­
ture as a guide to natural science. This counterintuitive and even comic
formulation raised Galilee's hermeneutics almost to the level of Urban's
medicine. The pope accepted it.165
John Paul might have been disappointed with the result that on the play­
ing field of theology and epistemology the cardinals and Galileo had man­
aged a draw. In his speech of 1979, from which the committee drew its terms
of reference, he had remarked that Galileo "had to suffer a great deal at the
hands of men and organisms of the church." The pope deplored this suf­
fering: Galileo was a good Catholic who believed as the pope did that there
could be no fundamental opposition between God's words and His works,
between scripture and science. Galileo did Catholics a singular service at
great personal cost by showing that the church must not oppose scripture
to proved or provable assertions about the natural world.I= This judgment
echoed in the more careful words of a pope the opinion expressed by a theo­
logian a quarter century earlier: Galileo's suffering before the Inquisition was
the fulfillment of his "providential purpose."167 God had appointed him to
instruct misguided theologians about the relationship between words and
works. The man who believed that human beings can reach truth by the light
of reason had beaten the pope who denied that humans can recognize truth
unaided by revelation.
Language like this describes saints and martyrs. In the heat of battle over
the status of Copernicus in 1616, Galileo represented his struggle as that
of a saint against devils.':" His disciples warmed to the theme. Immortal,
divine, "his fame will last as long as the universe"; "the bringer oflight to the
human mind," "one of those rare men destined by Providence to honor the
sublime works of His hands," he is the "father of all true students of nature."
"His mission was to restore human reason to the dignity it had lost for
centuries.T" He came to teach the church "a severe lesson in humility."!"

END GAMES
"For most people, Galilee's greatest claim to glory is to have offered himself
as a sacrifice for a cause that he had made his own. He entered into it with
all the enthusiasm, ardor, and passion of a man who believes himself called
from on high to the mission of revealing to the world the truth about the
motion of the earth-just as Providence had given him the grace to be the
first to see in the heavens new stars previously unknown to mortals."!" Suf­
fering, sacrifice, humility, mission, providential calling: elements for a case
for canonization begin to accumulate.
We already have the relics. Besides Galileo's instruments and a telescope
lens set in a reliquary, bits of his bones, now resident in museums, are avail­
able for higher purposes. Like many a true saint, some of his body parts exist
in greater quantities after death than in life. During his reburial in Santa
Croce in 1737, the curious or worshipful removed index fingers, a thumb,
and a vertebra. For a time there were two competing right index fingers, one
of which is displayed at the Museo Galileo in Florence along with two other
digits and a molar.l " Enough relics exist to stock the churches in Venice,
Padua, Florence, and Rome at which Galileo customarily worshipped. There
is also the beginning of a liturgy in a sonnet inspired by contemplation of
"the great Galileo's finger."!"
It might be objected that Galileo performed no miracles. What then were
the miracles of Thomas Aquinas? In fact, Galileo performed a stupendous
miracle. He obliterated the ancient distinction between the celestial and ter­
restrial realms, raised the earth to the heavens, made the planets so many
earths, and revealed that our moon is not unique in the universe. Not since
the creation had there been such a refashioning. Then there was the mira­
cle of himself, a rare combination of talents and personalities, who, despite
mania and depression, arthritis, gout, hernias, blindness, and overindulgence
in wine and wit, lived to write three books-the Messenger, the Dialogue, and
the Discourse-anyone of which would have given him enduring fame.
According to Galileo's mechanics, the slightest force can move the great­
est weight given sufficient time. The direction of motion is clear. Who can
doubt that within another 400 years the church will recognize Galilee's
divine gifts, atone for his sufferings, ignore his arrogance, and make him a
saint?

premise "all plants with broad leaves are deciduous" and the middle term, "vines
have broad leaves," we can infer that vines are deciduous, whereas from the premise
"all deciduous plants have broad leaves" and the middle term, "vines are deciduous,"
we may safely conclude that vines have broad leaves. Quite reassuring.

50. Drake, ibid., 58, and Mauri, in ibid., 82, 85, 95. There is also the typically Gali­
lean paradox that Aristotelians should be delighted with equants and eccentrics
and other mathematical constructs because they allow preservation of the physi­
cal principle that celestial motions must be circular (102, 124).
51. Mauri, Considerazioni (1976), ibid, 76. There are also Mauri's preference for the
generation of novae by conjunctions and his supposition that the moon has a
dull light of its own (108, 106).

discussed the roof experiment together. A slip in their translation (p. 45) and
in Damerow et al., Exploring (1992), 337, which follows Naylor, Isis, 71 (1980), 551,
makes hash of the last two sentences of Guidobaldo's text: they render a fatto as

to Poland; the evidence that Piersanti turned over the letters is their survival in
Galileo's papers.
50. SN, 65 (fate). Around "opposition," when closest to earth, Jupiter, Mars, and
Saturn (the "superior planets") appear to "retrograde," moving from east to west
in the direction of the diurnal motion of the stars, whereas most of the time they
move "directly," from west to east, in the direction of the sun's apparent path along
the ecliptic. On the Copernican theory, their retrogradation is a consequence of
the placement of the earth's orbit within that of the superior planets; on the Ptole­
maic theory, the phenomenon is just a brute fact. See Section 7.2 below.

55. Reeves, Painting (1997), 23-38, and Egerton, Heritage (1991), 248-50, suggest
that Galilee's training in perspective, which included rendering secondary light,

ideas of reason and justice do not restrain His actions, it is unlikely that our ideas
of propriety will.

in the invention of the telescope, 211-13. Misrepresentations: almost everything
concerning Tycho, 180-3, 191, 258, 271; and, of course, Sarsi, who did not sting,
unprovoked, like a scorpion (172). High moral tone: 188, 255, 260, 270, 272, 274.

assumed constant in its orbit, by displacing the center of the orbit from the
center of the earth. Kepler showed that, in addition, there was an inequality
arising from inconstant motion along the orbit. This produced the famous and
instructive battle between the whole- and the half-eccentrics; Heilbron, Sun

Locher and Scheiner exposed themselves to unnecessary ridicule by what appear
to be a typo. They say that at least six days are needed for fall from the moon a
constant velocity u and also that u = UA' uA being the velocity of the point A 01
the lunar sphere, which is nonsense (the journey would take under 4 hours). I
appears from their numbers for uA and for the corresponding velocity uy for,
point Y above Ingolstadt (uy = 2uA/3) that they took for the daily travel of the ball
along the vertical, the hourly travel of the point Y. In the latter case, u = (2/3)(uA/24
and the time of the journey is Rju = 36RjuA = 36/21t � 6 hours, which Scheiner­
Locher miswrote as 6 days.

the eucharist played an important role in Galilee's trial, receives confirmation
without requiring his special argument, to whieh he no longer holds, that the
trial of 1633 was a concession, allowing Galileo to plead guilty to a lesser offense
than undercutting the eucharistie miracle. Eucharistie considerations did play
a major part later in the condemnation of Descartes' writings; Armogathe and
